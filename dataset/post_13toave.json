    "selftext": " \n\nI wanted to know how feasible it is to just go on a hike, set up a tent and campfire openly (without any prior permission or just informing local authorities without any hassle) in forests/beaches/river banks in India. I see people abroad go on treks regularly without having to worry about police harassing them. Is something like that feasible in India too?\n\nI know the answer can change based on certain variables. So here's an overview of those that I can think of:\n\n(a) State: Maharashtra or Goa. If not sure about the answer for these states, you could also answer it assuming the question is for the state you know about.\n\n(b) Type of areas:\n\ni) No Protected/Sensitive/Military areas, but optionally consider rivers in wildlife sanctuaries too which might be land under the forest department. Or beach areas near coast which might be under coast guard\n\nii) What about areas where there is already some commercial camping activity and I just bring in my own tent there and start camping\n\n(c) What kind of camping? : Small tent, carries 3-4 people. Something like [this](https://ibb.co/B4myYSf). Simple bonfire made out of wood-stock. Cooking food on it.\n\n(d) Safety measures: Assume only being done in safe weather. No high tide or landslide warnings, etc.\n\nI would really love to go backpack trekking in India but not with these tour people who spoil the experience. I would appreciate your inputs on this. I made a similar question about rafting [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13to29d/legality_of_boatingrafting_in_indian_riverslakes/). If you have any idea about that, it would be great to hear about it from the community.\n\nLastly, if you could recommend some communities where I can ask this question, I would really appreciate it.",

        "It is not legal to camp anywhere in India. There is no legal provision for this in a public place. You’re not even supposed to enter a forest area without permission let alone camp there. Forest departments have executive and special permissions to detain/arrest you, even more than state police.\n\nIf you have seen someone doing this on a vlog or something and get away, it is only because the law enforcement is weak. If you’re caught, you’re on your own. Law cannot and will not be able to protect you.",
        "Seconded. Also you'd be subjected to invasion of wild life sanctuaries and intent to disturb their habitat or something similar and prone to legal penalties. Also some areas are scheduled to be tribal grounds which also may lead to penalties. Only a few scheduled Tribes are allowed to penetrate into forests, reserved or not in certain areas",
        "It's really sad India does not have more legal camping opportunities.\nBTW, op, some places you mentioned are home to king cobra. Be careful when going to wilderness areas.",
        "Hey OP, there are PLENTY of campgrounds in Maharashtra and Goa which are far from the \"touristy\" bits and will let you enjoy peace and tranquility. Just google campgrounds near wherever you're planning to go and you'll find dozens of good campsites. Often these are villagers who run a restro and have land behind the place that they'll let you camp for a reasonable fee, often it's 200-500₹. Some campsites may even have washrooms in the restro that you're allowed to use. Some are homestays that will let you camp in their backyards.\n\nI've camped several times over the last few years and never had to face any problems. If you're around Pune, there are many amazing spots in andharban where you can camp and most likely you'll not see another human for the entire duration of your stay. Another out of this world place is in Gokarna, called Paradise beach. It's about a 2hr trek from Om beach so it doesn't see many tourists, and there's no electricity there so you'll find only a handful of travelers all staying in tents, with some locals assisting with food and some light refreshments.",

        "We have lot of official treking places in India. You can eaily pay some money to get the ticket to go inside forest for treking but overnight stay always not legal in India. So my advice is that don't spend time and money on camping gears instead focus on trekking gears and come back to your vehicle at dawn. I also advice you to explore camper vehicle in india you can easily park this type of vehicle in almost all places in India and nobody will ask you anything.. just make sure you vehicle doesn't attract pedistrian. Park your vehicle next to nearby falls or beach nobody will ask you. We don't have parking tickets so technically you can live off your vehicle."
