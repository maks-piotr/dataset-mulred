    "selftext": "The overreaction to Modi being posed a challenging question after nearly a decade is only natural.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis particular prime minister has not been accustomed to encountering difficult inquiries in public. In fact, his encounters with probing questions seem almost... unnatural.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis ardent supporters have been indoctrinated to believe that the PM is not answerable to anyone for his actions. They are content with his scripted interviews and speeches, considering them sufficient. Blind trust and unconditional faith in his words are expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, he is constantly praised as an exceptional communicator and orator, renowned for delivering powerful monologues and speaking his mind—often and at length.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt appears that Modi has lost the ability to engage in unscripted conversations. He has grown out of practice, and whenever he is compelled to do so, it appears awkward and contrived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe followers have been so effectively influenced that they seem to have forgotten a fundamental aspect of a functioning democracy: elected leaders are subject to scrutiny for every action they take. They are expected to provide satisfactory answers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen a system is intentionally designed to be opaque, and when opacity is portrayed as a desirable feature rather than a flaw, it should come as no surprise that a single tough question from a foreign journalist would trigger chaos among his supporters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo put it simply: they panicked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \\[This was a tweet made by Meghnad\\]([https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/1673902262794715136?t=\\_zeGZ9vFJedJyTO332XfKg&s=19](https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/1673902262794715136?t=_zeGZ9vFJedJyTO332XfKg&s=19)) ",

        "Authoritarian regimes are good at indoctrinating the public slowly over time to support them, even when the situation is against them. Usually these same people don't believe they are living under an authoritarian regime because their experience or lack of memory of not living under one for some time clouds their judgement, any attempt to enlighten them is usually met with disdain.\n\nModi isn't exactly Putin or Xi Jinping.. not even anywhere close.. but he's still on the spectrum. I would put him on a similar level as Erdogan in Turkey probably, the west secretly wishes he wasn't in power (Turkey) and in NATO but nonetheless tolerate him begrudgingly despite his country's democratic backsliding over the last decade because otherwise he would almost certainly be a Putin puppet closer to Western Europe.\n\nThe west knows that if it pushes too far and criticizes India's governing regime too much then they will move closer to Russia which they (India) see as a good partner given their history, so they secretly probably wish Modi was not in power and make a criticism here and there but are careful not to push too much.",
        "> The followers have been so effectively influenced that they seem to have forgotten a fundamental aspect of a functioning democracy\n\nBhakts and godi journos haven't forgotten the principle. They relentlessly question opposition leaders, foreign leaders who're critical, protesting farmers/wrestlers on media and social media.\n\nThey want special treatment and immunity from accountability only for their samrat and his sub-samrats.",

The fact that an expected softball question was fumbled and the Prime Vegetable Gobhi seemed like a 2-bit brain-dead apparatchik descending into defensive posturing and his minions attempting a whataboutist rebuttal, post-fumble, was tragicomedy at its lowest. It just laid bare the sycophancy surrounding a psychopathic 'leader' of dubious intellect.\n\nWatching their Gobhi looking like the vegetable just hurt the thin-skinned followers - the potatoes. \n\nEdit: Words",

        "This reminds me of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Atal was in no way better than Modi once you get past the propaganda about him.\n\nI remember just how utterly poor his communication used to be in the parliament or in press conferences. The dude was actually made fun off on TV for how utterly dull his speech was. \n\nThat however did not matter at all to his fans. He was called a great poet, a great orator blah blah... The truth here is exactly the truth about Modi:\n\nMost people simply agree with their hindu-fascist work. They rejoice in minorities being oppressed and their own insecurities being buffeted.

Modi and the BJP regularly use DoubleSpeak, so Apparatchik perfectly fits.\n\nTragicomedy? Syncophancy? Whataboutist? Psychopathic?

As a huge admirer of your work, I greatly appreciate what you do. While we, in this community, often criticize the government under the protective veil of anonymity, you fearlessly voice your opinions on Twitter without concern for a government that is always eager to punish dissenting voices. That takes a lot of courage.\n\nMy intention was to amplify the reach of your tweet and ensure it reaches a broader audience. However, due to the platform's regulations, which prohibit sharing screenshots from social media platforms, I resorted to copying and pasting your tweet instead. Regrettably, I failed to provide the proper attribution by linking you as the source, and for that, I have no valid excuse. I genuinely apologize for this.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to emphasize that accumulating Reddit karma holds relatively low significance for me. I feel compelled to share that this is actually my fifth Reddit account, as my previous accounts were permanently banned for disregarding the ban imposed on participating in another subreddit (the other one). The present subreddit we are engaging in happens to be the only place for me where I can freely express my critiques of the government without being relentlessly pursued by its bhakts. I mention these details to assure you that my intention was not to engage in karma farming.",

        "it's alright good sir. As I said, I appreciate you spreading the message. You edited the post and gave attribution so all good!\n\n(But just out of curiosity, did you use chatgpt to draft this response? Again, no judgment, just curious)",
        "Since I'm apologising I did put in more effort than I usually do for a reddit comment.\n\nActually, if you examine this particular post, you will notice that I did not simply copy and paste your tweet word-for-word either.\n\nMay I ask the reason behind your assumption that I utilized chatgpt to compose this apology?",

The voice of the centrists just gets drowned out.\n\nI mean, look at your post. It is as biased as it gets and just represents political rhetoric and jingoism as much as the bhakts you're complaining.about.\n\nFor what it is worth, my non political POV here is that there is a time and place for certain questions. Modi came to America for economic and state level diplomacy. Questions should focus on that. Say if Biden was visiting India to promote US-India partnership and he got asked questions about kids being killed in US schools due to shootings, that too would be an inappropriate question.",

My point was, I rarely see any post that's balanced and fair to both sides. What I end up seeing is a statement that's over hyped on one side and using jingoism for the other side",
        ">His ardent supporters have been indoctrinated to believe that the PM is not answerable to anyone for his actions. They are content with his scripted interviews and speeches, considering them sufficient.

Someone who is constantly criticising the Government for things they are doing wrong and demanding improvements. If the government fulfills your demands in a reasonable ammount of time, you vote for them again. If they don't listen to you, You vote them out.\n\nThis blind worshipping of those in power is idiotic at best and downright dengerous for a democratic nation. Its a slippery slope that leads directly to the gates of Authoritarianism.",

        "Bruh that's literally the one unscripted interview he's given in 2 terms. I do not understand why indians, meaning avg conservatives are not questioning that. I mean.... Come on. \n\nThat's 2 terms, around 10 years...... Without a single press conference. What a loser.",
        "Reporter was focused on only one minority, which is a huge disservice considering what is happening in Manipur\n\nA literal civil war",
        "Instead of resorting to baseless accusations, why not utilize a bot to create a similarly worded apology to mine and prove that you're right? Mind you, bot-generated messages often lack a personal touch, so the apology should strive to be direct and personalized like mine.",
        "A person in public service who can't even answer a single question as such are basically incompetent!",
        "What accusations did I make? Besides being a little much, it just reads kinda robotic even though it has been written by a human being. That's it. Do as you please with the feedback.",
        "Maybe I overreacted, I felt like you were accusing me of using a bot to draft the comment.",

        "And yet Mudikaka flopped the answer. He was like a bird squawking and trying to scare away a predator by flapping its wings vigorously. Pooped royally on a big stage. That's why practicing with smaller pressconfs in India would have been a good idea. Serves him right.",

Modi isn't exactly Putin or Xi Jinping.. not even anywhere close.. but he's still on the spectrum. I would put him on a similar level as Erdogan in Turkey probably, the west secretly wishes he wasn't in power (Turkey) and in NATO but nonetheless tolerate him begrudgingly despite his country's democratic backsliding over the last decade because otherwise he would almost certainly be a Putin puppet closer to Western Europe. The west knows that if it pushes too far and criticizes India's governing regime too much then they will move closer to Russia which they (India) see as a good partner given their history, so they secretly probably wish Modi was not in power and make a criticism here and there but are careful not to push too much. > The followers have been so effectively influenced that they seem to have forgotten a fundamental aspect of a functioning democracy Bhakts and godi journos haven't forgotten the principle. They relentlessly question opposition leaders, foreign leaders who're critical, protesting farmers/wrestlers on media and social media. They want special treatment and immunity from accountability only for their samrat and his sub-samrats. Modi was never good at unscripted interactions. Including his time as CM. He is deliberately protected from potential embarrassment. Arre Meghnad, you here?! Dosti bani rahe He is considered as a god by his supporters and there’s no culture of questioning elders let alone „gods“ in India. Truly moving backwards I'm actually surprised that his disciples took this route, rather than put up edited videos on YouTube with titles like \"MODI SAVAGELY RIPS APART MUSLIM WSJ LIBERAL REPORTER: WATCH\" It wasn't even a tough question. It was expected and the simple answer would have been to deny it as misplaced perception. The fact that an expected softball question was fumbled and the Prime Vegetable Gobhi seemed like a 2-bit brain-dead apparatchik descending into defensive posturing and his minions attempting a whataboutist rebuttal, post-fumble, was tragicomedy at its lowest. It just laid bare the sycophancy surrounding a psychopathic 'leader' of dubious intellect. Watching their Gobhi looking like the vegetable just hurt the thin-skinned followers - the potatoes. Edit: Words I think I follow your Twitter account. Yes we are Now rubbing stones for Fire. did you expect extra marks for vocabulary? I didnt understand why the reporter asked a generic question. IMO listing the names of lynched muslims and the lack of justice would have been a hard hitting question that would have been difficult to sidestep The problem is the PM has been used to being Kiddy treatment for 9 years ,in India it's how do u eat 🥭 nd aap sote kaise ho .Bhakts response was pretty much expected they probably expected similar questions 🙄 nd well the emperor stood Naked nd exposed .. This reminds me of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Atal was in no way better than Modi once you get past the propaganda about him. I remember just how utterly poor his communication used to be in the parliament or in press conferences. The dude was actually made fun off on TV for how utterly dull his speech was. That however did not matter at all to his fans. He was called a great poet, a great orator blah blah... The truth here is exactly the truth about Modi: Most people simply agree with their hindu-fascist work. They rejoice in minorities being oppressed and their own insecurities being buffeted. Modi, Atal, Trump... these are all nothing but manifestations of the regular joe's impotence. Investigate girl child! Immediately. Because that was the only question approved. Tough question? A vague, pre planned, planted question with multiple possible escapes. WSJ? Disciples??? Gangadhar he shaktimaan hai. I'm not sure if you're the same person as the original twitter user or not but this is the original source of this text: [https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/1673902262794715136?s=20](https://twitter.com/Memeghnad/status/1673902262794715136?s=20) Yeah \"tough\" is relative. To Dear Leader accustomed to only fawning interviews about his preference in mangoes, this was a tough question. Are Meghnad jee, aayiye aayiye... Do you think your comment added anything of value to the conversation? Why did you feel it was necessary to react to a fairly well written paragraph of text? Were there some big words you didn't understand? If you understood everything, what is your exact issue? People like you are why we can't have nice things. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ It all started with the Karan Thapar interview, after that he hasn't given an unscripted interview. The ironical part is that that question itself was scripted and still there is so much hue and cry. Mental. That was a beautifully clever comment but tum jaise logo ki jealousy hi khatam nahi hoti. Rehne do, inse nahi ho payega... Compared to Modi, ABV was a better poet, a better orator and a better politician, who understood some of the core democratic values. I believe, its all a fugazi. The way things work, There is someone else pulling the strings. No concrete past records. Everything opaque. Not a single open public conversation. If they say MMS a puppet, then this one is bigger one and ... worse. What a shame, really. Took one question in 9 years, and botched up that too. The reporter who asked the question was trolled so much that White House had to issue a statement. What tough question? Nobody asked him about Adani (the main reason why Gautam bhai didnt get to travel for free with his SO) The issue is that 2 questions simply does not do justice to the 9 years of good/bad governance, whichever side you’re on. I just wish the two journalists, just to prove a point, asked him how he gets the tremendous energy to work 18 hours a day. It rhetoric would have been better.. Beautifully clever comment my ass, extensively verbose over explaining comments with vocabulary that isnt much commonly used does not make it funny. Whole point of language was to make communication as efficient it can, and to deliver the information needed to be conveyed in as few words as possible. Big words i didnt understand? none of the words used by him/her will ever be used in higher academia literature, its a mixture of words that arent used as often to somehow make his hollow joke more funny and you mfs fall for it. \"do you think my comment added anything of value to the conversation?\" no. because that is exactly what i'm pointing out, excessive vocabulary and over complicating fairly simple coherent sentences does not make it funny you're literally being hypocritical of the above comment That's Meghnad, former newslaundry journalist, I think he would've made it clear in his username if he was the one that posted this \"none of the words used by him/her will ever be used in higher academia literature...words that arent used as often\" **Which words** *are you even talking about?* **Apparatchik?** It's used a LOT in news articles, particularly because of the current Russia-Ukraine war. **Go ahead.** Just Google the word, tap the \"News\" tab, and you'll see that the first page contains articles that use this word, all between 2-4 weeks old. Modi and the BJP regularly use DoubleSpeak, so Apparatchik perfectly fits. Tragicomedy? Syncophancy? Whataboutist? Psychopathic? ALL of these are commonly used words when you're talking about a \"strong man\" dictator like Putin, Erdogan, or our very own Dear Leader. So please. **Back up your claim.** Which words did he use that are so rarely used, so unnecessary? Perhaps, and work with me here, perhaps these words just don't appear in the bargain basement articles YOU read? It's not. Because this is me. OP posted my tweet here verbatim without giving credit. :) Hi OP, I appreciate you sharing my thoughts here. It helps reach more people. But if you have to copy paste stuff from Twitter then please give due credit. It's common courtesy even if you want to karma farm. Thanks! And yet you used ***two whole paragraphs*** / two long sentences, when all you needed to say was \"Big Words, Head Hurts, Tor ANNGGRYYY\". We get it. OR you could have been inspired by Kevin and said “Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?” Maybe YOU should follow your own advice. Friendo. Hello, fellow lurker! It's a bit weird to know the individual identity of users on reddit. Come on now. Saying Tough questions is a stretch. Hello back sir! I did not read the news yet. What did she ask? Lol wtf, shame on ya, OP I missed the brouhaha. Where is the summary? If I am indeed addressing Meghnad, I would like to begin by offering my sincerest apologies for not acknowledging you as the original author of the tweet I shared here. As a huge admirer of your work, I greatly appreciate what you do. While we, in this community, often criticize the government under the protective veil of anonymity, you fearlessly voice your opinions on Twitter without concern for a government that is always eager to punish dissenting voices. That takes a lot of courage. My intention was to amplify the reach of your tweet and ensure it reaches a broader audience. However, due to the platform's regulations, which prohibit sharing screenshots from social media platforms, I resorted to copying and pasting your tweet instead. Regrettably, I failed to provide the proper attribution by linking you as the source, and for that, I have no valid excuse. I genuinely apologize for this. Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that accumulating Reddit karma holds relatively low significance for me. I feel compelled to share that this is actually my fifth Reddit account, as my previous accounts were permanently banned for disregarding the ban imposed on participating in another subreddit (the other one). The present subreddit we are engaging in happens to be the only place for me where I can freely express my critiques of the government without being relentlessly pursued by its bhakts. I mention these details to assure you that my intention was not to engage in karma farming. ab itna chatne se kuchh nahi hoga, kahaniyan jitni bana lo intention tumhara kabhi bhi original ko credit dene ka tha hi nahi jab tak pakde nahi gayi it's alright good sir. As I said, I appreciate you spreading the message. You edited the post and gave attribution so all good! (But just out of curiosity, did you use chatgpt to draft this response? Again, no judgment, just curious) Since I'm apologising I did put in more effort than I usually do for a reddit comment. Actually, if you examine this particular post, you will notice that I did not simply copy and paste your tweet word-for-word either. May I ask the reason behind your assumption that I utilized chatgpt to compose this apology? Tu anpadh hain to aab anpadh hai kya? >> The followers have been so effectively influenced that they seem to have forgotten a fundamental aspect of a functioning democracy > >Bhakts and godi journos haven't forgotten the principle.

That's also because the loudest voices are those that occupy the political left and right extremes and are heavily biased. The voice of the centrists just gets drowned out. I mean, look at your post. It is as biased as it gets and just represents political rhetoric and jingoism as much as the bhakts you're complaining.about. For what it is worth, my non political POV here is that there is a time and place for certain questions. Modi came to America for economic and state level diplomacy. Questions should focus on that. Say if Biden was visiting India to promote US-India partnership and he got asked questions about kids being killed in US schools due to shootings, that too would be an inappropriate question. But i didn't give any excuses for not giving him credit. In fact, I explicitly acknowledged that I have no justifications for what I did and sincerely apologized to him. He's Narendra Modi. Not Sadhguru. Ah centrists, one can always rely on them to equate far-right bigots with a left-of-centre progressive! Modi has always fumbled and bungled every interview. And when he does not have an answer he does his famous \"mai-hairaan/hurt-hoon\" bit. Because the comment/apology feels very bot like and unnecessarily over the top. Most people would have gone with a simple, straightforward, \"Post has been updated with the source. Apologies for not having given credit earlier. :)\" >Ah centrists, one can always rely on them to equate far-right bigots with a left-of-centre progressive! You can call yourself whatever you want but I was responding purely to the post I replied to, and how it was worded. Left of center is centrist, by the way. My point was, I rarely see any post that's balanced and fair to both sides. What I end up seeing is a statement that's over hyped on one side and using jingoism for the other side >His ardent supporters have been indoctrinated to believe that the PM is not answerable to anyone for his actions. They are content with his scripted interviews and speeches, considering them sufficient. Blind trust and unconditional faith in his words are expected. Absolutely nails it here. I am still in the early half of my twenties so I am not even that old but even I remember the days when questioning and criticising the Government was the norm and anyone constantly praising the Government was made fun of and called a 'Chamcha'. That should be the default of a normal voter in a democratic country. Someone who is constantly criticising the Government for things they are doing wrong and demanding improvements. If the government fulfills your demands in a reasonable ammount of time, you vote for them again. If they don't listen to you, You vote them out. This blind worshipping of those in power is idiotic at best and downright dengerous for a democratic nation. Its a slippery slope that leads directly to the gates of Authoritarianism. Asking questions helps Modi stay hydrated. Ask a question = gulp. > Modi was never good at unscripted interactions This is another way of saying somebody is an idiot and a liar. They can never reveal their true intentions, so they always need to be prepared. And they can never truly wing it if they need to, because they are stupid. If they were honest but stupid, they would still be able to genuinely respond, even if it came across as unpolished or uncharismatic. Bruh that's literally the one unscripted interview he's given in 2 terms. I do not understand why indians, meaning avg conservatives are not questioning that. I mean.... Come on. That's 2 terms, around 10 years...... Without a single press conference. What a loser. Reporter was focused on only one minority, which is a huge disservice considering what is happening in Manipur A literal civil war Instead of resorting to baseless accusations, why not utilize a bot to create a similarly worded apology to mine and prove that you're right? Mind you, bot-generated messages often lack a personal touch, so the apology should strive to be direct and personalized like mine. A person in public service who can't even answer a single question as such are basically incompetent! What accusations did I make? Besides being a little much, it just reads kinda robotic even though it has been written by a human being. That's it. Do as you please with the feedback. Maybe I overreacted, I felt like you were accusing me of using a bot to draft the comment. I love reddit because of comments like yours Ho payega ko theek hi hoe likhe ho tum :) And yet Mudikaka flopped the answer. He was like a bird squawking and trying to scare away a predator by flapping its wings vigorously. Pooped royally on a big stage. That's why practicing with smaller pressconfs in India would have been a good idea. Serves him right. It's uncle Sam's mistake, should have provided a teleprompter and then the world would have seen the oratory of Mauji ji."
