        "Itâ€™s the regular and not the Pro iPhone models.\n\nThe inclusion of the wording â€˜Effectiveâ€™ pretty much it has to have the following mentioned bank accounts collectively in order to accumulate the total discount mentioned in the newspaper, itâ€™s safe to ask them about it.",
        "What's difference between normal and pro? It says 11k store discount too.",
        "The non-pro version uses last yearâ€™s chip that debuted in the Pro along with last gen tech like the 60Hz display which comes in a cheaper aluminium frame thatâ€™s susceptible to dents if used without a case but otherwise has a better battery if one grabs the larger Plus variant.",
        "That price is including exchange bonus. Theyâ€™ll lowball you hard for your old phone exchange and recover the difference and some.\n\nIncluding exchange cost in discount is the biggest scum tactic in the last few years.",
        "It will be offline. Why not check it out? If the deal doesn't suit you then don't get it.",
        "I am planning to go, but wanted to know other people's experience, even after post-purchase with bajaj electronics.",
        "Are you sure? It doesn't say anything about exchange cost. Only mentions the instant store discount.",
        "Exchange bonus upto 10000 is literally mentioned in the second from right box on top",
        "That must be the down payment or it will be with buy back guarantee",
        "Bruh, didn't notice that... sorry.",
        "What is buy back guarantee? Can I sell it to them later?",
        "Wait, it says additional discount.",
        "Theyâ€™ll just value your phone significantly lower and make back that 10k.\n\nSay for example youâ€™re exchanging an iPhone 11 which is worth 20k. Theyâ€™ll only give you 10k for it and another 10k extra exchange bonus",
        "Yup. After 1 year. But generally those are not the best value for money. You can get way better value at local stores. On top of that iPhone are meant to be used for a long time. There's no point of selling it after 1 year specially when apple not making any improvements at all to the newer ones"
