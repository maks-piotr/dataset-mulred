It‚Äôs not jealousy, it‚Äôs about how someone shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to acquire so much wealth. It‚Äôs not wealth made by correct means. There‚Äôs corruption involved.",
        "1.5-2 crores per person lmao",
        "It‚Äôs all relative. He‚Äôs worth over 100 billion. This cruise wasn‚Äôt even 0.5% of his net worth. An average upper middle class family‚Äôs net worth is around 2 cr. By that logic, if they spend more than 1 lakh for their wedding, it would be an obscene display of wealth. A random wedding in a tier 3 city costs more than that. People love to hate on the rich but don‚Äôt look at what they spend relative to their wealth.",
        "This is just an Italian negotiation tactic. Clearly feigning offense to increase the bribe money. Hedging his bets so that if the offer is not up to his mark then he wins his \"dignity\" but if the price is right he makes a lot of money and sweeps his \"integrity\" under one of his expensive rugs. Either way he wins.",
