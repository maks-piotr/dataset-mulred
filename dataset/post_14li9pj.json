It has to be used for a public purpose.\n\nThe Tatas’ failure is on them. And since the Singur fiasco, they have increased their investments in Bengal. Shifted a lot of their businesses from Orissa and Jharkhand to Bengal. \n\nIt is not necessary to cry over the plant for a failed product 15 years later.",
        "The Singur failure is on the Tatas.\n\nWhy did they want to acquire fertile agricultural land when they had already been handed ample land in Kharagpur? The land acquisition was declared illegal by the Supreme Court itself because it was forcible acquisition of land specifically earmarked for public purposes under the eminent domain provision.\n\nAnd here’s a fact. West Bengal has thrice the population density of Gujarat, with much less land. And after what happened in the 60s and 70s, the Bengali worker class would rather farm than work in a factory owned by a western state businessman- especially when these factories were once owned and closed down without notice by businessmen from those states.\n\nEdit: for the people who are downvoting this \n\nhttps://www.livemint.com/Opinion/L9q3NE4Ivo9hAKmAZx7OeL/Singur-The-judgement-and-the-backstory.html",

        "This article doesn't say Tata's \"took\" the land in Singur. At the end of the day, the company is not in any position to force people to give them the land. That can be done only by the Government. It was the Government that tried to forcibly buy the land from the farmers by, and I now quote your own article:\n\n> At Singur, Marxist cadres strong-armed land acquisition—with threats, beatings, molestation, rape and killing.  \n\nThe Tatas did not do this. It was the Government and the political party leading the Government who did this.",
        ">And here’s a fact. West Bengal has thrice the population density of Gujarat, with much less land. And after what happened in the 60s and 70s, the Bengali worker class would rather farm than work in a factory owned by a western state businessman- especially when these factories were once owned and closed down without notice by businessmen from those states.\n\nThe industrial units in West Bengal were closed down in 60s and 70s not because the Businessmen enjoyed closing them down but because they were forced to do so by the Communists! The Communists wanted to wage a class warfare on the businessmen and stop \"exploitation\" of the labour. They succeeded. No factories = no exploitation. Have fun farming. And stop complaining about factories opening in other states after you chased them away from yours.",
        "The company insisted on the Singur land even after being offered a definitive plot in Kharagpur. \n\nGiven the Tatas’ involvement with the 2G scam, their gradual monopolisation of Indian aviation and the ongoing TCS recruitment scam, I won’t rule out measures taken by them to acquire this land.\n\nTheir official reasoning was- they needed land close to an airport. Why? Why not build it in an area where you already have numerous manufacturing interests?",
        "Yes... so stop complaining about Gujarat getting these factories. Please look after your own citizens first like Rajasthan is by overloading its public finances by switching to OPS.",

Connectivity to those industrial land with highways (the Mumbai-Delhi Transport Corridor goes through Gujarat) and Ports which are connected to the Arabian Sea and so are good for exporting stuff to Middle East, Africa and Europe)\n3. Excellent and uninterrupted power supply (which is kind of important)\n4. A vast talent pool of skilled labour\n5. A network of vendors which can act as supply chain partners\n6. A stable and business friendly state government.\n\nWhich other state in India can really offer all of this?",
        "They ran away when the Freight Equalisation Policy gave them an out. They needed the mineral resources, not the manpower.\n\nAnd you talk of class warfare. What class do you think we belong to?",
        "Pensions are a necessary evil at this point.\n\nThough it is ineffective at this point.",
        "Bhai, the government is choosing to spend its resources which is generated from the taxpayers of entire state on a very slim minority of state officials. It is the duty and responsibility of each and every working individual to make arrangements for their own retirement. It is not the duty of taxpaying citizens of a state to fund the retirement of state government employees.",
        "That’s what I meant by “ineffective”. It doesn’t work.\n\nBut if you take it away, the government officials will start taking in more and more bribes. Even the very very slim majority of honest ones.",
        ">They needed the mineral resources, not the manpower.\n\nThey needed connectivity to ports and access to markets. Calcutta had both. Freight equalization policy had an impact on states like Rajasthan, Bihar, Orissa, MP and UP. It did not have impact on West Bengal which, with Calcutta, had all advantages of Bombay except for Communists who actively decided to drive away businesses from the state.\n\nAt the time of Independence, Calcutta was the *biggest* city in India and the second most important City in entire British Empire after London. It had tremendous advantages which it managed to fritter away due to its own incompetence.",
        "The communists came in much later.\n\nThey mostly fought against the Congress government for land rights of the rural population. \n\nThe Freight Equalisation policy gave them exactly what they needed. Mineral resources could be transported across the country at near zero cost. And West Bengal had a lot of coal and a lot of water.\n\nTo businessmen, labour rights are pesky distractions.",
        "I think it was closes to a Port rather than Airport. And the reason for that was that it is easier to then ship cars. In either case, it was the Government who then tried to run a campaign of intimidation against the farmers to acquire the land, not Tata.\n\nTata was quite happy to move to Gujarat after that who gave them what they were looking for in terms of infrastructure and connectivity.",
        "Kharagpur is much nearer to Haldia port. Kolkata port was not suited for export back then due to space issues.\n\nThe government ran the campaign because they wanted the money to fill their own pockets. \n\nAt the end of the day, there is no justification for leaving an area with a heavy engineering ecosystem for a agricultural plot, which happens to cultivate most of the food we eat in the adjoining districts.",
        ">To businessmen, labour rights are pesky distractions.\n\nSo then why complain about industry going elsewhere? If there are no factories then there are no labour law violations by those pesky industrialists. Enjoy. You got what you wanted.",

So, it's pretty much a ideal place to invest (only for a big player) where you can make as much pollution as you want, can get permission to build over restricted places and not even pass that buck from the excess profit to the employees. (P.S: It's still not recieving enough FDI compared to other states who they are very hell bent on turning irrelevant ) What the Tatas did was illegal. They were given ample land in an area with an existing heavy engineering ecosystem and yet chose to forcibly acquire fertile agricultural land, which would have disrupted the agricultural supply chain for a lot of Bengal. You cannot acquire land using eminent domain provision and use it for private purposes. It has to be used for a public purpose. The Tatas’ failure is on them. And since the Singur fiasco, they have increased their investments in Bengal. Shifted a lot of their businesses from Orissa and Jharkhand to Bengal. It is not necessary to cry over the plant for a failed product 15 years later. The Singur failure is on the Tatas. Why did they want to acquire fertile agricultural land when they had already been handed ample land in Kharagpur? The land acquisition was declared illegal by the Supreme Court itself because it was forcible acquisition of land specifically earmarked for public purposes under the eminent domain provision. And here’s a fact. West Bengal has thrice the population density of Gujarat, with much less land. And after what happened in the 60s and 70s, the Bengali worker class would rather farm than work in a factory owned by a western state businessman- especially when these factories were once owned and closed down without notice by businessmen from those states. Edit: for the people who are downvoting this Availability of land. Gujarat has very less arable land compared to a lot of states in the East and South. Bihar seriously? Tata did not acquire land, it was acquired by the state govt. State govt demarcates it for industrial use, builds basic infra and then hands it over to a company. What Tata did was nothing illegal. They bought the land. They are equally culpable. They were offered ample land in Kharagpur, where they already have significant investments. Why be fixated on premium agricultural land? Tatas had asked for land in Kharagpur, but they were offered in Singur. By that yardstick Rajasthan and Ladakh should have been miles ahead of Guj. The entire north Mah is arid, yet there is no industry there, I wonder why they chose fertile tracts of west Maharashtra? The land requirement of the industry is very low. The key issue is infrastructure and support from bureaucracy. In that race Guj has taken a significant lead. No they had been offered land in Kharagpur, they took the land in Singur. References please. Rajasthan has a lot of mineral based industries. Ladakh is a geopolitical issue for industries. And not every state can keep giving you subsidies and cheap land. There is no geopolitical issue in ladakh anymore. Rajasthan has 31% unemployment rate, speaks volumes of it's industrial base. Gujrat is not giving subsidized land, Guj is offering infrastructure, i.e. minimal time to start operations which every businessman looks forward to. Not every state can do that. We have our own citizens to take care of first, not cater to the whims of outsider industrialists. Anything that makes you sleep at night. Joke of the day 🤣🤣 Keep joking all you want. When they leave, it is left to us to pick up the pieces. Multiple companies like them have entered and exited India. Please don't cross the road, otherwise someone else would be left collecting your pieces. Not the same thing. If I cross the road without checking for traffic, my family will be left to pick up pieces of me. It won’t affect anyone else. But mistakes of this scale will cost millions. You can justify breaking enough eggs to make omelettes, but not everyone shares your ruthlessness. The Bengal government gave the Adanis the green signal to build a port a year back. Now they are refusing to build it until they are given licenses to mine coal from tribal areas. Bruh Gujarat was good place for industry even before 2014! Gift city was ingurated in 2007! 7 years before PM! People here really lack knowledge and just blame and act like Bhakt This article doesn't say Tata's \"took\" the land in Singur. At the end of the day, the company is not in any position to force people to give them the land. That can be done only by the Government. It was the Government that tried to forcibly buy the land from the farmers by, and I now quote your own article: > At Singur, Marxist cadres strong-armed land acquisition—with threats, beatings, molestation, rape and killing. The Tatas did not do this. It was the Government and the political party leading the Government who did this. >And here’s a fact. West Bengal has thrice the population density of Gujarat, with much less land. And after what happened in the 60s and 70s, the Bengali worker class would rather farm than work in a factory owned by a western state businessman- especially when these factories were once owned and closed down without notice by businessmen from those states. The industrial units in West Bengal were closed down in 60s and 70s not because the Businessmen enjoyed closing them down but because they were forced to do so by the Communists! The Communists wanted to wage a class warfare on the businessmen and stop \"exploitation\" of the labour. They succeeded. No factories = no exploitation. Have fun farming. And stop complaining about factories opening in other states after you chased them away from yours. The company insisted on the Singur land even after being offered a definitive plot in Kharagpur. Given the Tatas’ involvement with the 2G scam, their gradual monopolisation of Indian aviation and the ongoing TCS recruitment scam, I won’t rule out measures taken by them to acquire this land. Their official reasoning was- they needed land close to an airport. Why? Why not build it in an area where you already have numerous manufacturing interests? Yes... so stop complaining about Gujarat getting these factories. Please look after your own citizens first like Rajasthan is by overloading its public finances by switching to OPS. P&G has been in the country since 1964 btw. And India is one of the largest markets for P&G, it is unlikely to ever leave the country. Gujarat offers companies: 1. Ample amount of industrial land 2. Connectivity to those industrial land with highways (the Mumbai-Delhi Transport Corridor goes through Gujarat) and Ports which are connected to the Arabian Sea and so are good for exporting stuff to Middle East, Africa and Europe) 3. Excellent and uninterrupted power supply (which is kind of important) 4. A vast talent pool of skilled labour 5. A network of vendors which can act as supply chain partners 6. A stable and business friendly state government. Which other state in India can really offer all of this? They ran away when the Freight Equalisation Policy gave them an out. They needed the mineral resources, not the manpower. And you talk of class warfare. What class do you think we belong to? Pensions are a necessary evil at this point. Though it is ineffective at this point. Bhai, the government is choosing to spend its resources which is generated from the taxpayers of entire state on a very slim minority of state officials. It is the duty and responsibility of each and every working individual to make arrangements for their own retirement. It is not the duty of taxpaying citizens of a state to fund the retirement of state government employees. That’s what I meant by “ineffective”. It doesn’t work. But if you take it away, the government officials will start taking in more and more bribes. Even the very very slim majority of honest ones. >They needed the mineral resources, not the manpower. They needed connectivity to ports and access to markets. Calcutta had both. Freight equalization policy had an impact on states like Rajasthan, Bihar, Orissa, MP and UP. It did not have impact on West Bengal which, with Calcutta, had all advantages of Bombay except for Communists who actively decided to drive away businesses from the state. At the time of Independence, Calcutta was the *biggest* city in India and the second most important City in entire British Empire after London. It had tremendous advantages which it managed to fritter away due to its own incompetence. The communists came in much later. They mostly fought against the Congress government for land rights of the rural population. The Freight Equalisation policy gave them exactly what they needed. Mineral resources could be transported across the country at near zero cost. And West Bengal had a lot of coal and a lot of water. To businessmen, labour rights are pesky distractions. I think it was closes to a Port rather than Airport. And the reason for that was that it is easier to then ship cars. In either case, it was the Government who then tried to run a campaign of intimidation against the farmers to acquire the land, not Tata. Tata was quite happy to move to Gujarat after that who gave them what they were looking for in terms of infrastructure and connectivity. Kharagpur is much nearer to Haldia port. Kolkata port was not suited for export back then due to space issues. The government ran the campaign because they wanted the money to fill their own pockets. At the end of the day, there is no justification for leaving an area with a heavy engineering ecosystem for a agricultural plot, which happens to cultivate most of the food we eat in the adjoining districts. >To businessmen, labour rights are pesky distractions. So then why complain about industry going elsewhere? If there are no factories then there are no labour law violations by those pesky industrialists. Enjoy. You got what you wanted. Fire the government officials who take bribes at first offence. So it seems there are only extreme options then. Hooray for us. We have successfully become the US on steroids. Welcome to empty government offices. Ratan Tata's company has also bought the most electoral bonds out of anyone else lmao. Stop cucking for that freeloader company Yeah right!! These are all 2022 articles and vids. And they've explained reasons. Whatever investment these places are getting it's only because modi is the pm. Maharashtra can thank Popat Sena's Shinde that the BJP created from the Shiv Sena. LOL. These projects don't get materialised in a day, it is an investment for decades. Google is investing ~$10 billion in GIFT city and Vedanta is bringing ~$20 billion to Dholera. Google and any investor will not bring that money to India unless someone there is credibility, Modi cannot force outside investors to invest in India. That is his achievement that he got investments on his credibility."
