        "It's not really fixable when you hear everyone is going to back to their home villages and must vote for a certain person else their houses would be burnt. Democracy is a joke in WB.",
        "It cannot be fixed because it is not a political issue.\n\nIt is a legal issue- the ownership of land.",
        "Nopes. It's a law and order situation.",
        "Please kick out mamta from here,she's a literal dictator",
        "Yeah, I guess. Surprisingly this joke never gets old.",
        "Where is the BBC documentary on Didi? Dogalapan of British Bastard Cunts.",
        "Why will the police care if two people want to kill each other over farm land? They have their own families to care about- it is a job to them, public service is a very very distant second.\n\nAlso what will the state machinery do? Intervene in private disputes over land? It legally cannot do that. \n\nAs long land ownership disputes keep getting rotated before several courts this will happen. Go to any court or a BDO office in a rural or semi-rural area. 98% of the filed complaints there are about land disputes. \n\nOne of the most well known hotbeds of political violence is Bhangor- a village to the east of Kolkata. Full of bheris (fish farming lakes) and fertile agricultural land. Untaxed agricultural incoming worth crores. They practically supply all the fish and vegetables to Kolkata. Imagine what you can gain even if you get a little more agricultural land than your competing farmer.",
        "But link is of Times of India",
        "It's waste bengol... üóëÔ∏è",
        "It is the responsibility of the police to ensure people don't kill each other. People should be afraid of law and consequences, and it's the responsibility of police to instill that fear.  I'm quite surprised when you say what the police will do for a crime. If that analogy is applied here, it can be applied in any crime. What will police do if someone wants to kill/rape/spy/loot/arson/XYZ?",
        "Haven‚Äôt seen any news from TOI on front page yet. Curious why media has gone radio silent when they should be blazing it all day",
        "Go to anand baazar for local news then , you can probably find videos of ballot boxes being stolen as well .",
        "The left fcuked up Manipur. But I get it that BJP doesn‚Äôt get a pass, because they are currently in power and they do need to fix it the best they can.\n\nMaybe they are. Maybe they aren‚Äôt. I do hate the lack of spotlight on Manipur though.",
        "The news reporters got beaten and their gear broken. The Local Bengali news channels did cover a lot initially but then most of the footage have been restricted from being published by the Government in power. So the print media probably didn't even get a chance to print it.",
        "This sucks. I feel sorry for Bengal, but they asked for it.",
        "It's not like CPIM was any different. The current regime is doing exactly the same thing like the regime which was there before albeit in a larger scale and are probably more brutal. Bengalis voted for a change in 2011 but it was a change for the worse unfortunately.",
        "Mamta is Modi but center left.",
        "Isn't democracy a joke pan India?",
        "Not needed, Indian Media itself is reporting it.",
        "I hear you. It takes scumbags to beat scumbags, which is what TMC did to the commies. But they kept on pressing with their brutal regime, which is what we see today. \n\nNot all bongs may vote for TMC, but that doesn‚Äôt matter when TMC can print it‚Äôs own votes.",
        "Yup. WB is just the flagship.",
        "Hey moron. Do some research first. Majority of people killed were TMC (Mamta's party) workers. They were clearly targeted by BJP and CPI(m) goons.",
        "Had it happened in Punjab, by now genocidal threats against Sikhs would have been trending.",

        "What's the scale of them happening? 16 dead in a single day for what?? Elections? Come on dude.",
        "From what I have been seeing the people who work in the village always tell us that they must go back to vote and they have to vote for the specific party else there will be dire consequences.",
        "Thats quite an unfair comparison. If there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs happened right is legitimate election and seamless transfer of power when BJP lost. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get very hostile if any state legacy party comes close to losing to BJP like TN, Kerala, WB etc.",
        "Did the left fuck it up? Last I heard it was from BJP giving scheduled caste status to the majority, financially-powerful majority ethnic group.",
        "Probably people pissed at BJP‚Äôs inaction, and think I‚Äôm a party supporter.\n\nI‚Äôm not lol. I appreciate the good work that‚Äôs happened under Modi, but the lack of comm on Manipur does piss me off.",
        "Meities are around 50% of the population yes, but they are forced to live in barely 10% of the entire land available in Manipur. I can understand their plight, and totally stand by the judgement of the courts.",
        " what unfair comparison? I compared one facist to another facist. Two evils we must get rid of. The comment was about dictatorship.",
        "Yep I feel the same, the government should be criticised when then show their incompetence and should be praised for their good work. I don't see the latter happening in these times and I don't know what has happened to people? They oppose each and every step we as a nation take, let's see where we go from here :).",
        "Imperfect? yes. A joke? Nope.\nOne must want to eliminate other candidates through votes not violence.",
        "Didi didi didi‚Ä¶.. jai Mamta didi‚Ä¶. \nEverything happening coz of Modi‚Ä¶ look he‚Äôs not even sparing France‚Ä¶.",
        "TN? do you have any idea about TN or you just spew out whatever nonsense RSS feeds you with? TN is the most peaceful state in india with negligible or zero instances of rioting, arson, postpoll violence etc. And we don't lynch people for their dietary choices like you cow belt walas do",
        "Manipur situation is even worse than this",
        "The real fascism",
        "Precisely! It‚Äôs all about conversations. Just because you like something doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt criticise the other.\n\nBJP needs to grow a spine ASAP.",
        "Nothing.\n\nIs there any enforceable law compelling the police to act in public interest?\n\nAnd in these circumstances, why will the police get involved in such disputes? Especially when you can get seriously maimed or killed by a stray bullet or an errant brick. It is a job so that they can take care of their families.\n\nI can see a lot of people downvoting these comments. Shows how far many are detached from reality. You can go on making statements about the ‚Äúshould‚Äù-s and ‚Äúmust‚Äù-s. I am saying what ‚Äúis‚Äù. You can reach out to any government employee or a police officer and ask.",
        "Lol why are you comparing TN with Kerala or WB? We are safer than any state in terms of poll conduct to the extent that I think we are becoming a police state. Please don‚Äôt form your narratives based on propaganda.",

        "Bengal people are actually okay because they don‚Äôt want BJP it seems",
        "I'm a Bengali, and yes, shit is crazy in Bengal. In cities like Kolkata, where I live, there's no problem, but in rural areas, TMC workers go into the polling booth to trouble the voters, and police/CRPF/Election Official, does shit to stop that. When other parties try that, they are killed.\n\nTMC IS THE PROBLEM, because these issues never happen in other places in the country, let it be BJP/Congress/CPMI ruled states. Yes, Mamata Banerjee is the problem.",
        "crimes of the BJP party cannot wash away the atrocities committed by Mamta and her party leaders. If your ideology makes you blind to the crimes of your favourite leaders/people then it's time to throw such ideology into the dust bin.",
        "It's a loose loose situation. There would have been issues even if they were denied sc status.",
        "Where is Derek O'Brien ?",
        "When did I say that it washes it away? I called her a fascist too but on the other side of the political spectrum.",
        "ü§¢",
        "I gave TN as an example because there are strong regional parties that are currently not threatened by a national-level party in the state. But if and when that happens, it'll only get hostile. TN is also relevant because of State vs Centre conflict forever. So a National Party like BJP entering the state politics with some influence and a chance to turn the tables is going to raise tensions. Of course, I wouldn't compare WB to anything rn.",
        "Party holding power has kept on switching in Kerala and TN every 5 or max 10 years, Not unlike Bengal which held on to CPM for 30+ years and is gonna hold on to TMC for atleast 20 years",

        "Unfair because a dictator would go to any extent to not lose an election even if it comes down to rigging, violence etc.",
        "Both are doing it in their own ways. \n\nMamta is a low intellect - low level thug who retorts to violence to win. \n\nModi loses elections but then just buys MLAs to not really lose. Also, has placed stooges in the Election Commission and in other constitutionally independent posts.",
        "Another bot cell account claiming to be a Bengali from Kolkata lol.",
        "Let it be. These right wing asswipes are totally blind to the daily atrocities being committed across the entire north/central of the country. They only wake up when anything goes down in non-BJP ruled states like WB, Kerela etc.",
        "Ever been to Bengal?TMC people are gundas who terrorize village folks an own big flats in Kolkata,they control everything even school principals are TMC members,WB is buy and large a dictatorship",

Maana at least bit holeu amar naam Srijan bengali naam. \n\n(In English, mostly I stated where I live and my college and where I vote, also, taunted him that my name is Srijan, which is a common Bengali name, unlike his, which sounds like a bot).",
        "Takes a bad person to keep another bad person out. BJP if in power in Bengal will lead to a situation far worse than in Manipur. No one wants that except bhakts",
        "Bot bot bot. Google translate using bots are very common. And why am I responding to a bot lol",
        "Which state or ruling party does not do that??? Once in power, they are all dictators. So stop with this 'only in Bengal ' nonsense. \n\nWtf happens in UP? Ever been to UP? The land of random encounters and bulldozers? How about Gujarat?",
        "Unfortunately, MLAs in and out is constitutionally valid. They tread the line just enough to not to disqualified and again, unfortunately legal. \n\nBy that logic, All prime ministers have been and will always be dictators. Indira Gandhi should top that list with the next 9 being empty. \n\nEC stooge or not, BJP doesn‚Äôt win everywhere. \n\nComing back to the point, it‚Äôs unfair to compare a professional wrestler who fights in the ring vs street fighter who has no rules.",
        "The Left did not fucked up Manipur. During the time of the merger into India, Meiteis denied being ST in the beginning, while the rest of the tribes accepted. (The Vaishanavites) Meiteis of the past look down upon the tribal people, it is more positively liberal now. Tribals were not exposed to modern education as Meiteis and the other citizens did, attention, privileges, and protection were needed to avoid misappropriation of resources by unscrupulous people from the educated section of the society.\n\nMoreover, the privileges need to be revised as most of the tribal populations are not like that of the past, education is fairly provided, and many are civil servants and holding designations. Resources have to be shared among the citizens. So this land revenue and land reform ordinance needs to be looked upon for revision. For that stakeholders (not just politicians, but the civil representatives of the communities) are to be included in this revision. The harmony can be maintained to the maximum if it is gradual process instead of the sudden one immediately before an election.\n\nIt is not just Left, Right also doesn't regulate and re-examine the Yojanas or Acts to check their effectiveness. Both use amendments of Acts and the introduction of Yojana/Schemes as vote magnets. The actual effectiveness comes through the cycle of regularization, re-examination, and revision.\n\nIs India that weak to suppress an ethnic clash in a small state and bring about a resolution? I don't think so. So, why the clash (killing and vandalizing) is ongoing for 2 months now? Is our Govt. ignoring the misery of the Manipuri people?\n\nMarendra Nodi never even speak a word of condolence for the lives lost, which makes people lose hope, the hope for Acche Din.",
        "Indira Gandhi was an egotistical Dictator. Whoever denies that is stupid. Probably the last fair PM we had was Manmohan Singh, and before him, Lal Bahadur Shastri. \n\nAlso Poor analogy. Professional Wrestling is scripted. \n\nMy Comparison was more on the lines of a Crony Capitalist and a Mafia Lord. Both have their own ways to ensure their survivals and power.",
        "Bro I'm from UP(Azamgarh)I live in Kolkata,I don't like Yogi but I will prefer him over Mayawati anyday also Both SP and BJP have done good work in UP in the past decade UP is developing infrastructure.I hate BJP,they are a communal party but doesn't mean Mamta is excused for being anti BJP.\n\nLook at our neighbours in Odisha,Naveen Patnaik has had his own share of corruption cases but do u ever hear about violence against party members?The BJD is a lot cleaner than TMC.Patnaik is not a dictator like Mamta so 'all parties are dictators' is also false \n\nNot to mention if BJP and Congress corruption is a lake then TMC corruption is an ocean, surprising how  they get away with so many scandals by playing the Bengali nationalism card",
        "So congress had nothing to do with this. Cool.",

        "If you think any party can handle this, you are dead wrong.\n\nMost of these clashes are between landowners who are using political parties to settle their grudges and disputes. Often these become generational conflicts. Not saying that the parties are innocent. At this point, it is a mutually toxic relationship.\n\nTMC has barely any influence beyond Greater Kolkata. Most of their leaders are from affluent and posh regions of Kolkata and are upper middle class themselves. Mamata Banerjee had been the MP of one of the richest regions of Kolkata for 27 years. TMC is a means to an end for most of the district leaders beyond Kolkata",
        "Bro...you serious? I don't think...under Modi's order we have seen so many ballot boxes being thrown in the dustbin",
        "Lmao ..get out of Mamta Didi's ass....blind hatred without stats.lollll",

        "Your great-grandfather is not responsible for the death of 6 million Jews during WW II. But if your great-grandfather visited Hitler's parents and told them not to conceive any baby, and warn them that one of their children could be a dictator, 6 million Jews wouldn't have died in Holocaust.\n\nHow exactly is INC responsible and how BJP has a clean chit here? Do you have any basis for your statement or you're saying just because people in youtube comments are saying?",
        "Lemme simplify this for you:\n\nHow many years has Scamgress controlled the Center? And how many of these have they controlled both Manipur and the Center?\n\nNow compare it with the time BJP has been power at the Center.\n\nWhich ends in the very simple question: what has Scamgress ever done for Manipur?",
        "bro rukja documentary hai instagram reels nhi",
        "\n\nWhich scam of INC exactly sparked this particular Manipur issue? You are still eluding my question. My question was; How exactly was INC responsible for this ethnic clash? Please explain with the facts. The corroboration for your claim should not be ambiguous and vague. \n\nI am still waiting for the answer.\n\nEdit: Every political party is corrupted, by the way.",
        ">Which ends in the very simple question: what has Scamgress ever done for Manipur?\n\nINC started this, railway connection a few years before losing their seats in the centre, this project is being carried forward by BJP and taking credits.\n\nIn 2021, INC was in power both center and state. The greater Nagalim movement shook Manipur unrest. It was on the verge of disintegration of the state's territory. The CM called the Indian Army and suppressed the agitation on both sides and peace dialogues were brought in to resolve the issue. He strengthened the unity among the communities. Few lives were lost there but not like hundreds of lives today due to the negligence of Modi.\n\nIn the Naga-Kuki conflict of early 90s, and Kuki-Paite conflict of late 90s, the respective PMs (ABV was one of them) actively involved in bringing peace unlike our great leader who is touring the world while his home is burning.\n\nYeah, INC did not do much but at least they don't run away from their responsibilities.\n\nThe last time Modi visited Manipur was during the last election campaign.",

Why will the police care if two people want to kill each other over farm land? They have their own families to care about- it is a job to them, public service is a very very distant second. Also what will the state machinery do? Intervene in private disputes over land? It legally cannot do that. As long land ownership disputes keep getting rotated before several courts this will happen. Go to any court or a BDO office in a rural or semi-rural area. 98% of the filed complaints there are about land disputes. One of the most well known hotbeds of political violence is Bhangor- a village to the east of Kolkata. Full of bheris (fish farming lakes) and fertile agricultural land. Untaxed agricultural incoming worth crores. They practically supply all the fish and vegetables to Kolkata. Imagine what you can gain even if you get a little more agricultural land than your competing farmer. But link is of Times of India It's waste bengol... üóëÔ∏è It is the responsibility of the police to ensure people don't kill each other. People should be afraid of law and consequences, and it's the responsibility of police to instill that fear. I'm quite surprised when you say what the police will do for a crime. If that analogy is applied here, it can be applied in any crime. What will police do if someone wants to kill/rape/spy/loot/arson/XYZ? Haven‚Äôt seen any news from TOI on front page yet. Curious why media has gone radio silent when they should be blazing it all day Go to anand baazar for local news then , you can probably find videos of ballot boxes being stolen as well . The left fcuked up Manipur. But I get it that BJP doesn‚Äôt get a pass, because they are currently in power and they do need to fix it the best they can. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren‚Äôt. I do hate the lack of spotlight on Manipur though. The news reporters got beaten and their gear broken. The Local Bengali news channels did cover a lot initially but then most of the footage have been restricted from being published by the Government in power. So the print media probably didn't even get a chance to print it. This sucks. I feel sorry for Bengal, but they asked for it. It's not like CPIM was any different. The current regime is doing exactly the same thing like the regime which was there before albeit in a larger scale and are probably more brutal. Bengalis voted for a change in 2011 but it was a change for the worse unfortunately. Mamta is Modi but center left. Isn't democracy a joke pan India? Not needed, Indian Media itself is reporting it. I hear you. It takes scumbags to beat scumbags, which is what TMC did to the commies. But they kept on pressing with their brutal regime, which is what we see today. Not all bongs may vote for TMC, but that doesn‚Äôt matter when TMC can print it‚Äôs own votes. Yup. WB is just the flagship. Hey moron. Do some research first. Majority of people killed were TMC (Mamta's party) workers. They were clearly targeted by BJP and CPI(m) goons. Had it happened in Punjab, by now genocidal threats against Sikhs would have been trending. Haven't seen the scenes happening in WB happening anywhere in India, Mamta's real fascist You haven't? Cow Vigilantism, Attacks on dalits. Literally happens every time before elections. I don't know why are you getting downvoted. What's the scale of them happening? 16 dead in a single day for what?? Elections? Come on dude. From what I have been seeing the people who work in the village always tell us that they must go back to vote and they have to vote for the specific party else there will be dire consequences. Thats quite an unfair comparison. If there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs happened right is legitimate election and seamless transfer of power when BJP lost. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get very hostile if any state legacy party comes close to losing to BJP like TN, Kerala, WB etc. Did the left fuck it up? Last I heard it was from BJP giving scheduled caste status to the majority, financially-powerful majority ethnic group. Probably people pissed at BJP‚Äôs inaction, and think I‚Äôm a party supporter. I‚Äôm not lol. I appreciate the good work that‚Äôs happened under Modi, but the lack of comm on Manipur does piss me off. Meities are around 50% of the population yes, but they are forced to live in barely 10% of the entire land available in Manipur. I can understand their plight, and totally stand by the judgement of the courts. what unfair comparison? I compared one facist to another facist. Two evils we must get rid of. The comment was about dictatorship. Yep I feel the same, the government should be criticised when then show their incompetence and should be praised for their good work. I don't see the latter happening in these times and I don't know what has happened to people? They oppose each and every step we as a nation take, let's see where we go from here :). Imperfect? yes. A joke? Nope. One must want to eliminate other candidates through votes not violence. Didi didi didi‚Ä¶.. jai Mamta didi‚Ä¶. Everything happening coz of Modi‚Ä¶ look he‚Äôs not even sparing France‚Ä¶. TN? do you have any idea about TN or you just spew out whatever nonsense RSS feeds you with? TN is the most peaceful state in india with negligible or zero instances of rioting, arson, postpoll violence etc. And we don't lynch people for their dietary choices like you cow belt walas do Manipur situation is even worse than this The real fascism Precisely! It‚Äôs all about conversations. Just because you like something doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt criticise the other. BJP needs to grow a spine ASAP. Nothing. Is there any enforceable law compelling the police to act in public interest? And in these circumstances, why will the police get involved in such disputes? Especially when you can get seriously maimed or killed by a stray bullet or an errant brick. It is a job so that they can take care of their families. I can see a lot of people downvoting these comments. Shows how far many are detached from reality. You can go on making statements about the ‚Äúshould‚Äù-s and ‚Äúmust‚Äù-s. I am saying what ‚Äúis‚Äù. You can reach out to any government employee or a police officer and ask. Lol why are you comparing TN with Kerala or WB? We are safer than any state in terms of poll conduct to the extent that I think we are becoming a police state. Please don‚Äôt form your narratives based on propaganda. Election aise karwao ki 4¬≤ log ghar wapas hi na jaen. ü§° Bengal people are actually okay because they don‚Äôt want BJP it seems I'm a Bengali, and yes, shit is crazy in Bengal. In cities like Kolkata, where I live, there's no problem, but in rural areas, TMC workers go into the polling booth to trouble the voters, and police/CRPF/Election Official, does shit to stop that. When other parties try that, they are killed. TMC IS THE PROBLEM, because these issues never happen in other places in the country, let it be BJP/Congress/CPMI ruled states. Yes, Mamata Banerjee is the problem. crimes of the BJP party cannot wash away the atrocities committed by Mamta and her party leaders. If your ideology makes you blind to the crimes of your favourite leaders/people then it's time to throw such ideology into the dust bin. It's a loose loose situation. There would have been issues even if they were denied sc status. Where is Derek O'Brien ? When did I say that it washes it away? I called her a fascist too but on the other side of the political spectrum. ü§¢ I gave TN as an example because there are strong regional parties that are currently not threatened by a national-level party in the state. But if and when that happens, it'll only get hostile. TN is also relevant because of State vs Centre conflict forever. So a National Party like BJP entering the state politics with some influence and a chance to turn the tables is going to raise tensions. Of course, I wouldn't compare WB to anything rn. Party holding power has kept on switching in Kerala and TN every 5 or max 10 years, Not unlike Bengal which held on to CPM for 30+ years and is gonna hold on to TMC for atleast 20 years >I gave TN as an example because there are strong regional parties that are currently not threatened by a national-level party in the state. But if and when that happens, it'll only get hostile. TN is also relevant because of State vs Centre conflict forever. So a National Party like BJP entering the state politics with some influence and a chance to turn the tables is going to raise tensions. Of course, I wouldn't compare WB to anything rn. Applies to Kerala too. Kerala has seen BJP political workers get killed. That is fascism against fascism. >I gave TN as an example because there are strong regional parties that are currently not threatened by a national-level party in the state. But if and when that happens, it'll only get hostile. TN is also relevant because of State vs Centre conflict forever. So a National Party like BJP entering the state politics with some influence and a chance to turn the tables is going to raise tensions. Of course, I wouldn't compare WB to anything rn. Here is the intellectual point but sure, suit yourself with name-calling. Unfair because a dictator would go to any extent to not lose an election even if it comes down to rigging, violence etc. Both are doing it in their own ways. Mamta is a low intellect - low level thug who retorts to violence to win. Modi loses elections but then just buys MLAs to not really lose. Also, has placed stooges in the Election Commission and in other constitutionally independent posts. Another bot cell account claiming to be a Bengali from Kolkata lol. Let it be. These right wing asswipes are totally blind to the daily atrocities being committed across the entire north/central of the country. They only wake up when anything goes down in non-BJP ruled states like WB, Kerela etc. Ever been to Bengal?TMC people are gundas who terrorize village folks an own big flats in Kolkata,they control everything even school principals are TMC members,WB is buy and large a dictatorship Aare, aami actually bangali Bhai. Taratala e thaki, Government College of Engineering and Ceramic Technology te pori, Laxmi Bazaar er paashe. Municipal Election e vote u diechilam, Taratala Ward 98 e. Aami bot, but tor naam besi bot er moton. Maana at least bit holeu amar naam Srijan bengali naam. (In English, mostly I stated where I live and my college and where I vote, also, taunted him that my name is Srijan, which is a common Bengali name, unlike his, which sounds like a bot). Takes a bad person to keep another bad person out. BJP if in power in Bengal will lead to a situation far worse than in Manipur. No one wants that except bhakts Bot bot bot. Google translate using bots are very common. And why am I responding to a bot lol Which state or ruling party does not do that??? Once in power, they are all dictators. So stop with this 'only in Bengal ' nonsense. Wtf happens in UP? Ever been to UP? The land of random encounters and bulldozers? How about Gujarat? Unfortunately, MLAs in and out is constitutionally valid. They tread the line just enough to not to disqualified and again, unfortunately legal. By that logic, All prime ministers have been and will always be dictators. Indira Gandhi should top that list with the next 9 being empty. EC stooge or not, BJP doesn‚Äôt win everywhere. Coming back to the point, it‚Äôs unfair to compare a professional wrestler who fights in the ring vs street fighter who has no rules. The Left did not fucked up Manipur. During the time of the merger into India, Meiteis denied being ST in the beginning, while the rest of the tribes accepted. (The Vaishanavites) Meiteis of the past look down upon the tribal people, it is more positively liberal now. Tribals were not exposed to modern education as Meiteis and the other citizens did, attention, privileges, and protection were needed to avoid misappropriation of resources by unscrupulous people from the educated section of the society. Moreover, the privileges need to be revised as most of the tribal populations are not like that of the past, education is fairly provided, and many are civil servants and holding designations. Resources have to be shared among the citizens. So this land revenue and land reform ordinance needs to be looked upon for revision. For that stakeholders (not just politicians, but the civil representatives of the communities) are to be included in this revision. The harmony can be maintained to the maximum if it is gradual process instead of the sudden one immediately before an election. It is not just Left, Right also doesn't regulate and re-examine the Yojanas or Acts to check their effectiveness. Both use amendments of Acts and the introduction of Yojana/Schemes as vote magnets. The actual effectiveness comes through the cycle of regularization, re-examination, and revision. Is India that weak to suppress an ethnic clash in a small state and bring about a resolution? I don't think so. So, why the clash (killing and vandalizing) is ongoing for 2 months now? Is our Govt. ignoring the misery of the Manipuri people? Marendra Nodi never even speak a word of condolence for the lives lost, which makes people lose hope, the hope for Acche Din. Indira Gandhi was an egotistical Dictator. Whoever denies that is stupid. Probably the last fair PM we had was Manmohan Singh, and before him, Lal Bahadur Shastri. Also Poor analogy. Professional Wrestling is scripted. My Comparison was more on the lines of a Crony Capitalist and a Mafia Lord. Both have their own ways to ensure their survivals and power. Bro I'm from UP(Azamgarh)I live in Kolkata,I don't like Yogi but I will prefer him over Mayawati anyday also Both SP and BJP have done good work in UP in the past decade UP is developing infrastructure.I hate BJP,they are a communal party but doesn't mean Mamta is excused for being anti BJP. Look at our neighbours in Odisha,Naveen Patnaik has had his own share of corruption cases but do u ever hear about violence against party members?The BJD is a lot cleaner than TMC.Patnaik is not a dictator like Mamta so 'all parties are dictators' is also false Not to mention if BJP and Congress corruption is a lake then TMC corruption is an ocean, surprising how they get away with so many scandals by playing the Bengali nationalism card So congress had nothing to do with this. Cool. [Didi after the poll results:](https://youtu.be/2g5Hz17C4is) If you think any party can handle this, you are dead wrong. Most of these clashes are between landowners who are using political parties to settle their grudges and disputes. Often these become generational conflicts. Not saying that the parties are innocent. At this point, it is a mutually toxic relationship. TMC has barely any influence beyond Greater Kolkata. Most of their leaders are from affluent and posh regions of Kolkata and are upper middle class themselves. Mamata Banerjee had been the MP of one of the richest regions of Kolkata for 27 years. TMC is a means to an end for most of the district leaders beyond Kolkata Bro...you serious? I don't think...under Modi's order we have seen so many ballot boxes being thrown in the dustbin Lmao ..get out of Mamta Didi's ass....blind hatred without stats.lollll Dumbo... Manipur isn't politically generated...the government has already sent army to stop protests, but the women are blocking the path, and it's done by civilians, here all this killing is ordered by Mamta begum herself Dumb man .. Manipur and this can't be compared... Manipur is a protest...and fight between indigenous people...this is political killing and stealing of ballot boxes directly ordered by Mamta ... Your great-grandfather is not responsible for the death of 6 million Jews during WW II. But if your great-grandfather visited Hitler's parents and told them not to conceive any baby, and warn them that one of their children could be a dictator, 6 million Jews wouldn't have died in Holocaust. How exactly is INC responsible and how BJP has a clean chit here? Do you have any basis for your statement or you're saying just because people in youtube comments are saying? Lemme simplify this for you: How many years has Scamgress controlled the Center? And how many of these have they controlled both Manipur and the Center? Now compare it with the time BJP has been power at the Center. Which ends in the very simple question: what has Scamgress ever done for Manipur? bro rukja documentary hai instagram reels nhi Which scam of INC exactly sparked this particular Manipur issue? You are still eluding my question. My question was; How exactly was INC responsible for this ethnic clash? Please explain with the facts. The corroboration for your claim should not be ambiguous and vague. I am still waiting for the answer. Edit: Every political party is corrupted, by the way. >Which ends in the very simple question: what has Scamgress ever done for Manipur? INC started this, railway connection a few years before losing their seats in the centre, this project is being carried forward by BJP and taking credits. In 2021, INC was in power both center and state. The greater Nagalim movement shook Manipur unrest. It was on the verge of disintegration of the state's territory. The CM called the Indian Army and suppressed the agitation on both sides and peace dialogues were brought in to resolve the issue. He strengthened the unity among the communities. Few lives were lost there but not like hundreds of lives today due to the negligence of Modi. In the Naga-Kuki conflict of early 90s, and Kuki-Paite conflict of late 90s, the respective PMs (ABV was one of them) actively involved in bringing peace unlike our great leader who is touring the world while his home is burning. Yeah, INC did not do much but at least they don't run away from their responsibilities. The last time Modi visited Manipur was during the last election campaign. Tell me where BJP worker got killed in TN. In kerala too its limitied to just Kannur District and is nowhere near the goonda politics of WB or Bihar in the past."
