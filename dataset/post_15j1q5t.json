        "Yeah. It's worrying to select location for college, job, housing, and also in terms of business relationships. \n\nIt's scary world out there. A dude got beaten to death' in middle of Gurgaon, so call millennium city or some shit, just a few kms from my office on Sohna road. \n\nParents are scared, asked me to avoid traveling to work, but company is adamant on WFO.",
        "The family if a close friend of mine lives in Gurgaon. They have the extended families in old Delhi. Once after a dinner together, the aunt from old Delhi packed dinner of left over mutton nihari for them to take back to Gurgaon. The cousins refused because they were scared of they get stopped on a checkpoint and chips see their licence and get to know their name, the mutton could be construed for beef and they could be lynched. These are well to do folks working in MNCs .",
        "No need for license or stopping. Vehicle registration data has been sold by the government. This is already used by mobs.",
        "Genuinely curious question: Why do you/your family continue to stay in Gurgaon (or north India in general)? Have you considered going south if not out of India?",
        "We have a family home in Delhi, so I stay there and commute daily to Gurgaon for work where most of the corporates stay. \n\nI had given up on chance to move to a Gulf country in 2012, as I wanted to work in India and saw good opportunities here, however now I am considering for moving elsewhere.",
        "Yeah. Family used to travel from native place via train and we used to pack food for travel and others in Delhi, we have stopped doing that because of fear of being lynched. We prefer to eat train food or chips now.",
        "Good for you, man. It's never too late and stay safe until then!",
        "Housing is a distance dream if you are from Muslim family. I belong from a Muslim family but I'm an Atheist. Finding a house was traumatizing for me. Once a broker called someone to confirm if they would give the house to a Muslim family and it was on speaker, that guy on the call legit said \"Mulla logo bilkul nai dena, age se koi mulla hoga to sidha mana kar dena\"",
        "Targeted attacks during riots also make me not want to stay in majority areas. First part is crossing the hurdle of getting housing and then all drama with eating habits, religious festivals, and then still fear of your neighbours causing you harm during riots. That's too much.",
        "Ya then people cry about why Muslims live in Muslim majority area only, these people firstly don't allow them to get housing, then these targeted riots are going on for decades and decades. \n\nAlso I don't understand about this eating habits thing, a lot of Hindus themselves eat meat or eggs then why have problems if their tenets eat it? Like these people are always happy to eat biryani, mutton masala and all that are made by Muslims but are not okay with them getting housing? With all this religious bullshit I don't think this country is ever going to be developed. Call the west all the shit you want but at least they don't have riots in the name of imaginary idols.",
        "Development comes with economy which hardly depends on social movement or even contribution of all the members of society. I mean, Nazi Germany did pretty well economic wise with lots of current market leading companies founded during those times, the fast moving highways that are still the best in the world. And other colonial powers also became economic powerhouses from looting other nations. \n\nSo we are also seeing same in India. Gurgaon is the corporate center of India, it's hardly a cosmopolitan city but mostly a majority community led place, we are seeing maddening pace of highways development and other economic development. \n\nI think it is question of equity and parity in terms of development that will be missing. Muslims are already doing small, service type roles in the economy and hardly form 7-8 percent of India's working population. It's negligible to what the total Indian population is. We don't matter basically, so it's on us to stand up and be counted. Majority community would love us to disappear and most won't even notice."
