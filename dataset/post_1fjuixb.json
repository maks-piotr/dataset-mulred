    "selftext": "My parents (M72 and F64) were onboard Alliance Air flight 9i 506, from Cochin to Bengaluru on 15th Sept, 2024. To begin with, their flight was booked for 4:25 pm, but they preponed it to 12:45 pm. \n\nAfter takeoff, there were some scary sounds from the engine, and the pilots landed the flight at Coimbatore. \n\nThey crazy thing is, the pilots and crew just abandoned all passengers at Coimbatore and left the airport without taking any responsibility for how the passengers will get to Bengaluru. They told the passengers to figure it out on their own and that Alliance Air cannot help them. The Airport staff too were of no help. \n\nWhen my parents called me from the Coimbatore airport and told me about the situation, I called Alliance Air customer care number. They said they are, \"only a call center and cannot do anything in this situation\". I asked the customer service rep to escalate the call to his supervisor. He said that apparently the supervisor wasn't around. The only solution he gave was to email the custome care back end team, and said they'll reply after 24 hours. Seriously? 24 hours? What are the passengers supposed to do, sit in the airport for 24 hours waiting for an email reply? Ridiculous.\n\nMy parents eventually took a taxi from Coimbatore to Bengaluru. The standard rate was supposed to be approx Rs. 9000, but the taxi drivers figured that these passengers are in a tough situation, and decided to charge Rs. 13000. Luckily my parents found another 2 passengers going to Bengaluru, that they could share the taxi with. \n\nThe exhaustion from the long trip made them sick. Both of them got a fever. They had already travelled 3 hours in a taxi to reach the Cochin airport in the morning. Plus the 9 hour drive from Coimbatore to Bengaluru. \n\nI'm quite upset at Alliance Air for their lack of responsibility towards ensuring their passengers reach their intended destination. They should've arranged an alternate flight, and if not available the same day, they should have booked hotel rooms for the passengers. Instead they basically washed their hands of all responsibility.\n\nI'm going to reach out to Alliance Air and ask them to refund the flight tickets, as well as cover the extra expense incurred for the taxi to Bengaluru, as well as the money spent on the taxi my parents took to reach the Cochin airport, which ended up being a waste of money. Is there any law or airline policy to compensate passengers for the inconvenience and distress they've caused?\n\nTl;dr - Alliance Air flight made an emergency stop and just abandoned the passengers there to figure out their own way to reach their destination. This was a very difficult experience for my elderly parents, and I want to figure it/how Alliance Air would compensate them.",
