        "The girders (beams)  that the pier has to support are wideand so the top of the pier has to be extend out resulting in the pier being a T-shaped structure.\n\nThe top arms of the pier bend down due to the weight of the girder above, which results in tensile stressed at the top of the arms. Concrete has a lot of strength in compression but virtually none in tension, so we try to compensate for this difference by putting steel wires inside the top arms of the pier. The steel is then stretched and its stretched ends are attached to the end of the arms, which is what these protruding elements are. There are steel wires that are anchored to the concrete there. The steel can rust when exposed to the atmosphere, so it is covered by concrete or grout and that forms these protrusions.",
        "> This tensioning is to make it more ridgit.\n\nThat's isn't really the reason for prestressing the element. It's not rigidity but compensation of lack of tensile strength in concrete that necessitates the use of prestressing. It also make the element overall more elastic.\n\n> The rebar that is bend on top is just very sloppy and should have been cut off..\n\nIt isn't just sloppy, it is disastrous. It will lead to durability issues as rusting occurs at the base of the exposed rebar which will result in expansion of the rusted portion which will locally crack the concrete, leading to further exposure. All this near the anchorage of the prestressing cables! This pier won't last long.",
        "Read about prestressed concrete. In short each part of the bridge is casted elsewhere. It is simply carried, hoisted, leveled and steel bars are passed through these holes which are pulled on each side to put them in tensile state and then the holes are filled with concrete. This is the way different parts are joined together to form the section of the bridge.",
        "So from what I understand, that's prestressed concrete and those protrusions come from when new steel is added to prestressed blocks with new concrete?",
        "I hope they covee them up. For the purpose of making it less difficult to understand, it was a bit toned down. Pretensioning lets you get away with a smaller structure while maintaining the same strenght and as you said even more elastic..

        "Imagine a horizontal concrete beam supported in the center by a pillar and forming a T.  The ends of the horizontal concrete beam weigh down, which means the top portion of the beam is in \"tension\" being pulled apart, and the bottom portion of the beam is in \"compression\" being pushed together.  Concrete handles compression very well, but tension, not so very well or not at all.  So they put steel rods - the \"reinforcement\" in RCC (reinforced cement concrete).  Steel can handle tension very well.  So steel is added where the concrete is likely to give away due to compression to reinforce.",

        "Which specific part are you refering to? The large horizontal spans that carries the trains are called girders. The pillar holding it up is called a pier. The T shaped head at the top of the pier is called a pier cap. The 6 knob like things are steel rebars. They run through the girders too. Without them, the concrete will break.\n\nThe two square shaped thingy at the top of the pier cap holding the girder up are provided to allow for thermal expansion of the girders. If you notice closely, you can see there is a pad like thing between them and the girder. Those are called elastomeric bearing pads, a type of specially made synthetic rubber pad which buckles (but doesn't tear) when the girder expands, and returns to original shape when it cools down. Without them the two pieces of concrete will shred each other to bits.\n\nConcrete and steel have almost same thermal co-efficient or else this thing wouldn't have been possible.",

        "Actually a post-stressed concrete. But the same principle as prestressed. The idea is to apply tension to the rebars so they can handle more bending ( moments).",
        "The actual technical term is post-tensioned.\n\nPrestressed concrete comes in two forms: post-tensioned and pre-tensioned. And they use wires for tension, not rebar, which wouldn't work due to several reasons.",
