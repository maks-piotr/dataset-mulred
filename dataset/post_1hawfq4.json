        "It's all happening because the laws in India are fucked. Laws used to protect women are being misused by vile women. These laws were placed to save women from abusive husbands. But Indians have been using it to weaponize men. Obviously if people see such news, they'll get angry. The men will feel they are not being protected, their blood boils and start hating all women. The hate chain keeps on continuing.",
        "This is a fucked up cycle with no ending.\n\nCorporatism and politics is pushing a vicious cycle of profit at all cost. Consequences be damned.\n\nNow that is filtering down to a personal level of money at all cost.

        "I am not defending any one of those stories, but comparing the two posts, also think about the IQ, education and social and emotional setup of the two stories. More importantly, think about the judicial support one gets from both the stories  - meaning, if this guy (who committed suicide sadly) had gone to court in first story vs the girl complaining in court about  the Prashant guy harassing her, who will get the support first from courts, police and people?",

        "Unfortunately, most news I've read is about these laws being misused rather than women getting protection due to it. It's similar to the reservation. While my rich friends from low caste used to pay less for education due to reservation, we hear news about how low caste people are being harassed and killed in rural regions. The questions then arise, what's happening with laws in our country? They're mostly being just misused and the High and Mighty overlords including Judiciary, Government are doing nothing to improve the situation.",

After all it's natural instinct to bite, if he triggers the dog's predatory reaction, he must pay for it. \n\nDisgusting stain on the world",
        "Exactly. Our population is misogynyst, while judiciary is misandrist. There's no common ground. Our moral values are now just to get kinks by knowing someone's name, religion, cast, creed, gender, orientation and whatnot.",

There are literally around 30000 rapes (according to 2022 crime statistics) in India annually. Let that sink in! And this in only the data of rapes. There are all other sorts of crimes. \n\nBut women (most) don't get insecure and convert all these crimes happening everywhere to gender wars, unlike these lowlife incel parasites. One crime against a man (equally sad and tragic, please don't think I am justifying), and these guys get insecure and fearful and convert that thing to gender wars.",
