        "Hopefully we cross the 7% growth for FY24. The first two quarters have exceeded expectations and hopefully carry the momentum in the rest",
        "The only good thing to come out of the modi era is this sustained growth , unlike UPA 2 and its disaster class",
        "India as a country has gotten richer probably, but individuals, especially the poor, are still screwed. If with years of “sustained growth”, if the government still has to provide free food grains for ~60% of the population, are we actually moving ahead?",
        "That's why I said , it's the only good thing that has happened. Jumla can only take you so far.",
        "Atleast we are actually generating the revenue needed to sustain these subsidies. I say this is how this country should progress. Go full scale on expanding GDP, tax it and provide subsidies",
        "That is not a sustainable option. If increasing GDP does not correlate with alleviation of poverty, the number of people surviving on government subsidies will never go down.",
        "But increasing GDP eventually has to correlate with alleviation of poverty. Increased output has to come from people doing the jobs that creates the output. \n\nThere might be short term pinches as inefficient jobs are cut, but those who are left behind will find new jobs, and if they can’t they will need to upskill themselves, and if they still can’t they will need to survive on transfers.",
        "Modi govt changed the parameters of gdp growth calculation some years ago . If we compare it to UPA-2 it is still lower",
        "No it's not",
        "Interesting take.\n\nAny sauce?",
        ">> After a strong growth of 7.8% in the first quarter, the second quarter too surprised on the upside with 7.6% growth. This takes the first half GDP growth to a robust 7.7%.\n\n>> However, we still expect growth to slow in the second half due to deepening global slowdown; the lagged impact of domestic rate hikes manifesting fully through the second half of this fiscal; and erratic weather and an El Niño event creating some downside to agricultural growth prospects.The advance estimates from Ministry of Agriculture peg kharif production at 4.6% lower than last year. Despite moderation in the second half, India is expected to outperform other large economies this fiscal year.",
        "Yes, agriculture problems are due to the current weather and we were actually much worse off earlier. Many people now have access to electricity, clean water and toilet etc",
        "Average growthof UPA is still higher than Modi",
        "Good observation, but I think third quarter will exceed too due to festivals and wc.",
        "It didn’t. Infact poverty definition changed and multidimensional poverty was introduced which is much broader concept than poverty. \n\nStill we have a long way to go. Especially in manufacturing sector considering it has been stagnant at 15-16% since 1990. I think it will be successful if we broaden the horizon of make in India.",
        "Google 2015 GDP rebasing. The base year was changed.",
        "It’ll show domestic demand but it will also increase imports to a whole new level causing a high trade deficit (lowers gdp)",
        "If India was really growing close to 8% then job growth would be gangbusters.",
        "The reason why GDP is lower in the NDA period is because of the note ban and gst(2017 & 2018).",
        ">Vague. Just see the Infrastructure then and now. Just see the poverty then and now.\n\nJust see the infrastructure in 90s vs 2000s or 2004 vs 2014. Infrastructure and poverty reduction is a continuous process. Congress lifted crores of people from poverty. Most bhakts believe that India started developing only since 2014 but that's far from the truth.\n\nEven UPIs foundations were laid by UPA when it founded NPCI and brought in Rajan.\n\n> We used to take aid from England till 2011. \n\nLol that's a retarded take. They used to pay an extremely small amount as reparations and they stopped themselves. We never asked them for any aid. Please stop getting your news from WhatsApp. People like you believe any propaganda that your WhatsApp unkills send you lmao",
        "At that time poverty was measured on a simple factor. \nRight now it’s measured in multidimensional basis. Never denied that congress didn’t lift people out of poverty. \n\ncongress was corrupt to the core.  The whole govt sector was a nightmare. Coal sector, police, banking. Everything. And now before coming at me, i know this because my parents work there. \nSo many times CAG flagged reports , still no improvement. So many mouths were made shut.\n\nInfrastructure saw a massive development after 2014, there’s no denying. \nI am not a bhakt. I will vote for a party that has done more for me or people around me. \nUnder this govt, I saw the trickle down affect. As you said, we did take aid from England. It was aid nonetheless. Why were we taking aid in the first place? \nSingapore, South Korea. They all started with us and look at us and look at them. You are telling me after it took us 50 years to realise we don’t need aid? \n\nAnd please just because I refuted doesn’t mean I am “WhatsApp graduate”. Have some manners and listen to what other has to say before labelling ppl",
        "Answering datapoints with \"vague\" and \"see\", LMAO",
        "You literally just blabbered some word soup. Stick to GDP growth rate. UPA hd a higher rate than Modi govt.\n\nIf you bring unrelated crap, then I can surely talk about 45 year high unemployment after which government stoppd publishing data or how Modi hd an Oil price of 40 $ barrel whereas UPA had to deal with 140 dollars per barrel which was like a stroke of good luck for Modi.",
        "You do realize that if I have 100 Rs and it grows by 10% for 10 years and 8 % for the next 10 years, you will have more money at the end? But your money grew faster in the first 10.\n\nQuite  unsurprising that people most impressed by Modinomics lack basic understanding of maths.",
        "Bro got receipts.",
        "Now compare inflation.",
        "Yeah at that time the whole world was growing. Now even Vietnam is having hard time keeping 5% growth rate.",
        "Saving this to throw it on anyone who says Modi's Govt had better economical growth",
        "Population growth has outperformed it, massive influx of working age population. Plus women working as well",
        "I would caution against the growing optimism regarding growth rates.\n\nBecause essentially the job creation isn't matching the same pace.\n\nUPA 1 and 2 laid the foundation for this jobless growth. Essentially, they have increased the wages , but failed to create more jobs. Modi's government carried on this legacy.\n\nThe reason is the lack of reforms. We need major reforms on land, labour and agriculture to move onto the next phase of job growth. We needed that in 2005 itself. It's 2023, and we are still debating the pros and cons of farm laws.\n\nWe cannot have agriculture and the service sector take the entire burden of our GDP. The real strength lies in the manufacturing sector. We need to employ our demographic dividend and let them earn for their retirement. Else, we will miss the train. Such opportunities don't come back knocking out doors.",
        "Why is it inevitable? If the gdp growth is only benefiting a few, then is the growth really growth?\n\nGDP would have been amazingly high during colonial era India as well.",
        "these are real growth rates after correcting for inflation using the WPI inflator",
        "The unions don't allow reforms as seen during farmer protest. Result delhi is still polluted due to stubble burning and they want more subsidies, msp",
        "I dunno. The center has front-loaded a lot of its resources in the first half of the financial year.",
        "Female employment has gone down though",
        "we need Rahul as PM as soon as possible to bring the country back to this track of unprecedented growth we saw during UPA.",
        "Now compare unemployment. Now compare oil prices.",
        "Please compare our performance during recession years versus rest of the world. We were outperforming the world.",
        "That moron is one of BJP's biggest assets.\n\nHe'll rather drown with his party than stand aside.",
        "It is not the growth that matters but the growth in GDP per capita. Vietnams GDP per capita was equal to India’s in 2010s or so. Today it is double than India's despite always growing at ~5%. Why? Because India's currency devalues at double the rate so currency adjusted growth of India (7% growth but 5% currency devaluation) is still lower than Vietnam's (5% growth but 0% currency devaluation).\n\nResult? An avg Vietnamese's global relative purchasing power goes up. Higher proportion of Vietnamese can vacay abroad, study abroad, create wealth for their families, buy cheaper imports - so on and so forth. \n\nThe same thing is happening in Bangladesh. So while 7% GDP growth is good, it doesn't really paint the real story of GDP per capita which continues to languish in the bottom 30 percentile of countries worldwide.",
        "Love the denialism over here. Let's hope to reach 8% by 2025. People keep asking for reforms for job creation. But what happened when the govt tried? Labor unions backed by the left hijacked the country.",

        "I have never taken a basics economics class in my entire life so it is sufficient to say my understanding of theses things is practically zero. With that out of the way, someone please tell me how is it that Indian GDP keeps growing and we are projected to climb the GDP ladder even more, but for me personally all things are becoming more expensive and unaffordable? Like, where is all this growth going if the common man gets no benefit out of it?",
        "I am also a nincompoop, in terms of finance!\n\nHowever, I think this is another example of taxpayers not benefitting; but the country, as a whole, benefits!\n\nThat's what happens when you shoulder the burden of 99% of the population!\n\nAgain, armchair reddit user here!  /S",
        "GDP growth is measured in inflation adjusted dollars, not rupees. So if rupee devalues, the GDP must grow more to compensate.\n\nVietnam was 20% higher GDP per capita than India in 2010, now it's almost 60% higher. The difference is due to our population growth so the denominator in GDP per capita increasing.",
        "Vietnam has a one party rule. Setting up industries is way easier for them. They don't see continuous protest on every goddamn thing. They can plan for future and that's what they have done. \n\n\nThey have invested in infrastructure from the beginning while we always lagged behind and are slowly catching up",
        "If oil prices are generating higher inflation for 5 years then you would expect a competent government to actually do something about it. UPA 2 had many policy levers to pull such as lowering the state and union tax on petrol and diesel but they didn't do any of that.",
        "Stop bullshitting without information. UPA had lowest oil taxes. Modi govt consistently increased the taxes which effectively means that the price you pay for petrol has remained same or increased despite the prices coming down.",
        "> but the country, as a whole, benefits!\n\nI think it's an example of rich getting richer and poor getting poorer. The rich are benefiting but it is being presented as the country is getting richer.",

        "I have a genuine doubt...in the comments many are saying that there aren't enough jobs being generated....which I agree...but I feel like the problem with Indian Employment has been bad since a long time...we have been pretty one dimensional in the sectors we work in...service and agriculture are the largest employers but they are way oversaturated....I don't think we need more than 20% work force on agriculture and with all the jai Jawan Jai Kisan slogans this is a fact that farming is a sector with a very low margin and very high effort....so it is stupidity to romanticise it....half the farmers with labour reforms and industrialisation of the sector should give us a way better output....\n\nWe have a large population with people of different education backgrounds and to feed them fairly  we need something that can employ en masse and doesn't need a whole lot of education for it either....most skilled sectors need mental strength and need a degree and literacy which is sadly but realistically not with everyone in our country....they have to rely on their physical body to get food....without being a labourer....the government can't give them free dakhila to PSUs either....we need mass employment and manufacturing is one such sector....the Chinese had a similar problem as ours and they focus on manufacturing and that worked for them....we can try to emulate something similar albeit at a smaller scale (in comparison to be monstrous level the Cheems took it to) and get a good amount of manufacturing and hence the employment would go up, PCI would increase and economy would boom...why isn't the government wanting to do these changes ?? Labour laws and land laws need to change for this and Logistics have to improve....why did we not pursue this ?? what is the problem in such a setup?? Am I missing something??",
        "In fact, this is what commenters are mostly saying!\n\nThe jobless growth pattern is decades old!",
        " \n\nIndia's S&P Manufacturing PMI reading in November stood at 56, up from the eight-month low of 55.5 seen in October. That marked nearly two and a half years of the index being above the 50-mark",
        "Agriculture grew at 1.2%. What a shitshow. As long as the unholy quaternity of romanticization, vested interests, fear of private money and politics remains, agriculture will continue to be beholden to the whims of nature. And it will never be the quality job generator it has the potential to be. Literally handicapping our demographic dividend.",
        "Now do defence exports no. Of days took to add a trillion dollars in the economy, oil imports and exports.",
        "True (watch polymatter’s video)\n\nHowever it was indeed wise to invest in service sector in the 2000s. Indian industries would not have been able to compete with China (they were too big already and poster boy for foreign investment and US encouraged it). If India actually invested in the 60s-80s like Japan/Korea/China/Taiwan then it would be a different story but we were socialist and used USSR models (due to geopolitics and Cold War tensions with US against us). Now would be the best time to increase our manufacturing capabilities due to China + 1 situation. PLI scheme is good and all but that attracts only the big players and doesn’t address the real problems. Our biggest problem is that most companies in India only have around 8 people while in China, it’s mostly mid size at 200-500 people. This means most companies in India employ more and more companies to do some variation of a job which usually would take only 1 in other countries. This is very inefficient and also slows down our growth. We also have very low labour participation. If we don’t make any significant labour and agricultural reforms, our exports will pretty much be just Vietnam’s level (country way smaller than we are). Many people think agriculture industry would go south if people started going to other manufacturing or other industries etc but that is not the case (look at China for example)\n\nPolymatter’s vid also address this, i recommend people to watch it",

        "Yes, I have seen the video and did some research myself. Only then I understood the gravitas of the situation.\n\nWe would have done better if both the manufacturing and service sector scaled up at the same time. Manufacturing for the smaller towns, and service sector for the metropolitans. And HSR should have come sometime before 2019 itself.\n\nAt least we have cold war politics to blame before 1991. But now, there is no one but ourselves to blame for our current predicament. Both the parties failed in this regard. I would at least say that BJP has some what got it's priorities right, but Congress now is straight up insane.",
        "Yes. But the centre could have chosen to roll it on a state by state basis. First in those states where it's in power, then the economically sound states like Telangana and Tamil Nadu, and then the stubbornly socialist ones like Kerala and Punjab.

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "India GDP growth in Q2 FY24 beats estimates at 7.6%",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Hopefully we cross the 7% growth for FY24. The first two quarters have exceeded expectations and hopefully carry the momentum in the rest The only good thing to come out of the modi era is this sustained growth , unlike UPA 2 and its disaster class India as a country has gotten richer probably, but individuals, especially the poor, are still screwed. If with years of “sustained growth”, if the government still has to provide free food grains for ~60% of the population, are we actually moving ahead? That's why I said , it's the only good thing that has happened. Jumla can only take you so far. Atleast we are actually generating the revenue needed to sustain these subsidies. I say this is how this country should progress. Go full scale on expanding GDP, tax it and provide subsidies That is not a sustainable option. If increasing GDP does not correlate with alleviation of poverty, the number of people surviving on government subsidies will never go down. But increasing GDP eventually has to correlate with alleviation of poverty. Increased output has to come from people doing the jobs that creates the output. There might be short term pinches as inefficient jobs are cut, but those who are left behind will find new jobs, and if they can’t they will need to upskill themselves, and if they still can’t they will need to survive on transfers. Modi govt changed the parameters of gdp growth calculation some years ago . If we compare it to UPA-2 it is still lower No it's not Interesting take. Any sauce? >> After a strong growth of 7.8% in the first quarter, the second quarter too surprised on the upside with 7.6% growth. This takes the first half GDP growth to a robust 7.7%. >> However, we still expect growth to slow in the second half due to deepening global slowdown; the lagged impact of domestic rate hikes manifesting fully through the second half of this fiscal; and erratic weather and an El Niño event creating some downside to agricultural growth prospects.The advance estimates from Ministry of Agriculture peg kharif production at 4.6% lower than last year. Despite moderation in the second half, India is expected to outperform other large economies this fiscal year. Yes, agriculture problems are due to the current weather and we were actually much worse off earlier. Many people now have access to electricity, clean water and toilet etc Average growthof UPA is still higher than Modi Good observation, but I think third quarter will exceed too due to festivals and wc. It didn’t. Infact poverty definition changed and multidimensional poverty was introduced which is much broader concept than poverty. Still we have a long way to go. Especially in manufacturing sector considering it has been stagnant at 15-16% since 1990. I think it will be successful if we broaden the horizon of make in India. Google 2015 GDP rebasing. The base year was changed. It’ll show domestic demand but it will also increase imports to a whole new level causing a high trade deficit (lowers gdp) If India was really growing close to 8% then job growth would be gangbusters. The reason why GDP is lower in the NDA period is because of the note ban and gst(2017 & 2018). >Vague. Just see the Infrastructure then and now. Just see the poverty then and now. Just see the infrastructure in 90s vs 2000s or 2004 vs 2014. Infrastructure and poverty reduction is a continuous process. Congress lifted crores of people from poverty. Most bhakts believe that India started developing only since 2014 but that's far from the truth. Even UPIs foundations were laid by UPA when it founded NPCI and brought in Rajan. > We used to take aid from England till 2011. Lol that's a retarded take. They used to pay an extremely small amount as reparations and they stopped themselves. We never asked them for any aid. Please stop getting your news from WhatsApp. People like you believe any propaganda that your WhatsApp unkills send you lmao At that time poverty was measured on a simple factor. Right now it’s measured in multidimensional basis. Never denied that congress didn’t lift people out of poverty. congress was corrupt to the core. The whole govt sector was a nightmare. Coal sector, police, banking. Everything. And now before coming at me, i know this because my parents work there. So many times CAG flagged reports , still no improvement. So many mouths were made shut. Infrastructure saw a massive development after 2014, there’s no denying. I am not a bhakt. I will vote for a party that has done more for me or people around me. Under this govt, I saw the trickle down affect. As you said, we did take aid from England. It was aid nonetheless. Why were we taking aid in the first place? Singapore, South Korea. They all started with us and look at us and look at them. You are telling me after it took us 50 years to realise we don’t need aid? And please just because I refuted doesn’t mean I am “WhatsApp graduate”. Have some manners and listen to what other has to say before labelling ppl Answering datapoints with \"vague\" and \"see\", LMAO You literally just blabbered some word soup. Stick to GDP growth rate. UPA hd a higher rate than Modi govt. If you bring unrelated crap, then I can surely talk about 45 year high unemployment after which government stoppd publishing data or how Modi hd an Oil price of 40 $ barrel whereas UPA had to deal with 140 dollars per barrel which was like a stroke of good luck for Modi. You do realize that if I have 100 Rs and it grows by 10% for 10 years and 8 % for the next 10 years, you will have more money at the end? But your money grew faster in the first 10. Quite unsurprising that people most impressed by Modinomics lack basic understanding of maths. Bro got receipts. Now compare inflation. Yeah at that time the whole world was growing. Now even Vietnam is having hard time keeping 5% growth rate. Saving this to throw it on anyone who says Modi's Govt had better economical growth Population growth has outperformed it, massive influx of working age population. Plus women working as well I would caution against the growing optimism regarding growth rates. Because essentially the job creation isn't matching the same pace. UPA 1 and 2 laid the foundation for this jobless growth. Essentially, they have increased the wages , but failed to create more jobs. Modi's government carried on this legacy. The reason is the lack of reforms. We need major reforms on land, labour and agriculture to move onto the next phase of job growth. We needed that in 2005 itself. It's 2023, and we are still debating the pros and cons of farm laws. We cannot have agriculture and the service sector take the entire burden of our GDP. The real strength lies in the manufacturing sector. We need to employ our demographic dividend and let them earn for their retirement. Else, we will miss the train. Such opportunities don't come back knocking out doors. Why is it inevitable? If the gdp growth is only benefiting a few, then is the growth really growth? GDP would have been amazingly high during colonial era India as well. these are real growth rates after correcting for inflation using the WPI inflator The unions don't allow reforms as seen during farmer protest. Result delhi is still polluted due to stubble burning and they want more subsidies, msp I dunno. The center has front-loaded a lot of its resources in the first half of the financial year. Female employment has gone down though we need Rahul as PM as soon as possible to bring the country back to this track of unprecedented growth we saw during UPA. Now compare unemployment. Now compare oil prices. Please compare our performance during recession years versus rest of the world. We were outperforming the world. That moron is one of BJP's biggest assets. He'll rather drown with his party than stand aside. It is not the growth that matters but the growth in GDP per capita. Vietnams GDP per capita was equal to India’s in 2010s or so. Today it is double than India's despite always growing at ~5%. Why? Because India's currency devalues at double the rate so currency adjusted growth of India (7% growth but 5% currency devaluation) is still lower than Vietnam's (5% growth but 0% currency devaluation). Result? An avg Vietnamese's global relative purchasing power goes up. Higher proportion of Vietnamese can vacay abroad, study abroad, create wealth for their families, buy cheaper imports - so on and so forth. The same thing is happening in Bangladesh. So while 7% GDP growth is good, it doesn't really paint the real story of GDP per capita which continues to languish in the bottom 30 percentile of countries worldwide. Love the denialism over here. Let's hope to reach 8% by 2025. People keep asking for reforms for job creation. But what happened when the govt tried? Labor unions backed by the left hijacked the country. These are real GDP growth rates. Secondly inflation comparison with oil prices added are as below - Infln Oil Prices 2004 3.77 41.51 2005 4.25 56.64 2006 5.8 66.05 2007 6.37 72.34 2008 8.35 99.67 2009 10.8 61.95 2010 12 79.48 2011 8.91 94.88 2012 9.48 94.05 2013 10 97.98 2014 6.67 93.17 2015 4.91 48.66 2016 4.95 43.29 2017 3.33 50.8 2018 3.94 65.23 2019 3.73 56.99 2020 6.62 39.68 2021 5.13 68.17 2022 6.7 94.53 Inf Oil Price Avg UPA 1 5.7 67 USD Avg UPA 2 9.65 87 USD Avg Modi 4.92 58 USD I have never taken a basics economics class in my entire life so it is sufficient to say my understanding of theses things is practically zero. With that out of the way, someone please tell me how is it that Indian GDP keeps growing and we are projected to climb the GDP ladder even more, but for me personally all things are becoming more expensive and unaffordable? Like, where is all this growth going if the common man gets no benefit out of it? I am also a nincompoop, in terms of finance! However, I think this is another example of taxpayers not benefitting; but the country, as a whole, benefits! That's what happens when you shoulder the burden of 99% of the population! Again, armchair reddit user here! /S GDP growth is measured in inflation adjusted dollars, not rupees. So if rupee devalues, the GDP must grow more to compensate. Vietnam was 20% higher GDP per capita than India in 2010, now it's almost 60% higher. The difference is due to our population growth so the denominator in GDP per capita increasing. Vietnam has a one party rule. Setting up industries is way easier for them. They don't see continuous protest on every goddamn thing. They can plan for future and that's what they have done. They have invested in infrastructure from the beginning while we always lagged behind and are slowly catching up If oil prices are generating higher inflation for 5 years then you would expect a competent government to actually do something about it. UPA 2 had many policy levers to pull such as lowering the state and union tax on petrol and diesel but they didn't do any of that. Stop bullshitting without information. UPA had lowest oil taxes. Modi govt consistently increased the taxes which effectively means that the price you pay for petrol has remained same or increased despite the prices coming down. > but the country, as a whole, benefits! I think it's an example of rich getting richer and poor getting poorer. The rich are benefiting but it is being presented as the country is getting richer. Covid was much bigger issue for India compared to 200 Which is why if you remove Covid and Recession years, UPA still comes out on top The populace has definitely benefitted, albeit, not as much as the rich! The rich, of course, will always benefit; regardless of circumstances!🤷🏻‍♂️ How convenient ? We have something called Covid from 2020 March where the entire world economy was shutdown. Why not compare the growth with other countries during the same period? . Seems like a you are fan boy of RaGa . Also compare the # of terrorist attacks during the UPA and Modi This is another misinformation.

India outperformed the world during UPA. > Seems like a you are fan boy of RaGa . Seems like you are a Chaddi loduboy I have a genuine doubt...in the comments many are saying that there aren't enough jobs being generated....which I agree...but I feel like the problem with Indian Employment has been bad since a long time...we have been pretty one dimensional in the sectors we work in...service and agriculture are the largest employers but they are way oversaturated....I don't think we need more than 20% work force on agriculture and with all the jai Jawan Jai Kisan slogans this is a fact that farming is a sector with a very low margin and very high effort....so it is stupidity to romanticise it....half the farmers with labour reforms and industrialisation of the sector should give us a way better output.... We have a large population with people of different education backgrounds and to feed them fairly we need something that can employ en masse and doesn't need a whole lot of education for it either....most skilled sectors need mental strength and need a degree and literacy which is sadly but realistically not with everyone in our country....they have to rely on their physical body to get food....without being a labourer....the government can't give them free dakhila to PSUs either....we need mass employment and manufacturing is one such sector....the Chinese had a similar problem as ours and they focus on manufacturing and that worked for them....we can try to emulate something similar albeit at a smaller scale (in comparison to be monstrous level the Cheems took it to) and get a good amount of manufacturing and hence the employment would go up, PCI would increase and economy would boom...why isn't the government wanting to do these changes ?? Labour laws and land laws need to change for this and Logistics have to improve....why did we not pursue this ?? what is the problem in such a setup?? Am I missing something?? In fact, this is what commenters are mostly saying! The jobless growth pattern is decades old! India's S&P Manufacturing PMI reading in November stood at 56, up from the eight-month low of 55.5 seen in October. That marked nearly two and a half years of the index being above the 50-mark Agriculture grew at 1.2%. What a shitshow. As long as the unholy quaternity of romanticization, vested interests, fear of private money and politics remains, agriculture will continue to be beholden to the whims of nature. And it will never be the quality job generator it has the potential to be. Literally handicapping our demographic dividend. Now do defence exports no. Of days took to add a trillion dollars in the economy, oil imports and exports. True (watch polymatter’s video) However it was indeed wise to invest in service sector in the 2000s. Indian industries would not have been able to compete with China (they were too big already and poster boy for foreign investment and US encouraged it). If India actually invested in the 60s-80s like Japan/Korea/China/Taiwan then it would be a different story but we were socialist and used USSR models (due to geopolitics and Cold War tensions with US against us). Now would be the best time to increase our manufacturing capabilities due to China + 1 situation. PLI scheme is good and all but that attracts only the big players and doesn’t address the real problems. Our biggest problem is that most companies in India only have around 8 people while in China, it’s mostly mid size at 200-500 people. This means most companies in India employ more and more companies to do some variation of a job which usually would take only 1 in other countries. This is very inefficient and also slows down our growth. We also have very low labour participation. If we don’t make any significant labour and agricultural reforms, our exports will pretty much be just Vietnam’s level (country way smaller than we are). Many people think agriculture industry would go south if people started going to other manufacturing or other industries etc but that is not the case (look at China for example) Polymatter’s vid also address this, i recommend people to watch it Baap ka naukar samjha hai kya? That is nt the only criteria First 2-3 years of UP was basically effect of reforms for previous government. When UPA got government they goot a booming government, When UPA left, they left economy in fragile 5 category. Fucking look at the data before commenting absurd stuff. You can clearly see that Modi had high growth in initial years and later on GDP slumped.b Hi there. It is quite impressive how you are able to gather all these data points. Can you please guide me where you get them from? I google searched and found third party sources that don't cite any sources themselves. So I'm looking for reliable government published sources like FRED in the US. Thanks in advance! Same. I don't get it. My dad bought two plots in prime areas of my city and built a huge house on a teachers salary. Many of us can't do it on a SE salary. Yes, I have seen the video and did some research myself. Only then I understood the gravitas of the situation. We would have done better if both the manufacturing and service sector scaled up at the same time. Manufacturing for the smaller towns, and service sector for the metropolitans. And HSR should have come sometime before 2019 itself. At least we have cold war politics to blame before 1991. But now, there is no one but ourselves to blame for our current predicament. Both the parties failed in this regard. I would at least say that BJP has some what got it's priorities right, but Congress now is straight up insane. Yes. But the centre could have chosen to roll it on a state by state basis. First in those states where it's in power, then the economically sound states like Telangana and Tamil Nadu, and then the stubbornly socialist ones like Kerala and Punjab. Similar to the style they rolled out GST. Of course, it's all in hindsight. And maybe we as people are also failing our nation. It's the governments job to get everyone on board. Popularise the reforms. Don't do shady things like bypassing the parliament. Follow the due process. Every other government in history had this problem. Nothing special about the current administration. Government has the mandate to create and enforce new laws. They are just chickening out because it affects their votebank. Has the government made any ballsy new law in the last 10 years they have been in power? Bro, why are people like you less on reddit ? Why people hate unbiased arguments? Aah but you didn't take into account the rising geopolitical tensions in Europe and middle East. I think even after that UPA and NDA would basically be the same. The numbers must be true but your conclusion and some echo-chamberish derogatory remarks aren't justified and and are incorrect. In the last 10 years the amount of change we have seen in technology, geopolitical tensions, natural calamities and wars is much more greater and has had a devastating effect on the Indian economy than comparative change we had considering the above factors in the last 20 years. And btw some GDP number isn't a concrete way to determine which government is a better, its actually stupid and childish. Accept it or not, people of India chose this government, you don't like it fine, vote for someone else. Don't whine on reddit. Yeah, GDP and all is fine and I do commend the government for what all good things they have done. Problems Infrastructure development is very slow. Political parties spending heavily on election rallies for some reason. Cast based census and cast based reservation is still a thing. Heavy taxes on salaried individuals, unnecessary freebies to farmers with no sustainable cropping patterns, pollution and shit. And above all, why the hell aren't madarasas banned ? There is a hell lot of communal hatred taught there. Thanks for your feedback. The thing is Numbers don't lie. Your feelings and emotions may lead you to believe something but I prefer talking in numbers. I don't wish to engage with people like you. You are another layman who uses strawman argument and just calls an argument childish, incorrect, stupid and whatnot. Your response has no numbers, no data, no alternate economic theories which would explain the data. Even if I spend hours in drafting a careful response diving deep into economic theories, GDP deflator, inflation, unemployment, etc, you will spend 2 mins to discard everything and just call the comment stupid. No amount of data can convince the blind. Please continue with your superiority complex. Andar se khokhle hi rahoge ! Alright, you want to play this game fine, can you please explain how the average GDP numbers 6.86 % is related to UPA ? In case you are being serious and not a troll, then the geopolitical tensions in Middle East during 2004 were far more. There was a NATO war against Gulf going on. Please check the active conflicts in that era. Still lesser than today, plus there has been a huge event withdrawal of the Americans from afg No I don't want to play this game. Someone who doesn't understand how an average is calculated is certainly not qualified enough to discuss economics. You are right sir. Full sappot sir. That is why the comparison of World GDP is given lol. A good metric to judge performance is whether we are outperforming the world as the macroeconomic factors remain the same for the entire world. As the data clearly shows, we were consistently outperforming the world average to a higher extent during UPA. See, devil is in the detail, you wanted to play the numbers game right why are you running now ? Yes but how is that related to UPA ? Because i am scared of you Did you forget the abysmal economic state before 2019 or did Covid clear that out for you too? Growth decreased post 2016. We were at all time high rate of unemployments right before the 2019 elections. This is all before Covid. Source of these numbers? Everything gets expensive. Say an apple got expensive for you. You lay higher amount to the street hawker. It means he earns more. So wages also increase. Unfortunately agriculture is highly cyclical and wide ranges are unavoidable. There are hardly any unions left in the private sector. An IT engineer at the big firms gets an initial salary of around 4 lac today the same they got 10 years ago. Wages aren't increasing significantly either. Manufacturing as percentage of GDP was higher under UPA then today despite PLI scheme. I don't have the chart handy but it's there I think IT cell does more than enough balancing act to counter out the madrasa. Yes sir, come up with whatever reason that enables you to jerk off onto supreme leaders photo. People with analytical skills are why India is getting this growth. If left you Upto IT cell type thinking we would all be lundfakirs Here's one for you. The entire trend of abusing people started under this august government. Their IT cell is the leader in that. And he didn't deny that this government is elected democratically. And reddit is for whining and abuse go fuck yourself This is typical behavior of these IT cell type thinkers. They'll never accept data contrary to their imagination. They jerk off in their confirmation bias. You have a lot more patience than me. Government of India. Jai Shri Ram This is new India for you. Over confident and under skilled. Don't know how real GDP numbers are calculated. World Bank website. You can go there and download the data in csv format Yes and more people started using technology during NDA due to jio, that's why this claim is also invalid. It also has to manage its fiscal deficit This is including covid data. If we remove years of 2020 (covid plunge) and 2021 (recovery year), average gdp is 6.9% (taking 2023 too) If you remove Covid year of 2020 and Recession year of 2008, UPA still comes out better 2 things: - Whole world was growing then. Right now the whole world is stagnating/contracting but India is keeping up it's growth - There's more room to grow the less developed you are and the lower your GDP. The fact that they've been able to maintain this growth even as the GDP has increased by this much is an achievement of its own. This is another misinformation. Year|India GDP growth|World GDP growth :--|:-- |:-- 2004|7.92|4.47 2005 |7.92|4.00 2006 |8.06|4.42 2007|7.66|4.38 2008|3.09|2.07 2009|7.86|-1.34 2010|8.50|4.54 2011|5.24|3.32 2012 |5.46|2.71 2013|6.39|2.81 2014|7.41|3.07 2015|8.00|3.08 2016|8.26|2.81 2017|6.80|3.39 2018|6.45|3.29 2019|3.87|2.59 2020 |-5.83|-3.07 2021|9.05|6.02 2022|7.00|3.08 Label|India Average Growth Rate|World Average GDP Growth Rate|Delta of India over World :--|:--|:--|:-- UPA|6.86%|3.13%|3.73% Modi|5.67%|2.65%|3.02% Which shows India outperformed the world during UPA. Second thing. India has 1/5th the economy of China and yet it cannot come close to its growth rate (5 year average) Pretty misleading to use an average when Modi had a blackswan event of Covid during his term lol. Well even if you remove Covid and recession year of 2008, UPA still comes out better lol. Already mentioned this in parent comment but expecting people to read is too much these days 2008 was a western and American centric recession. You realize what a recession is right? It's negative GDP growth, and the only recession India has had since 1999 was covid -- because that was worldwide and systemic Global recession affected every country equally. The sub prime mortgage crisis was the trigger which led to the recession but every country including Africa and Asia was impacted. Globalisation means any event impacts every country. Also covid affected every country so world average would anyway take care of it. India performed worse than the world during Covid. The purpose of comparing with world is to minimize the impact of events which affect the entire world. You would know that if you weren't an absolute moron."
