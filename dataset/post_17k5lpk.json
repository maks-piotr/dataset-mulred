Ofcourse he wouldn't have a problem working 80 hours since he is not a normal person who has to travel by metro everyday for two hours, he can work from home if he choose to , he can work in his car if he chooses to, hell he can build a bunglow next to his office if he chooses to. He's not a normal person who has to spend two hours everyday to cook a healthy meal for himself and his family, he can hire a chef everyday to cook meals for himself. He can get fruits of his labour for working 80 hours a week, he himself wouldn't pay more to his employees for working more than required.",
