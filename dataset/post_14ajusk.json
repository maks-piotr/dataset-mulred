        ">Following the additional public prosecutor‚Äôs clarification, Justice Dave said, ‚ÄúThe APP is saying that if something comes from the court, the people are criticising you‚Ä¶but one thing I may say, judge should be like Sthita Pragna the definition of which is given in Shrimad Bhagvad Gita chapter 2, shloka 54 to 72. And the judge has to be like that. So praising or criticising, one should ignore both the things.‚Äù\n\nDo they study law and constitution or manusmriti and gita?",
        "What type of compromise they want?",
        "Considering the past cases, definitely asking the victim to marry the rapist",

She didn‚Äôt deserve any of this.And seriously how in the world are such disgusting people even allowed to be judges. One should never mix up religion with judiciary. But after all this is India, people put religion first before anything else in most cases and also try to justify their regressive views in the name of religion.That rapist should be hanged!!",

Tradition does not dictate legality. 500 years ago kings had the authority to kill anyone they want without question. Are you saying according to that, the king equivalent of the current society has the same right as well? How the fuck do these idiots become judges with no morality or conscience. So this old sick fuck want to make a compromise between a rape accused and a minor rape victim. These old stone age mentality people really need to die off in a gutter or something. They really deserve all the hate they get. Why? Women can want a Hindu Rashtra too. Something just occurred to me. What if the rape victim was not a minor but a single mother? Would Court suggest the same thing? Marrying her rapist? So kid has to call the man 'Dad', who raped his/her mother? I have seen Muslim women, especially from more conservative families supporting Sharia law as well It's surprising just how dumb humans can be When you find a group making a choice it's usually for a reason. The reason can be dumb, but it makes sense for them at the time. I guess in this specific case people are voting for the triple talaq ban and similar issues. Saudi Arabia charges those women who are unable to prove rape with adultery. They are punished with imprisonment, lashings and even death by stoning. Hence, the low number of rape cases in Saudi. Read some reports by human rights groups instead of blindly sucking up to those savages just because they are Muslim. Not sucking up to them. I know the law, you can't get punished if witness are not brought by you. If they are doing it then it is wrong. A person is only punished by death if they themselves do adultery and is seen by witnesses. Now who would have sex in open? Religious law.. I read and what the fuck..... Want Israel, got Saudi. Lol so implementing their own version of sharia law and stuff. Save us man Girl also gets punished for adultery, so what happens more often is the victim is often married off to the rapist I hope the judge remembers that rape is a non-compoundable offense. Isme compromises nhi hoga ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE LAND. if his wife was raped, would he compromise with the rapist to share the wife? someone should ask this to the learned judge. >Saudi Arabia charges those women who are unable to prove rape with adultery. No. Stop lying. According to sharia which Saudi Arabia follows, a women(or a man for that matter) can only be charged with adultery if you produce 4 eyewitness against them. No because you can only get charged for adultery if there are 4 eyewitness who have seen who commit adultery. I don't think you should speak false news."
