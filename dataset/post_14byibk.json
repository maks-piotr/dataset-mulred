    "selftext": "Greeting fellow Indian homies, \n\n  \n**Disclaimer: This post will contain some parts of discussing different religion and LGBTQ community, this is to bring up a conversation and in no way trying to attack a specific community.**   \n\n\nI don't know about you all, I am tired and mentally exhausted looking at the hate being spread on social media platforms. Against women, lgbtq community, and peoples own perception of masculinity. I notice this mostly on social media, and occasionally from what my friends say. Whenever I open my youtube, the content that is pushed to me is the red pill community, with some brain dead dick riders, who claim that \"woman, have no hobbies!\", \"Being Gay or abeing ny member of the LGBTQ community is a mental illness\", \"Men don't have to be loyal because they can spread there seed (first of all, anytime I hear that, I want to puke), yet woman have to stay loyal to men because they can be pregnant by only one person and after that they are a bagage.\" Everytime I get this video, I choose, do not recommend, however they still pop-up. They claim to want traditional woman, who have to house wifes, shouldn't have male friends, shouldn't work but need to sign a prenup, like what kinda brain dead fuck face thinks like that. I thought people are smart enough to realize that this is crap, yeti  I look at the comments and they only seemed to support it, like bruh, think for yourself.   \n\n\nNot only that, I have been watching the content on instagram that are heavily targeting women for no reason, a clip of woman making a stupid mistake, and everyone in the comment section begins to generalise it with a comment \"women\". I get that people are just trying to make a joke, but it has stopped being a joke and became more of a instigation technique. God forbid you make a comment on men doing stupid shit and the replies from butt hurt men, who claim that is not a joke but an attack on male community, yet they can also comment \"women\" but women have to take it as a joke. The audacity.  \n\n\nThen there any of the LGBTQ posts, even as simple as a \"Happy Pride\" post gets so much disgust and hatred as people begin to claim \"it is not part of hinduism, it is mental illness!\", \"Western Media Influence\"  well my fellow hindu's, you're wrong, LGBTQ, maybe the acronym that we might have  taken from the western media but the acts of homosexuality and transgenderism has been in Hinduism for a very long time. Sources: [https://academic.oup.com/book/11527/chapter-abstract/160309678?redirectedFrom=fulltext](https://academic.oup.com/book/11527/chapter-abstract/160309678?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0223.xml](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0223.xml), [https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/10-instances-of-homosexuality-among-lgbts-in-ancient-india-1281446-2018-07-10](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/10-instances-of-homosexuality-among-lgbts-in-ancient-india-1281446-2018-07-10). Like if you don't support and are repelled by the community, fine, whatever, but to go on to the posts that are catered for LGBTQ community and comment about how you are being forced to watch or endure, you can scroll past or even stop following them, instead you go to a place that was dedicated for safety for the people in community, for them to feel welcome, the haters go there to attack. How do you feel if atheists and agnostics comes to your church, your temple or your mosque and say you have mental illness for believing in an imaginary bearded man in the sky. Live and let live.   \n\n\nFinally the Tate meat riders, the amount of people claim Andrew Tate to be a messiah and spread his words as wisdom is just so stupid. Some people follow him for his content, I get it, he is a charismatic guy, how ever, their are people who see him as role models are the biggest sheep. Like why is he a good role model? The man offers nothing but materialistic ideology and money, that is what he just sells. People forget to see how he made money, through cam sites, taking advantage of depressed men, casino's, gambling. He then preaches that he is a man of Islam and his principles are based off of Quran, I will admit my knowledge about the Quran is limited, still I do know it condones, alcohol and gambling, to him, he is just using the religion as a cover to hide his bad influences. I don't care if people drink or not, but claiming to a man of god, yet indulging in sin, is a great indicator that they are a hypocrite. At the end of the day, he is a clout chaser, and I wish he just admits it and his fans stop treating him like Morpheus who is giving them a way out of the matrix.  \n\n\nI say this again, I get that people have freedom to watch what they please, nothing wrong with that, but all the content that we consume nowadays are just generating hate and dividing the communities for no reason, there's no need to be a battle between sexes, all of us are co dependent, we can't claim \"God, I hate people!\", \"People Suck\" without even putting an effort to even be kind to each other. We can't find kindness anywhere, if we are lucky, we bump into angels of a people, that remind us that kind people exist. Not all of us are privileged to have kind people around. So let's just be kind, and nice to each other, even if our opinions differ.",

        "There are kid safe websites, filters, apps etc. It's upto the parent to setup restrictions. But yes, even when you do that, they can be exposed to harmful things sometimes.\n\nAlthough IMO, the topic you're talking about is more relevant to adults.",

Adolescents can make teens feel as if being rebellious is cool and right, I mean I thought that I went through it, but I had some good guidance to help me navigate.",
        "Yes ikr, it‚Äôs so exhausting. I really don‚Äôt understand the hate towards lgbtq. It‚Äôs seen as this grave sin, or as something disgusting by most people. I just don‚Äôt get that even if your faith/cultural values doesn‚Äôt allow homosexuality, why is it your business? You follow your faith and traditions, and let others follow theirs lol. Plus, the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs unnatural, we need babies‚Äù argument is so stupid. Majority of the world is straight, hell, we‚Äôre still having overpopulation crisis atleast in some countries lol. Imagine if all straight people suddenty turned gay for some short time, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be quick to take away all their harsh views, considering the fact that it‚Äôs not a choice that people make. :/ \n\nAnd don‚Äôt get me started on those red pill bros! I‚Äôm so exhausted of them. I just block those accounts, and live peacefully knowing that there are some idiots out there who‚Äôd never achieve true enlightenment, and I shouldn‚Äôt waste my time on them :)",
        "I agree with you, I can't tell you how much it rages me, when certain religious groups acts oppressed, like they haven‚Äôt stoned, electrocuted and murdered people for just existing as part of an LGBTQ community.   \n\n\nThe red pill bros are worse for sure, but the red pill \"Pick me\" girls are even worse \"I don't think women should have the right to vote\" like bitch! Go and read a book!",
        "I‚Äôm a part of that religious groupüíÄ so pls don‚Äôt generalize, but I get your sentiment. \n\nYes ik, it sucks to see women hating on women. Like hey, if we don‚Äôt hold onto each other, who will? :/",
        "Of course, I didn‚Äôt mean to generalise, I used it as a broad term instead of targeting any specific religion but I understand and agree with your point.",
        "And have you noticed how they bring some really uneducated girls to these podcasts and videos? I‚Äôve seen so many people point out this hypocrisy, that they should be bringing actually learned women for discussions. But ofc they won‚Äôt because we all know what‚Äôd happen lol :)",
        "Oh god yes! It is sad to see, I don‚Äôt understand my these women go onto these podcasts only to get shit on by dudes whose whole personality is like a tuna can.",
        "Internalized misogyny - that‚Äôs the term for it. I don‚Äôt hate those women, I just feel sad for them sometimes, because they still attach their self-worth and existence to a man, instead of their ownselves. I hope they break free out of it, because in the end, we‚Äôre humans, and deserve some level of equality",

        "Don‚Äôt forget that reddit itself is a hub for such assholes. The gender ratio here is so bad (especially on indian subs) that even if you as a women say something slightly opinionated regarding men , the whole mass of incel comments would be flooded in your inbox because it‚Äôs that easy. Internet anonymity has given liberty to such people to bully and pass hateful comments with no consequences whatsoever.Someone said that every subreddit has a mass of people that are the echo chambers of a certain issue. Misogyny, making homophobic ‚Äúdank‚Äù comments, passing sexual remarks on women, is THE ISSUE  of such subreddits.",

        "Is being gay a case of nature or nurture? Either way it's beyond that person's control, no point in hating and discriminating folks for it.\nIf they start to become a pain in your ass, you can choose to fight them...or use a better lube",

        "You said exactly what I always think OP, thank you for putting into words. This is the only reason why I deactivated my Instagram and really don't want to get back into it anytime soon. \n\nSeeing people like this makes me sooo scared. It's sad and pathetic to see this hatred. Such intolerance, so much negativity, and the comment section is so disgusting for many posts. Someone makes a valid point and they are called names. Like people's first instinct in comments is to abuse others rather than logically talking or saying. \nIt's messed up",
        "Wow you're so cool",
        "They had a good run when they were used for harmless fun. Now they just turned into an insult that insecure incels use.",
        "It is sad, the young men are being influenced to think that there is a war between sexes, where is not a battle, we are trying to survive and we need each other. Sad to see many man completely disregard feminism as a western propaganda and it spreads hate against men, when it is not the case.",
        "Yeah, As a guy I understand, sometimes I just think people want others to this what they say is funny, only needs to be taken as funny joke, even if what said is a direct attack on a person. Humor requires thinking skills, can't attack/bully a person and them regard that as a joke.",
        "Lmao! Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half",
        "NO THIS IS PATRICK!!",
        "Thanks homie!",
        "The comment section has gone toxic, filled with people who want fake validation from other fake internet people, being different makes you unique, so hate things that people love. It's just a way of expressing their own self worth and insecurities I guess, when they try to bring people down for enjoying something. When asked why speak if they didn't like it, they say \"It's my opinion, get over it!\", that's calling a new born baby ugly for no reason and when the pissed of parents ask \"why\", 'Cuz duh! I have free speech!\". It is indeed sad",
        "Saw this comment section.  A Muslim guy did great in neet ug like scored a rank in 3 digits and topped like the entire north east. Oh my god the comments. They were all targetting his religion. I was shocked. Nobody was congratulating him. It was a war in the comments. The Muslims were acting like he won for the community and the Hindus were just... Idk man. It's sick. Everyone is retarded at this point.",
        "That is sad, everyone one are being influenced to hate, they are being taught to generalize which and false patriotic self imposed values that make them want to hate anyone that doesn't belong to a particular community. It is sad.",
        "Dark humour stopped being funny when everyone started to try it. Saying kill all gay people lol is not funny.",
        "I have been so tired of all that toxic stuff that i actively filtered my feed to only show cat videos and my other hobbies(like gaming,shows etc ) but Indian Instagram community is extremely toxic by this 12 year old wannabe chads",
        "\"Kill all Gays\" \"Bruh it's just a joke bruh\" \"what's the joke you ask?\" \"Like all gays will be killed duh!\" \"see so funny!\"",
        "That is a very healthy way of navigating social media! The wanna be chads don't understand that their whole person is built on hiding their feelings and projecting their insecurities on others. It is sad, I heard a 10 class kid, I met at a function say to me, that he and his friends think  \"Hitler is in the right! He should be idolized\" That in itself terrified me, as it left me wondering as of what are these kids latching onto these days.",

        "I get when you are coming from, especially when it comes to Transgender movement, not a lot of people understand it, lot of people are scared to talk about or question it, because they fear they will be labelled as a transphobe. The whole subject of Gender dus photos is not topic for sure, as the first case dates back to the 19th century: https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/885694#:~:text=The%20diagnosis%20of%20people%20with,Psychopathia%20Sexualis%2C%20called%20it%20homosexuality.\n\nThat said, it makes sense of what you propose, lot of people are now aware of this due to social media and most of the cases that goes viral seemed to be the bad cases that are used in the echo chambers. It is still a subject that is being discussed, which is interesting because there is a lot of gender change in Thailand for example and there is a huge acceptance of them over there. \n\nI also know the documentary you are talking about, the one with Matt Walsh I‚Äôm assuming, I generally don‚Äôt like the guy, and his documentary ‚ÄúWhat is a woman‚Äù was a head ache to go through, I have no idea why the people who he chose to debate, couldn‚Äôt even answer a simple question of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs is a woman‚Äù, especially where there is gender science professor sitting in front him. His logic is biased from bible and can countered a lot. \n\nHe claims, woman are the ones that can get pregnant as that it what it states in the Bible, yet it can be tackled with ‚Äúwhat about women that are infertile‚Äù. I think the answer to ‚Äúwhat is a woman‚Äù is quite simple. The term woman is a social constructed word that society uses to deem someone when they meet certain criteria, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not talking about biological ‚Äúfemale‚Äù sex, which is defined by science, ‚Äúwoman‚Äù was defined by society, as they label colours, clothes, certain behaviours, so when people say they identify as a woman, it mean they identify as the image that the society created. \n\nThere are biological sexes, Male, Female and Intersex. \n\nAll though I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by minimum 100, could you elaborate on that?",
        "I bet they haven't seen anything describing the atrocities/crimes he committed during those times but those memes.\nThis is the reason I wish stuff like Hitler won't be shut down on social media but be told as to not let new Hitler's be born.\nAnd I honestly don't get the appeal in Patrick Bateman and hiding their feelings and stuff.bateman works best as a meme but not real life inspiration,he's literally full of insecurities himself and covers it up.\nShowing emotions and helping each other is the peak a human can be.",
        "Instagram is a bit hard but it's super easy for YouTube.\nJust watch/click videos regarding your topics and don't click on others ,do this for some time and it only shows what you want to see. But if you wanna see anything different-Incognito tab is the way.\nFor Instagram , I recommend following random pages about topics you like , save those videos(in insta save ) then like or share them and make sure most pages you follow are {topics you like to see} and then watch reels of those topics and skip any reel you don't wanna see , it might take some time but it works.",

        "Nice hypocrisy there.\n\nIn the thread about genocidal hate against Muslims in India, you try to blame Muslims themselves.\n\nHere it's the opposite.\n\nI mean I have seen loads of comments from edgy liberal/lgbt/atheists on religion calling it mental illness. But the other way around is hatred. Calls for banning propagating religion to under 18 while propagating gender ideology to under 18 is a right and banning it is genocide. Calls for keeping religion out of schools in context of hijab, but flying pride flags is okay. Okay telling Muslims to keep religion at home, but telling lgbt to keep sexuality at home is hatred\n\nThis subreddit was full of support for hijab ban by sanghis and atheists and liberals engaged gaslighting Muslims just like you did in the other thread.\n\nSince you like to do both sides nonsense and blame Muslim victims, can you tell me what's the difference between you and Andrew tate or the red pill bros?\n\nOne of your comments\n\n>I‚Äôve developed a deep sense of hatred towards Muslim men because of these reasons.\n\nTake your own gyaan which you used to gaslight Muslims. Maybe you should introspect why you are hated while you spew nonsense like \"I have a deep sense of hatred towards muslim men\"",

        "Sorry but please do research. More people are unsatisfied with their knee replacement surgery. Then transgender people are with their surgeries. \n\nAgain this is hate rhetoric on the transgender community. I live in the USA. No one is pressuring anyone to be transgender, and second of all it takes years of counseling and you can‚Äôt have surgery till your 18. Nobody wakes up and is suddenly transgender",

Live and let live.\n\n>Being Gay or abeing ny member of the LGBTQ community is a mental illness\n\nI would feel bad.\n\nBut loads of edgy atheists have done exactly that in this subreddit. Calling religion a mental illness, calls for banning teaching to under 18 and loads of other nonsense. Same with hijab bans. Loads of extremists in the subreddit supported it. Calls for keeping religion out of schools in context of hijab, but flying pride flags is okay. Okay telling Muslims to keep religion at home, but telling lgbt to keep sexuality at home is hatred\n\nAnd that's not just in a theological context. It's when Muslims have been dehumanized in India by sanghis.\n\nBut they were never banned and it's the mainstream opinion of atheists and liberals in this subreddit",

Same goes for atheists and agnostics too!\n\nHow ever being part of an LGBTQ movement is not mental illness, that‚Äôs just a brain dead and ignorant statement to make, I say ignorant because, that case is not backed up by science, it is backed in some cases, it backed my religious biases and own and fear of own acceptance of homosexual tendencies",
        "At this point i don't even bother to put my opinions because i know their sensory receptors aren't working and they're behaving like narcissitic  . So i just mind my business and stay away from such people. But it is sad that where our society is leading. We want credit from west ,we want to go to west and want west etc but when it comes to upliftment of society it's suddenly \"western influence\".Sometimes i think west doesn't hate us , throw racism on us, it's us who are like \"Aa bail mujhe maar\".",

Although I understand where you are coming from, I disagree that humanity is a huge mistake, of course it may feel as if we are all heading into the darkness, there are still angels out there, in the form of nurses, the people who take of the elderly and some people who volunteer because they can't look away, while they are still fighting to spread love and kindness, the least we could do is stop spreading hatred and despair.",

        "Nah man, the red pill gang are everywhere it is frightening, it spreads like wildfire",
        "Hmm, that is an intricate situation, I can't pretend to know more about gender dysphoria more than an average person, yet it is a rough subject because it is hard to handle, in a way, once a minor becomes a major, it makes sense for them to choose the gender they prefer to be, yet it is intricate because if the grade 7 kid said, he is gay, he is probably gay, you can't choose who you like.  \n\n\n That said, I don't think any grade 7 kid would identify as a different gender for attention or fame, specially in India and how people treat is as a taboo, if you are sure that he is not joking and actually believes it, it is best to have an open dialogue with him, as to ask why he thinks that way.   \n\n\nAgain that's what i would do.",

I make sure that I write ‚Äúsome‚Äù to ensure that people don‚Äôt take it as everybody.\n\nAs for your comment pointing out the hypocrisy, where have I shown support for banning religion or banning hijab? If you read my comments, you‚Äôd realize that all I‚Äôve been mentioning is to keep religion private, and not let it make political decisions, which is what many people want. Here too, I‚Äôve mentioned that being lgbt is their business, and not ours. Hope you read my comments properly, and not attack just because I decided ONCE to see the other side‚Äôs perspective.",
        "I just figured that it would be‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúDifferent?‚Äù. In my limited experience, I‚Äôve never heard much conversation about LGBTQ issues.\n\nHow the hell is Andrew Tate a thing in India ? That swine would most likely call all Indians as betas or some shit like that. His entire business model is manipulating and coercing women to do work for him. He‚Äôs literally being charged for human trafficking. If that doesn‚Äôt make people question their choices in life, I think there‚Äôs something really wrong with them.\n\nOne thing I‚Äôd like to add is the casual dismissal of feminism. Not only do I see examples of brash , provocative statements being falsely attributed to feminism but also the counterculture around seeping into the mainstream. Funnily enough a good chunk of these examples, caricatures that are shown are examples of toxic masculinity being reflected in women and examples of women just being really shitty.",

        "THIS !!!\n\nThe whole world is getting so screwed up üòîüòî. Social media algorithms have figured out that the most rage inducing or polarising content is what is going to get the most engagement so this problem is  only going to increase in the future.\n\nI thought reddit would be different but it's also turning into a place for people to just bash others üòê.. I don't have any other social media accounts... deleted others...because I realised it's not good for my mental health because we talk about this stuff and vent our rage over polarising content and in real life are just helping whatever apps we are using make more money.\nBelieve me at the end of the day Instagram, Facebook, reddit, and other companies are the LAST people who care about any kind of social issues üôÑüôÑ.\n\n\nLiterally hate all social media apps now which are bringing out the worst in people. Recently another redditor mentioned how this was even aggravating their clinically diagnosed anxiety by bringing up something negative constantly and they said it might be their last post / comment ever here..\n\nI think I might leave reddit too if this keeps happening :/",
        "Just keep on keeping on, Colonel!",
        "> All though I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by minimum 100, could you elaborate on that? \n\nBasically what types of crime trans converted people doing.Mostly you will get on TW by certain accounts",
        "remember, the more you spend time on internet, the more shitty people you would see. It is bad for your mental health(srsly). Increase interaction irl, and your shitty experiences will considerably decrease.People are frustruated with their lives, thats proabably why they abuse others.I personally hit my lowest in the covid time, i did not hate any caste/gender, but i was still trolling people nonetheless. Depression did a funny on me and i still havent recovered. But atleast i've stopped trolling people and almost never rude to people on the internet.Being chronically online is a surefire way to get your mental fucked.  \nedit: as for who i trolled: Tateriders, mysogynists, feminists, people who are always online(yep, the irony), religious people, people who were happier than me, etc.",

        "We are currently living in a tsunami of brain dead red-pilled wannabe Tates, who can't get married if their mommas and daddies can't arrange a marriage for them.\n\nCoincidentally, most of these zombies are the people who lack social skills to even connect with women at basic level. All they do is share \"waman\" memes, and hate women online because they could never have a meaningful relationship IRL.\n\nThey act as if \"females\" are only good for fucking(not like they are getting any action in first place), and they are just gold diggers and run after \"alpha\" men. Honestly, it's just sad they never met a self-respecting decent woman.\n\nAnd seriously, these aspire to become \"alpha\" men while obsessively following \"alpha\" Tate and Co?  That's the most \"beta\" thing dude.\n\nRant over.",

Best of all, she keeps it all to herself.",
        "Very well said OP. There's simply too much hate on social media for no reason. This religion hating on this, straights hating on gays, Masculine hating on Feminine. Like why, just live bro. Why fight? And whenever any of this topic brought up IRL, these brainwashed dumb people start physical fighting because they don't have a logical point to talk about. It's irritating now. It hard to see hate spread everywhere but staying out of it is probably the best we can do.",
        "Okay you may have misunderstood me, I mentioned Bill as a compliment and when I said Bill keeps to himself, is me referring to you saying how you have an issue and that is all, which mean the what ever the reason is you‚Äôre not deliberately trying to spread hatred. I was commending you, for having an opinion and also enough maturity to keep to your self. How ever you chose to attack which is fine, but I will have to defend. \n\n1. Why would I make short posts, when I can take my time elaborating my thoughts, if it‚Äôs waste of time to you, you don‚Äôt have to read. \n\n2. I could stop using it however, it is not just about me, I was mentioned about how people are just being wrapped into this mess, as form of bringing awareness, if I were to throw the Instagram away, I would not be raising an awareness, I‚Äôll just be a selfish dude, who only cares about himself.\n\n3. I do know there are nice folk out there, that‚Äôs my point, the nice people out is the reason why we shouldn‚Äôt give into the idea of hating each other. We need each other to survive. \n\n4. I believe I do know the difference between both of them and I might be curious why you are bringing that up. \n\n5. I mean, what she is doing sounds like a great thing! Sharing problems is a good thing instead of fighting it alone. \n\nNot every one is out there to get you friend! What I thought was a stupid/positive joke, was mistranslated into an aggressive attack. It is not.",

At the same time, you‚Äôre worried about how this sort of western world wokeism will destroy our country. Don‚Äôt wanna engage in name-calling, but either choose to be an unapologetic hater instead of pretending that you actually care about the country. If you‚Äôre that concerned, I hope you speak up about all the other things going wrong in our country too, instead of simply cherry-picking the lgbt issue, which isn‚Äôt even having any adverse effect right now.",
        "I wanna know what has made you so hateful towards women and lgbtq people? Don‚Äôt you think we‚Äôre humans too, and even if I don‚Äôt state the multiple rich women, having their own businesses, we‚Äôre still involved in several workforces? In the end, trust me, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your gender is lol, you‚Äôre indisposable in the world (just like ‚Äúhow women aren‚Äôt needed for anything imp‚Äù) because there are many who can do your job ;) \n\nJust go actually hustle, instead of insulting people based on their genders on social media. That‚Äôs never gonna take you anywhere in life.",
        "Feel free to be rude I do not mind but lgbt is a issue that will swoop you by your legs if one country doesn't destroy it early it's like a spreading cancer and no I'm not the kind of person to just bring one problem and ignore the rest. I always speak up against a cancer that is rampant which is corruption. Every party every single one is corrupt to a large extent.i only targeted the lgbt issue because sooner or later we will have to deal with it and mainly because this post didn't mention or have anything to do with the rampant issues",
        "Homosexuality has existed since the v old times, to the point that it was actually pretty normal and acceptable to be homosexual. That didn‚Äôt really hamper the population of our today‚Äôs world, right? The simple reason is the fact that it‚Äôs not a choice. Some people just end up liking people of the same sex. \n\nEven after reading and knowing sm about homosexuality, I‚Äôve not become a homosexual, simply because I‚Äôm straight. Just like how some xyz person won‚Äôt suddenly turn gay/bi/lesbian if they read more about it. We‚Äôre humans, and we realize what we like and what we don‚Äôt. Petty example, but a pure vegetarian person wouldn‚Äôt wanna eat non vegetarian simply because they heard about it lol. \n\nYour problem is here is that you think it‚Äôs something people consciously choose. But if you‚Äôd have ever bothered to listen to somebody from the lgbtq community, you‚Äôd realize that it‚Äôs not a choice for them. Since you already used to bully gay people, why do you think they‚Äôd ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to be gay? Why‚Äôd they want to make their life 10x more difficult than it already is? \n\nYou can speak up against lgbtq as much as you want, but people hiding their sexuality can become a v huge problem in itself. I‚Äôve heard of unhappy marriages, divorced couples, and lonely people just because they couldn‚Äôt come out of the closet. Try seeing the other side, and reading more about it too.",
        "Sure it might have been decent in the past.but the time for talking is now over because almost every time lgbtq spreads it brings degeneracy and failure to renew the population. Take USA for example they have failed to meet the replacement population quota that means at something during the future there will be more retired people than young and active population. It must be stopped and looking at the choices the Indian majority has made lgbtq won't be hitting us for a long time",

I don‚Äôt know what you found as propaganda from mainstream, but I have expressed, are clearly stated by him, and how is videos are output. I have seen quite a lot of his videos, his podcasts and also his war room. I came to the conclusion after doing my research on him. Yet you try to defend him with your perception of him but not facts or reasoning at the least. \n\nIf you had an addiction with gaming, it was over come by you, he didn‚Äôt cast a spell, he told you what you already know, yet take credit for your work. Which is what pisses me off about him. \n\nHomie, he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about men. You provide him a view, which generates him money, that is why, he provides shit that appeals to you, but he‚Äôs just profiting out you. If your view meant nothing, he wouldn‚Äôt give two shits about you. That‚Äôs my take anyway, in the end, if he makes you a better person, and you genuinely believe it than I am happy for you.",
        "Even in a free country like the US, the population of lgbtq people is only around 7%. \n\nIn fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure there are more than 7% of citizens who don‚Äôt wish to ever get married. You gonna beat ‚Äòem up too for not contributing to the population? Note that this decision is actually by choice*\n\nOh there are infertile people too, or those who‚Äôve fertility issues. They make up about 15-16% of the population. They‚Äôre also unable to have kids. Go ahead and beat them too.\n\nYou can go check the official stats.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Being hateful is the new edgy *Rant*",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Greeting fellow Indian homies, **Disclaimer: This post will contain some parts of discussing different religion and LGBTQ community, this is to bring up a conversation and in no way trying to attack a specific community.** I don't know about you all, I am tired and mentally exhausted looking at the hate being spread on social media platforms. Against women, lgbtq community, and peoples own perception of masculinity. I notice this mostly on social media, and occasionally from what my friends say. Whenever I open my youtube, the content that is pushed to me is the red pill community, with some brain dead dick riders, who claim that \"woman, have no hobbies!\", \"Being Gay or abeing ny member of the LGBTQ community is a mental illness\", \"Men don't have to be loyal because they can spread there seed (first of all, anytime I hear that, I want to puke), yet woman have to stay loyal to men because they can be pregnant by only one person and after that they are a bagage.\" Everytime I get this video, I choose, do not recommend, however they still pop-up. They claim to want traditional woman, who have to house wifes, shouldn't have male friends, shouldn't work but need to sign a prenup, like what kinda brain dead fuck face thinks like that. I thought people are smart enough to realize that this is crap, yeti I look at the comments and they only seemed to support it, like bruh, think for yourself. Not only that, I have been watching the content on instagram that are heavily targeting women for no reason, a clip of woman making a stupid mistake, and everyone in the comment section begins to generalise it with a comment \"women\". I get that people are just trying to make a joke, but it has stopped being a joke and became more of a instigation technique. God forbid you make a comment on men doing stupid shit and the replies from butt hurt men, who claim that is not a joke but an attack on male community, yet they can also comment \"women\" but women have to take it as a joke. The audacity. Then there any of the LGBTQ posts, even as simple as a \"Happy Pride\" post gets so much disgust and hatred as people begin to claim \"it is not part of hinduism, it is mental illness!\", \"Western Media Influence\" well my fellow hindu's, you're wrong, LGBTQ, maybe the acronym that we might have taken from the western media but the acts of homosexuality and transgenderism has been in Hinduism for a very long time. Sources: [https://academic.oup.com/book/11527/chapter-abstract/160309678?redirectedFrom=fulltext](https://academic.oup.com/book/11527/chapter-abstract/160309678?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0223.xml](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0223.xml), [https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/10-instances-of-homosexuality-among-lgbts-in-ancient-india-1281446-2018-07-10](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/10-instances-of-homosexuality-among-lgbts-in-ancient-india-1281446-2018-07-10). Like if you don't support and are repelled by the community, fine, whatever, but to go on to the posts that are catered for LGBTQ community and comment about how you are being forced to watch or endure, you can scroll past or even stop following them, instead you go to a place that was dedicated for safety for the people in community, for them to feel welcome, the haters go there to attack. How do you feel if atheists and agnostics comes to your church, your temple or your mosque and say you have mental illness for believing in an imaginary bearded man in the sky. Live and let live. Finally the Tate meat riders, the amount of people claim Andrew Tate to be a messiah and spread his words as wisdom is just so stupid. Some people follow him for his content, I get it, he is a charismatic guy, how ever, their are people who see him as role models are the biggest sheep. Like why is he a good role model? The man offers nothing but materialistic ideology and money, that is what he just sells. People forget to see how he made money, through cam sites, taking advantage of depressed men, casino's, gambling. He then preaches that he is a man of Islam and his principles are based off of Quran, I will admit my knowledge about the Quran is limited, still I do know it condones, alcohol and gambling, to him, he is just using the religion as a cover to hide his bad influences. I don't care if people drink or not, but claiming to a man of god, yet indulging in sin, is a great indicator that they are a hypocrite. At the end of the day, he is a clout chaser, and I wish he just admits it and his fans stop treating him like Morpheus who is giving them a way out of the matrix. I say this again, I get that people have freedom to watch what they please, nothing wrong with that, but all the content that we consume nowadays are just generating hate and dividing the communities for no reason, there's no need to be a battle between sexes, all of us are co dependent, we can't claim \"God, I hate people!\", \"People Suck\" without even putting an effort to even be kind to each other. We can't find kindness anywhere, if we are lucky, we bump into angels of a people, that remind us that kind people exist. Not all of us are privileged to have kind people around. So let's just be kind, and nice to each other, even if our opinions differ.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Yeah, there's a lot of garbage out there. Internet provides the power to amplify both good and bad. I agree with you, what scares me is that the amount parents have no issues giving their kids iPads, who will have access to hateful stuff, they might thinks it‚Äôs cool or whatever but I worry for the future, it‚Äôs like people treat being kind is some sort of a weakness There are kid safe websites, filters, apps etc. It's upto the parent to setup restrictions. But yes, even when you do that, they can be exposed to harmful things sometimes. Although IMO, the topic you're talking about is more relevant to adults. UR USERNAME FEELS LIKE HOME leaving social media bec i wanna be productive :( leaving social media to stay away from edgy people :DDD What you said is true, it is more relevant to adults, I mean who are adults anyways, just some giant sized children. To add on, it the teens that I worry about too! Adolescents can make teens feel as if being rebellious is cool and right, I mean I thought that I went through it, but I had some good guidance to help me navigate. Yes ikr, it‚Äôs so exhausting. I really don‚Äôt understand the hate towards lgbtq. It‚Äôs seen as this grave sin, or as something disgusting by most people. I just don‚Äôt get that even if your faith/cultural values doesn‚Äôt allow homosexuality, why is it your business? You follow your faith and traditions, and let others follow theirs lol. Plus, the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs unnatural, we need babies‚Äù argument is so stupid. Majority of the world is straight, hell, we‚Äôre still having overpopulation crisis atleast in some countries lol. Imagine if all straight people suddenty turned gay for some short time, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be quick to take away all their harsh views, considering the fact that it‚Äôs not a choice that people make. :/ And don‚Äôt get me started on those red pill bros! I‚Äôm so exhausted of them. I just block those accounts, and live peacefully knowing that there are some idiots out there who‚Äôd never achieve true enlightenment, and I shouldn‚Äôt waste my time on them :) I agree with you, I can't tell you how much it rages me, when certain religious groups acts oppressed, like they haven‚Äôt stoned, electrocuted and murdered people for just existing as part of an LGBTQ community. The red pill bros are worse for sure, but the red pill \"Pick me\" girls are even worse \"I don't think women should have the right to vote\" like bitch! Go and read a book! I‚Äôm a part of that religious groupüíÄ so pls don‚Äôt generalize, but I get your sentiment. Yes ik, it sucks to see women hating on women. Like hey, if we don‚Äôt hold onto each other, who will? :/ Of course, I didn‚Äôt mean to generalise, I used it as a broad term instead of targeting any specific religion but I understand and agree with your point. And have you noticed how they bring some really uneducated girls to these podcasts and videos? I‚Äôve seen so many people point out this hypocrisy, that they should be bringing actually learned women for discussions. But ofc they won‚Äôt because we all know what‚Äôd happen lol :) Oh god yes! It is sad to see, I don‚Äôt understand my these women go onto these podcasts only to get shit on by dudes whose whole personality is like a tuna can. Internalized misogyny - that‚Äôs the term for it. I don‚Äôt hate those women, I just feel sad for them sometimes, because they still attach their self-worth and existence to a man, instead of their ownselves. I hope they break free out of it, because in the end, we‚Äôre humans, and deserve some level of equality Very true! I hate everyone equally. I am a misanthrope. I think you also mis sed my point lol Squidward? the ‚Äòwomen ‚òïÔ∏è‚Äô comments are so saddening man it‚Äôs insane lmao Can we get a TLDR for long rants? Don‚Äôt forget that reddit itself is a hub for such assholes. The gender ratio here is so bad (especially on indian subs) that even if you as a women say something slightly opinionated regarding men , the whole mass of incel comments would be flooded in your inbox because it‚Äôs that easy. Internet anonymity has given liberty to such people to bully and pass hateful comments with no consequences whatsoever.Someone said that every subreddit has a mass of people that are the echo chambers of a certain issue. Misogyny, making homophobic ‚Äúdank‚Äù comments, passing sexual remarks on women, is THE ISSUE of such subreddits. i mean muslims are pretty oppressed in india, but obviously no excuse for lgbtq oppression Tldr: social media platforms are filled with hateful poop people. Is being gay a case of nature or nurture? Either way it's beyond that person's control, no point in hating and discriminating folks for it. If they start to become a pain in your ass, you can choose to fight them...or use a better lube Everytime I see women ‚òï, I literally want to throw my phone away. I'm a guy and guys do make mistakes too. You said exactly what I always think OP, thank you for putting into words. This is the only reason why I deactivated my Instagram and really don't want to get back into it anytime soon. Seeing people like this makes me sooo scared. It's sad and pathetic to see this hatred. Such intolerance, so much negativity, and the comment section is so disgusting for many posts. Someone makes a valid point and they are called names. Like people's first instinct in comments is to abuse others rather than logically talking or saying. It's messed up Wow you're so cool They had a good run when they were used for harmless fun. Now they just turned into an insult that insecure incels use. It is sad, the young men are being influenced to think that there is a war between sexes, where is not a battle, we are trying to survive and we need each other. Sad to see many man completely disregard feminism as a western propaganda and it spreads hate against men, when it is not the case. Yeah, As a guy I understand, sometimes I just think people want others to this what they say is funny, only needs to be taken as funny joke, even if what said is a direct attack on a person. Humor requires thinking skills, can't attack/bully a person and them regard that as a joke. Lmao! Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half NO THIS IS PATRICK!! Thanks homie! The comment section has gone toxic, filled with people who want fake validation from other fake internet people, being different makes you unique, so hate things that people love. It's just a way of expressing their own self worth and insecurities I guess, when they try to bring people down for enjoying something. When asked why speak if they didn't like it, they say \"It's my opinion, get over it!\", that's calling a new born baby ugly for no reason and when the pissed of parents ask \"why\", 'Cuz duh! I have free speech!\". It is indeed sad Saw this comment section. A Muslim guy did great in neet ug like scored a rank in 3 digits and topped like the entire north east. Oh my god the comments. They were all targetting his religion. I was shocked. Nobody was congratulating him. It was a war in the comments. The Muslims were acting like he won for the community and the Hindus were just... Idk man. It's sick. Everyone is retarded at this point. That is sad, everyone one are being influenced to hate, they are being taught to generalize which and false patriotic self imposed values that make them want to hate anyone that doesn't belong to a particular community. It is sad. Dark humour stopped being funny when everyone started to try it. Saying kill all gay people lol is not funny. I have been so tired of all that toxic stuff that i actively filtered my feed to only show cat videos and my other hobbies(like gaming,shows etc ) but Indian Instagram community is extremely toxic by this 12 year old wannabe chads \"Kill all Gays\" \"Bruh it's just a joke bruh\" \"what's the joke you ask?\" \"Like all gays will be killed duh!\" \"see so funny!\" That is a very healthy way of navigating social media! The wanna be chads don't understand that their whole person is built on hiding their feelings and projecting their insecurities on others. It is sad, I heard a 10 class kid, I met at a function say to me, that he and his friends think \"Hitler is in the right! He should be idolized\" That in itself terrified me, as it left me wondering as of what are these kids latching onto these days. hijacking the top comment to provide a response for 'women ‚òïÔ∏è' and that is 'Men üçº' Please use this women, whenever you get trolled. Peace. it was never harmless for women I can see that, being in the opposite sex kinda makes me forget to notice things at times. I reallyyyyy tried to change my alogirthm for the posts and the discover feed, but the reels I never want to see always pop up. I had to ask a friend not to send me certain memes and stuff. Good Ol Pearly, believes woman shouldn‚Äôt have right, woman likes to get cheated on and they are the biggest reason for the fall of society. I just say thanks for the coffee, wash it when I'm done lmao Ikr. She's the biggest pick me I've ever seen üòÇ and funny enough there was a video in which she Said: I'd rather be a pick me then a skip me . I mean ab iske baad kya he expect karsakte hai isse Omg so truuue! She is soo insufferable, She is just a clout chaser, she doesn‚Äôt care about any of her listeners, all she cares about is saying the same thing other red pill podcast say Ok. KO. I dont mind lesbians & gays living but when it comes trans converted people,i think they should be transitioned without any forced group by a 3rd party or parents. Let the child be 18+ age first to decide whether man wants to convert into woman or woman into a man. I do have to watch the documentary **Matt** provided which gives me the topic into \"Agree-Disagree' both ways. I do have to see the track record of these people what type of fruitcakery they are doing globally.Minimum 100 is required. I know i will get disagreements but hey at least i am keeping it civil here mate :) Have a good sunday! I get when you are coming from, especially when it comes to Transgender movement, not a lot of people understand it, lot of people are scared to talk about or question it, because they fear they will be labelled as a transphobe. The whole subject of Gender dus photos is not topic for sure, as the first case dates back to the 19th century: That said, it makes sense of what you propose, lot of people are now aware of this due to social media and most of the cases that goes viral seemed to be the bad cases that are used in the echo chambers. It is still a subject that is being discussed, which is interesting because there is a lot of gender change in Thailand for example and there is a huge acceptance of them over there. I also know the documentary you are talking about, the one with Matt Walsh I‚Äôm assuming, I generally don‚Äôt like the guy, and his documentary ‚ÄúWhat is a woman‚Äù was a head ache to go through, I have no idea why the people who he chose to debate, couldn‚Äôt even answer a simple question of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs is a woman‚Äù, especially where there is gender science professor sitting in front him. His logic is biased from bible and can countered a lot. He claims, woman are the ones that can get pregnant as that it what it states in the Bible, yet it can be tackled with ‚Äúwhat about women that are infertile‚Äù. I think the answer to ‚Äúwhat is a woman‚Äù is quite simple. The term woman is a social constructed word that society uses to deem someone when they meet certain criteria, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not talking about biological ‚Äúfemale‚Äù sex, which is defined by science, ‚Äúwoman‚Äù was defined by society, as they label colours, clothes, certain behaviours, so when people say they identify as a woman, it mean they identify as the image that the society created. There are biological sexes, Male, Female and Intersex. All though I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by minimum 100, could you elaborate on that? I bet they haven't seen anything describing the atrocities/crimes he committed during those times but those memes. This is the reason I wish stuff like Hitler won't be shut down on social media but be told as to not let new Hitler's be born. And I honestly don't get the appeal in Patrick Bateman and hiding their feelings and stuff.bateman works best as a meme but not real life inspiration,he's literally full of insecurities himself and covers it up. Showing emotions and helping each other is the peak a human can be. Instagram is a bit hard but it's super easy for YouTube. Just watch/click videos regarding your topics and don't click on others ,do this for some time and it only shows what you want to see. But if you wanna see anything different-Incognito tab is the way. For Instagram , I recommend following random pages about topics you like , save those videos(in insta save ) then like or share them and make sure most pages you follow are {topics you like to see} and then watch reels of those topics and skip any reel you don't wanna see , it might take some time but it works. In most countries its illegal to transition before you turn 18 and I dont really think anyone is pressuring anyone to be trans considering how much transphobic the world is. This one is quite witty lol Nice hypocrisy there. In the thread about genocidal hate against Muslims in India, you try to blame Muslims themselves. Here it's the opposite. I mean I have seen loads of comments from edgy liberal/lgbt/atheists on religion calling it mental illness. But the other way around is hatred. Calls for banning propagating religion to under 18 while propagating gender ideology to under 18 is a right and banning it is genocide. Calls for keeping religion out of schools in context of hijab, but flying pride flags is okay. Okay telling Muslims to keep religion at home, but telling lgbt to keep sexuality at home is hatred This subreddit was full of support for hijab ban by sanghis and atheists and liberals engaged gaslighting Muslims just like you did in the other thread. Since you like to do both sides nonsense and blame Muslim victims, can you tell me what's the difference between you and Andrew tate or the red pill bros? One of your comments >I‚Äôve developed a deep sense of hatred towards Muslim men because of these reasons. Take your own gyaan which you used to gaslight Muslims. Maybe you should introspect why you are hated while you spew nonsense like \"I have a deep sense of hatred towards muslim men\" Thank you! Sorry but please do research. More people are unsatisfied with their knee replacement surgery. Then transgender people are with their surgeries. Again this is hate rhetoric on the transgender community. I live in the USA. No one is pressuring anyone to be transgender, and second of all it takes years of counseling and you can‚Äôt have surgery till your 18. Nobody wakes up and is suddenly transgender >. How do you feel if atheists and agnostics comes to your church, your temple or your mosque and say you have mental illness for believing in an imaginary bearded man in the sky. Live and let live. >Being Gay or abeing ny member of the LGBTQ community is a mental illness I would feel bad. But loads of edgy atheists have done exactly that in this subreddit. Calling religion a mental illness, calls for banning teaching to under 18 and loads of other nonsense. Same with hijab bans. Loads of extremists in the subreddit supported it. Calls for keeping religion out of schools in context of hijab, but flying pride flags is okay. Okay telling Muslims to keep religion at home, but telling lgbt to keep sexuality at home is hatred And that's not just in a theological context. It's when Muslims have been dehumanized in India by sanghis. But they were never banned and it's the mainstream opinion of atheists and liberals in this subreddit What's wrong with generalization? I mean here's one of your comment >I‚Äôve developed a deep sense of hatred towards Muslim men because of these reasons. Bro make new account and follow better content, it will stop Best idea anyone has given me by far Absolutely, Most of the edge lord, finds a sense of power and moral superiority when they begin to stop believing in god. How ever, irrespective of the religion, my point is to be nice to everyone, if you don‚Äôt support it, move on, you have your own life to worry about. Same goes for atheists and agnostics too! How ever being part of an LGBTQ movement is not mental illness, that‚Äôs just a brain dead and ignorant statement to make, I say ignorant because, that case is not backed up by science, it is backed in some cases, it backed my religious biases and own and fear of own acceptance of homosexual tendencies At this point i don't even bother to put my opinions because i know their sensory receptors aren't working and they're behaving like narcissitic . So i just mind my business and stay away from such people. But it is sad that where our society is leading. We want credit from west ,we want to go to west and want west etc but when it comes to upliftment of society it's suddenly \"western influence\".Sometimes i think west doesn't hate us , throw racism on us, it's us who are like \"Aa bail mujhe maar\". This all was ironically started as a simple satirical joke \"sigma\" and many incels have invaded and ruined it by taking it seriously. Misogyny, Homophobia is so normalized in Instagram comments these days. Thanks for making this post OP At this point i am just waiting for a nuclear apocalypse to kill us all man or God themselves show up and kill us all. Humanity is a huge mistake Thank you! I will try this Nah my friend! Although I understand where you are coming from, I disagree that humanity is a huge mistake, of course it may feel as if we are all heading into the darkness, there are still angels out there, in the form of nurses, the people who take of the elderly and some people who volunteer because they can't look away, while they are still fighting to spread love and kindness, the least we could do is stop spreading hatred and despair. there is a \" women üëë\" too I didn‚Äôt realize that this is the red pill content that‚Äôs being push in Indian social media. I thought this was the case primarily in the US. Damn, the algorithm is super screwed up. I have no issue with LGBTQ+ but I have issue when it starts involving minors, someone I knew was in grade 7, and he identifies as she/her, that was my turning point, I don't care if a grown up adult decides to be gay/lesbian or anything he/she/they wish to be but I also don't like that minors start following the same trend. Tate is BS, he just fills the user with Red pill so much that they crave more of it every now and then, presenting always one sided facts how woman cheat, how women will leave you for this and that, all nonsense based on some rare cases, his thinking is not even valid with Indian society. Nah man, the red pill gang are everywhere it is frightening, it spreads like wildfire Hmm, that is an intricate situation, I can't pretend to know more about gender dysphoria more than an average person, yet it is a rough subject because it is hard to handle, in a way, once a minor becomes a major, it makes sense for them to choose the gender they prefer to be, yet it is intricate because if the grade 7 kid said, he is gay, he is probably gay, you can't choose who you like. That said, I don't think any grade 7 kid would identify as a different gender for attention or fame, specially in India and how people treat is as a taboo, if you are sure that he is not joking and actually believes it, it is best to have an open dialogue with him, as to ask why he thinks that way. Again that's what i would do. I always tell this quote by bertand russell to children nowadays: love is wise, hatred is foolish. It wasnt the case an year ago. Yeah there were guys doing weird shit but not to this extent. Ever since Tate and all this characters like Bateman became super famous, things went out of hand. I‚Äôve got nothing to say to you, because you don‚Äôt know me, and I‚Äôve my reasons. Even the post/comment you‚Äôre talking about, I‚Äôve always emphasized on the word ‚Äúsome‚Äù. I make sure that I write ‚Äúsome‚Äù to ensure that people don‚Äôt take it as everybody. As for your comment pointing out the hypocrisy, where have I shown support for banning religion or banning hijab? If you read my comments, you‚Äôd realize that all I‚Äôve been mentioning is to keep religion private, and not let it make political decisions, which is what many people want. Here too, I‚Äôve mentioned that being lgbt is their business, and not ours. Hope you read my comments properly, and not attack just because I decided ONCE to see the other side‚Äôs perspective. I just figured that it would be‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúDifferent?‚Äù. In my limited experience, I‚Äôve never heard much conversation about LGBTQ issues. How the hell is Andrew Tate a thing in India ? That swine would most likely call all Indians as betas or some shit like that. His entire business model is manipulating and coercing women to do work for him. He‚Äôs literally being charged for human trafficking. If that doesn‚Äôt make people question their choices in life, I think there‚Äôs something really wrong with them. One thing I‚Äôd like to add is the casual dismissal of feminism. Not only do I see examples of brash , provocative statements being falsely attributed to feminism but also the counterculture around seeping into the mainstream. Funnily enough a good chunk of these examples, caricatures that are shown are examples of toxic masculinity being reflected in women and examples of women just being really shitty. Funny how only a specific type of hate is targeted here I‚Äôve seen this a lot too! I know it‚Äôs rude but I don‚Äôt know how. Can someone please explain what this means? Ayyyyyyy üòÖ THIS !!! The whole world is getting so screwed up üòîüòî. Social media algorithms have figured out that the most rage inducing or polarising content is what is going to get the most engagement so this problem is only going to increase in the future. I thought reddit would be different but it's also turning into a place for people to just bash others üòê.. I don't have any other social media accounts... deleted others...because I realised it's not good for my mental health because we talk about this stuff and vent our rage over polarising content and in real life are just helping whatever apps we are using make more money. Believe me at the end of the day Instagram, Facebook, reddit, and other companies are the LAST people who care about any kind of social issues üôÑüôÑ. Literally hate all social media apps now which are bringing out the worst in people. Recently another redditor mentioned how this was even aggravating their clinically diagnosed anxiety by bringing up something negative constantly and they said it might be their last post / comment ever here.. I think I might leave reddit too if this keeps happening :/ Just keep on keeping on, Colonel! > All though I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by minimum 100, could you elaborate on that? Basically what types of crime trans converted people doing.Mostly you will get on TW by certain accounts remember, the more you spend time on internet, the more shitty people you would see. It is bad for your mental health(srsly). Increase interaction irl, and your shitty experiences will considerably decrease.People are frustruated with their lives, thats proabably why they abuse others.I personally hit my lowest in the covid time, i did not hate any caste/gender, but i was still trolling people nonetheless. Depression did a funny on me and i still havent recovered. But atleast i've stopped trolling people and almost never rude to people on the internet.Being chronically online is a surefire way to get your mental fucked. edit: as for who i trolled: Tateriders, mysogynists, feminists, people who are always online(yep, the irony), religious people, people who were happier than me, etc. Dark humour stopped being funny when it just became dark and no humour We are currently living in a tsunami of brain dead red-pilled wannabe Tates, who can't get married if their mommas and daddies can't arrange a marriage for them. Coincidentally, most of these zombies are the people who lack social skills to even connect with women at basic level. All they do is share \"waman\" memes, and hate women online because they could never have a meaningful relationship IRL. They act as if \"females\" are only good for fucking(not like they are getting any action in first place), and they are just gold diggers and run after \"alpha\" men. Honestly, it's just sad they never met a self-respecting decent woman. And seriously, these aspire to become \"alpha\" men while obsessively following \"alpha\" Tate and Co? That's the most \"beta\" thing dude. Rant over. I have seen both but to my understanding the second one is more prominent than women. Men are just insecure that they take out their anger against women these days. They don't have their own family or can't make one. About LGBTQ I don't post comments but I disregard pride month. Unfortunately \"Good\" never spreads like Wildfire. Be like Bill. 1. He is updated 2. He is opinionated 3. Best of all, he keep it all to himself! Yeah I ain't going to hurt you but you can follow Jill also. 1. She knows how to make short posts. 2. She stops using ig if it's toxic. 3. She know there are positive audiences out there. 4. She knows the difference between a reply and an opinion. 5. She tells people to face if she has a problem. 6. Best of all, she keeps it all to herself. Very well said OP. There's simply too much hate on social media for no reason. This religion hating on this, straights hating on gays, Masculine hating on Feminine. Like why, just live bro. Why fight? And whenever any of this topic brought up IRL, these brainwashed dumb people start physical fighting because they don't have a logical point to talk about. It's irritating now. It hard to see hate spread everywhere but staying out of it is probably the best we can do. Okay you may have misunderstood me, I mentioned Bill as a compliment and when I said Bill keeps to himself, is me referring to you saying how you have an issue and that is all, which mean the what ever the reason is you‚Äôre not deliberately trying to spread hatred. I was commending you, for having an opinion and also enough maturity to keep to your self. How ever you chose to attack which is fine, but I will have to defend. 1. Why would I make short posts, when I can take my time elaborating my thoughts, if it‚Äôs waste of time to you, you don‚Äôt have to read. 2. I could stop using it however, it is not just about me, I was mentioned about how people are just being wrapped into this mess, as form of bringing awareness, if I were to throw the Instagram away, I would not be raising an awareness, I‚Äôll just be a selfish dude, who only cares about himself. 3. I do know there are nice folk out there, that‚Äôs my point, the nice people out is the reason why we shouldn‚Äôt give into the idea of hating each other. We need each other to survive. 4. I believe I do know the difference between both of them and I might be curious why you are bringing that up. 5. I mean, what she is doing sounds like a great thing! Sharing problems is a good thing instead of fighting it alone. Not every one is out there to get you friend! What I thought was a stupid/positive joke, was mistranslated into an aggressive attack. It is not. Yeah but sometimes in sea of violence and aggression you can't just help but lost hope sometimes and become apathetic i am trying to work myself on it. I swear i keep falling backwards more and more Just keep on keeping on friend! At the end of the day, it is you who will have to take care of yourself, you need to make sure you are okay, before you care for the others. Sure go ahead but this won't change a thing we will continue to spread hate liberty is not a option Money is everything that matters you want safety from thugs that run india outside of urban areas you need money materialistic is now fundamental those that don't support it are not capable of living outside of a crammed 300 apartment building Women have tried to use this on me but most of the time they can't find points to fight the keyboard war so they end up getting called ugly fat unwanted bitches who can't walk alone at night and leave Yeah I thought that was some comeback and required time for my organization to put malware on the females online profile and leak private information to shut them up or just harass them so we switched to dishwasher ‚òïÔ∏è There needs to be no reason I have made it my task to attack any lgbtq person even in my school days we used to beat up the gay kid daily inside the toilets Oh wow, beating someone because of who they choose to like, that‚Äôs so cool!!!!!!!!!! <3 Of course Especially when their choice of life is wrong and it just feels right they end up getting called? or you call them this? and are we assuming men are not ugly or fat or unwanted or dogs? The only aspect is that they still can walk alone at night? Perhaps you never debated with a strong woman Even if it were wrong (which btw it isn‚Äôt), I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve not been beaten by random people lol, for your wrong life choices :D It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong anymore I have done a good job making people around me believe I'm right. Which I am we do not need lower younger population wokism has only brought stains in countries And the majority of India even the youngsters believe the same .Victory is near Strong in what? Keyboard fights? Even a relatively fat person with low muscle could grab a fit female and take her Women aren't needed for anything but reproduction they don't serve no important job .The richest women made it from divorce. Creatures with over inflated egos that were born for the purpose of riding dicks ü§£ü§£ That is a nice response since it shows how females are already practicing to take dicks in their mouth because the coffee means the men drink it when women are doing their classic shenanigans.So it's fair that women in return are practicing sucking cocks I get all I need to know about you with that propaganda mainstream view.sure his past might have been bad but without him id never have quit video games and start working more for that grind.He only promotes men to be strong not blatant hate. You are contradicting yourself. You‚Äôre making others believe that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right‚Äù which probably feeds your empty soul, without even knowing if something‚Äôs wrong/right. At the same time, you‚Äôre worried about how this sort of western world wokeism will destroy our country. Don‚Äôt wanna engage in name-calling, but either choose to be an unapologetic hater instead of pretending that you actually care about the country. If you‚Äôre that concerned, I hope you speak up about all the other things going wrong in our country too, instead of simply cherry-picking the lgbt issue, which isn‚Äôt even having any adverse effect right now. I wanna know what has made you so hateful towards women and lgbtq people? Don‚Äôt you think we‚Äôre humans too, and even if I don‚Äôt state the multiple rich women, having their own businesses, we‚Äôre still involved in several workforces? In the end, trust me, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your gender is lol, you‚Äôre indisposable in the world (just like ‚Äúhow women aren‚Äôt needed for anything imp‚Äù) because there are many who can do your job ;) Just go actually hustle, instead of insulting people based on their genders on social media. That‚Äôs never gonna take you anywhere in life. Feel free to be rude I do not mind but lgbt is a issue that will swoop you by your legs if one country doesn't destroy it early it's like a spreading cancer and no I'm not the kind of person to just bring one problem and ignore the rest. I always speak up against a cancer that is rampant which is corruption. Every party every single one is corrupt to a large extent.i only targeted the lgbt issue because sooner or later we will have to deal with it and mainly because this post didn't mention or have anything to do with the rampant issues Homosexuality has existed since the v old times, to the point that it was actually pretty normal and acceptable to be homosexual. That didn‚Äôt really hamper the population of our today‚Äôs world, right? The simple reason is the fact that it‚Äôs not a choice. Some people just end up liking people of the same sex. Even after reading and knowing sm about homosexuality, I‚Äôve not become a homosexual, simply because I‚Äôm straight. Just like how some xyz person won‚Äôt suddenly turn gay/bi/lesbian if they read more about it. We‚Äôre humans, and we realize what we like and what we don‚Äôt. Petty example, but a pure vegetarian person wouldn‚Äôt wanna eat non vegetarian simply because they heard about it lol. Your problem is here is that you think it‚Äôs something people consciously choose. But if you‚Äôd have ever bothered to listen to somebody from the lgbtq community, you‚Äôd realize that it‚Äôs not a choice for them. Since you already used to bully gay people, why do you think they‚Äôd ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to be gay? Why‚Äôd they want to make their life 10x more difficult than it already is? You can speak up against lgbtq as much as you want, but people hiding their sexuality can become a v huge problem in itself. I‚Äôve heard of unhappy marriages, divorced couples, and lonely people just because they couldn‚Äôt come out of the closet. Try seeing the other side, and reading more about it too. Sure it might have been decent in the past.but the time for talking is now over because almost every time lgbtq spreads it brings degeneracy and failure to renew the population. Take USA for example they have failed to meet the replacement population quota that means at something during the future there will be more retired people than young and active population. It must be stopped and looking at the choices the Indian majority has made lgbtq won't be hitting us for a long time Nice, glad you chose the path of high road and civil discussion. I don‚Äôt know what you found as propaganda from mainstream, but I have expressed, are clearly stated by him, and how is videos are output. I have seen quite a lot of his videos, his podcasts and also his war room. I came to the conclusion after doing my research on him. Yet you try to defend him with your perception of him but not facts or reasoning at the least. If you had an addiction with gaming, it was over come by you, he didn‚Äôt cast a spell, he told you what you already know, yet take credit for your work. Which is what pisses me off about him. Homie, he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about men. You provide him a view, which generates him money, that is why, he provides shit that appeals to you, but he‚Äôs just profiting out you. If your view meant nothing, he wouldn‚Äôt give two shits about you. That‚Äôs my take anyway, in the end, if he makes you a better person, and you genuinely believe it than I am happy for you. Even in a free country like the US, the population of lgbtq people is only around 7%. In fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure there are more than 7% of citizens who don‚Äôt wish to ever get married. You gonna beat ‚Äòem up too for not contributing to the population? Note that this decision is actually by choice* Oh there are infertile people too, or those who‚Äôve fertility issues. They make up about 15-16% of the population. They‚Äôre also unable to have kids. Go ahead and beat them too. You can go check the official stats. no it just means men like you are still sucking their mommies boobies same for men then why did you mention keyboard wars... choose your battles. Stop being so dumb"
