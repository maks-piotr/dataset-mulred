Holy hell How else you gonna control the population? Once a wise man said \" The matrix is trying to control your mind. It's trying to make you weak. Taking control off of yourself\". Fourth word. Darwin. What? Only problem is that it could endanger others due to stupid bike, car stunts The thing used to be the same with selfies when smartphones became accessible. Zeroth word: Dopamine addiction. I sometimes wonder Are news is even real? I mean WHO TF!! SELLS THEIR 8 MONTH OLD KID FOR AN I PHONE!!!!!! Us writing comments on reddit is for 'validation' as well. So we can see the upvotes, replies from others, get some attention, etc. Most things we do is for validation clout is one helluva drug Oh well, this is the beginning of Blackmirror: Nosedive. I was pretty addicted to reels, I'm glad I understood early and left the platform for good. The person must be a maniac. He/she can get more money by showing kids personal life in YouTube. It's generational decay that's going on. The real endemic started when everyone was given access to cheap and fast internet. We're just starting to witness the effects. Nope, defination of validation being used by you is wrong. natural selection fifth word. chutiyapa Just let Darwin's theory do its work ... Good. Revised natural selection. People with zero survival instinct and a hunger for clout deserve this Stupid people do stupid shit, Instagram has nothing to do with it. Validation on a platform where others don't even know who I am, nor do I know who they are? Natural selection Tiktok garbage has move on to Instagram and YouTube shorts. If we could start a petition to ban Instagram reels and YouTube shorts(feature) maybe it will do. Yup. That's how human psychology works. We even choose our anonymous usernames for a slight validation. Even reddit upvotes give the sort of same validation and instant gratification as any other social media. I chose the first username they showed. Am I not human? well iphone prices are increased /s Darwin awards recipients. Hope that atleast they kill only themselves without affecting anyone else. When we write a comment, we are doing it to validate our thoughts with others and see what others think about it. Natural selection Par uske liye toh pahle IIT clear karke piolet banna padega I'm simply saying even that becomes a factor of hunting validation. It's not a protocol or rule. We are content creators as well since we are publishing/uploading our comments, getting upvotes, views, replies. Just that our content is on a very small scale and anonymous. If you view from such a micro pov. Then every object around you seems to claim a life. Same thing happened when instagram selfies were becoming popular and the same thing also happened when Pokemon Go was released. The problem is the idiots not the technology. I wish everyone could get this reference haha. CarryMinati ka naam suna hai? Pura tiktok gira diya bhai ne akele. Ab woh wise man jail me hai. Chutyo ka example mat de. Reels are going to destroy an entire generation and India can't lose any more people. The thing is India has the auntie culture where they love gossip and love filling their minds with low quality information to have something to gossip about with other aunties. So reels will fit perfectly here. Bad info, fake news, incomplete stories to gossip about and pretend to be worldly. they can always get new one /s Not the compilation of news we need but... \"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day...\" Sixth word. Loda Lassun This kind of thing is bound to happen and repeat. Most of us have amnesia, lest we forget the pandemic of selfies. When selfies became a thing for the first time, there were similar reports of deaths/accidents in clicking the most daring and different selfies. The same shit happened with TikTok, which the Indian Government banned. Death and accidents. Then YouTube came up with shorts, and IG reels have taken over too. People will do anything to flow with the trend and up the game, even if it means having a meal of your puke and shit with pee as the drink of choice. And before anyone does this, please do not do this, this is a joke. Natural selection Seventh word: idiots Teach a man to fuck and his iPhone needs are set for life Nation? I would say the world tbh Nope, it gets worse, apparently the father had tried to sell their 7 yr old daughter previously but the deal fell through. Basically a couple of addicts, switch the idea of phone/reel with drugs and it makes sense. Dhoni ko tribute bhi dena padega Reels is not the problem, people doing stupid stuff on reels/for reels is the problem OP Please google the word endemic One word natural selection, now only people can see these easily. Natural selection. Yes, people were doing such things earlier, but they were not trying to imitate others on such a large scale which is made possible by these platforms. People do things without knowing the risks involved in it. 'Blue whale' wouldn't have spread earlier. So these platforms should take measures to stop such things. No, the beti bech aur ameer ho meme just got revivee Same vibe as \"guns don't kill people, people kill people\" Natural selection I‚Äôm sorry but the selling 8 year old one is funny xD Eighth word : Retards. Darwin must be proud Natural selection Ninth word: Depression On the one hand, you feel bad that young people are needlessly getting hurt/dying. On the other, you toast Darwin and move on Tenth word: india Social media validation is all many seek. Psychology says this is communicable. This is my favourite. I was checking in the comment if someone has already said it. I see all this as dumb guy leaving the world to make it a better place. RIP all those who died. You all made a great example for all the other who would follow. &#x200B; Now, before anyone starts getting angry, I am just joking. (unless I am not) Social media, smartphones, and internet‚Äî the poisoned chalice being easily available to everyone nowadays is the catalyst. Narcissism is the reason. People want quick self gratification, and they will do anything for it. As a result, some end up being total nuisance to others and rarely (if ever) learn the lesson, some, unfortunately learn it in the most expensive way possible. As long as technology keeps catering to people‚Äôs narcissism, this will go on. \"Insta-death\" yep. before reels it was selfies This feels like r/2asia4u r/darwinawards It did, then reels came along. Such degenerates don't even deserve to live Eleventh word: Cccombo Brrreaker Natural selection at it‚Äôs peak What even was blue whale Kya hai ye? Fr?? Yep. That is how it works and I understood it years ago. Whenever I sign up on any social media, I curately search for things I like. My social media is full of fitness, anatomy, physiotherapy, dermatology, experiements and pranks stuff. I don't even see a single political or religious content anymore from any country at all unless I specifically search for it which I only do like once a month, so not enough for algorithms to start throwing me that kind of content. Trust me life is easier atleast when I'm on the phone that way Ek do baari videos dekhi h uski. Bhot bolta h bhai woh. Aisa kya kia usne ki tikok gira dia? Eleventh word : China God is improvising, As modern science is capable of making vaccine and cure for complex viruses and diseases but not for reels and tiktok kind of crap. As long as these brainless idiots bring harm to themselves, it is all fine. But in the process, if an innocent gets hurt or dies (a news above), then fck these idiots and they should be tried under sections of murder (i.e. if they are alive after doing those stunts) The bigger issue is that you are wasting an incredible amount of time scrolling through this shit. Social media causes issues but it's not magic. Stuff like this has always happened, you're just being bombarded by it instead of more important matters Natural Selection People were being stupid before the reels and internet too. Reels has given people an additional reason to be stupid and internet has given us access to their stupidity. Eleventh word: Free Internet Jio was a mistake They picked insta reels over their child!?!?! Social media is one of the worst things that has happened to humans. No. just no. this is a tale old as time. yall think that our anestors did not do stupid shit just for shits and giggles? what is really telling is that it is National news when someone falls Darwin Award Candidates. It's making you feel down because many commoners have migrated from tiktok to reels. This is nothing but elitism To be considered unemployed you need to be looking for a job but can‚Äôt find one. I don‚Äôt think these people are even looking Natural selection Twelvth Word: Moh Maya You call that nuisance , I call that natural selection. Fourteenth word: common sense Natural selection Never been on any social media except Twitter and Reddit; this Insta thing always scared the shit out of me ü•≤ All thanks to those youtube videos ‚ÄúGhar baithe kamaye laakho sirf reels/shorts se‚Äù plus the dirt cheap internet. Lol ‚Äúdon‚Äôt blame the guns, blame the people‚Äù Forget that Instagram SHOULD be blamed for dark patterns Hiw the f do you sell a baby? Sarojini mai to nahi hota and it has nearly everything. Its two words Banaya tha ek video, woh takedown hogya lekin fir bhi mil jayega. Uska latest wala jarur dekhna, accha banaya hai. I think words 5-8 sums it up perfectly"
