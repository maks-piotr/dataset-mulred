This literally was my motivating factor to decide to pursue higher studies in the US and I gave my everything as it was a do or die for me. \n\nMumbai is not all bad though. The hustle culture trains you to be a very driven person. The drive could as well be to get away from Mumbai but it inspires you. No where in the world have I seen so many driven people working so so hard. This city has the best access to education, training and any other support you need for your career. Moving to Mumbai was essential for me to get access to top Class GRE coaching and college application guidance.",

Recently, the water department tested the water and found it exceeding WHO standards. This data is at source. If the building distribution system isn't cleaned then quality may suffer.\n\nMumbai has one of the most affordable and reliable power supply grid. Delhi free electricity program doesn't count.\n\nPiped gas, need I say more?\n\nServices and handymen are affordable and fairly time bound.\n\nPublic transit network is dense, affordable, and well connected. Things will hopefully become better. \n\nPeople mind their own business for the most part. Where you come from and what you believe is less relevant. What you want to become counts more. However, this may change for political and religious views, I am afraid. Once again, fingers crossed.\n\nOur slums are way better than the slums of Noida, Gurgaon, and Delhi. This isn't to aggrandize slum living. It's an observation made based on build quality, water supply, and micro economy. \n\nRenting is better than Bangalore. I had to forfeit part of the rent due to \"repairs and paint.\" Usually landlords require 10-11 months rent as deposit + 1 months rent as advance pay. Mumbai doesn't have that. As for brokers demanding commission every year, I suggest folks review the rent draft for such a clause and get it removed. If brokers call up, refuse and report them to the cops. Once the rent contract is signed and you pay broker his commission, they are out of the picture.\n\nI have lived in Gurgaon and Bangalore before returning to Mumbai for good.",

You are quite lucky if you have had a house for quite a long time, especially before the lockdown. Quite a few older buildings are outdated, but renovations do take place.

Mumbai is probably one of the best cities in India when only taking autos into account. These days there ain't too much traffic, at least not as much as there was 5-6 years ago. Quite a bit of the traffic is due to sections of the road being closed off for Metro development/construction. The metro itself is quite good. In Bangalore, bus accessibility is very high, except in certain areas in central Bangalore like JP Nagar. Quite a bit of the public relies on buses, especially after the Karnataka government passed the stupid bill giving women free tickets (T&C apply lol) [the reason this is stupid, I believe, is that this is a huge waste of taxpayers money. They will certainly realise that within a year or 2 and this is such a bill that can't even be reversed. There will be mass protests saying that there is no gender equality and what not. Over half the protestors generally don't know the whole scenario and it looks as though they start protesting after reading a news headline and not the entire article. It's not like there are no benefits of this bill tho. Women will be safer in the buses as most buses have CCTV. Well, women are quite safe in general in Bangalore, at least during the day.

        "Water is bad in some areas, Central and South Chennai are better off in this regard compared to North and West Chennai",
        "Idea? Yes, many times. In fact, every government in every country does that. \n\nIs that justifiable? No. \nThere will always be spendings made by any government across the world that is useless/waste.\n\nIs that what you are going to focus on only? God bless you then. \n\nThe fact that we as citizens don‚Äôt do our part properly and expect things to be fixed by the government(regardless of whichever party) is equal to ministers being corrupt. We are also corrupt. We need to blame ourselves also. \n\nThe difference between us and developed nations is, that they have enough budget that can even waste some of it and no one will bat an eye. Whereas we on the other side take loans from World Bank and IMF. \n\n\nMaybe lets get over the whinging and try to fix the problem.",
        "The only way to fix overpopulation in Tier 1 cities is to develop Tier 2 cities more. Madurai over Chennai for example.",
        "Yeah on this I can agree but infrastructure wise it's far far better than Mumbai. In next decade they should focus on security",
        "Well, I always try to empathize with peeps. What you said I pretty much agree, I just think maybe we should be more considerate. Yes there are definitely people who come here, use the opportunities it provides, make a living and then abuse the same. But at the end of the day, travelling everyday from Ambernath to CST is exhausting. Doing it day in day out is soul crushing. I have never done it but I can understand if people feel fed up.   \n\n\nAre they dependent on mumbai? Yes, completely. Are they wrong to complain and get angry at mumbai? Perhaps not, because they are humans. We have emotions, ambitions, situations and so much more going behind the scenes, the subconcious, that doesnt come out when one is ranting.   \n\n\nTu kaunsa shampoo karti hai waise?? üòÇ   \nThanks for the recommendation, will try to check it out but I have soo much to read and watch I feel overwhelmed!! You get that sometimes?",
        "Idk yaar call me heartless but I have no empathy for people who choose to come here for their own matlab, put pressure on our infrastructure and then call it bad. There are people who just constantly abuse Mumbai. The food, infrastructure, real estate, even the people here. So I mean if it's so bad then they're here just for the money, right? That they're rightfully stealing from locals? \nAlso have no empathy for people who travel so long and crib about their jobs. It's the same people who do nothing about it. I know people who hate their jobs but will not put any effort to even update their resume and looking for other jobs. I have worked in edutechs, so resume building is a skill I've picked up over the years. Man I spoonfed those people with an updated resume, helped with keywords on naukri but ek apply karne ka kaam nahi karte and they keep cribbing bout a shitty job and long travel. After that maine hath jode, nahi help karna kisiko. These people just love cribbing but don't wanna do anything to change their situation. I am not lucky I have an awesome job that let's me work as per my convenience. I applied for SO many jobs, rejected a few, got rejected by a few but man I worked my ass off just for the whole job hunting process because I wanted that comfort. \n\n>Tu kaunsa shampoo karti hai waise?? üòÇ\n\nHaha so I have jumped between Wow (apple cider vinegar and avocado), Matrix purple, Moroccanoil and brillaire. Matrix and Brillaire suit me the most. Moroccanoil gave me an allergic reaction but my hair was the softest. If I wasn't allergic to it, that'd be my first choice.",
        "I went to delhi for the first time this march.\n\nBut was only there for 24 hrs so i just travelled from nizamuddin to noida via metro.\n\nDelhi metro is so good n there was no rush compared to mumbai locals but it was time consuming as locals r more faster.\n\nI have heard ppl say beware in delhi as there r pickpocketers n thugs but i had a pretty good experience.",
        "I used belive this till COVID happened. I say I 'belived' caused my eyes were opened during and post covid. You see we can already WFH in fact covid showed that it was possible to WFH if need be. But human greed is why we will never have WFH. The salary you get from jobs you do in Banglore, Delhi, Mumbai, etc. doesn't only support you and your family. It also suports others like cab driver, bus, metro, tiffin service, the fuel pump attendant, landlord, your cab driver's landlord, the barista near your office, swiggy/zomato driver, the resutant, etc.\n\nSo you see huge chunk of revenue generation is removed from the economy of the city and the state if WFH is allowed. No government wants that. Because in Captialism growth is what matters no matter the cost to nature, people, etc. Offices occupying land in a city while that city not gaining enough revenue from that piece of land is the worst nightmare of any city authority. There are sooo many economic reasons for which we will never get WFH even when the technology is already there. \n\nI agree that it would crash someday. But that day is way into the future. Also Housing bubble crashing in a country's economic capital isn't good for the country as a whole. We will all feel the pain in some form if it's anything like the  2008 crash",
        "This is the way. We need more Tier 1 cities to ease out the stress on the current tier 1 cities.",
        "Your right",
        "People romanticise it because it's convenient as fuck? Like right now if I want to go meet my friend who lives 15km away I can be at this place in 1 hour ( Train+auto) and it'll cost me just Rs 100 total, and even that is because of AC train, if i go during off hours I can go in second class for Rs 10 bringing cost down to 60 or something",
        "hmm...its my lunch break, let me try to explain, its because what the other commentators said about the broken infrastructure, the insane amount of traveling (with a backup of full set of clothes no less), the prices, the lack of privacy etc. etc. so if you take a step back and view the situation as a whole... is it really an achievement....that money could have been spent improving your personal condition in many other ways if you could step out of the whole \"mumbai mayanagari\" mentality....... if your whole sense of achievement is based on the fact that you own a house in Mumbai....then i guess the only option is to laugh....",
        "Ha psych! i always say \"With the current lot of leaders we have, India has no chance of even being mediocre, forget about being best, Get Out while you can !\"  but not never anything as simple as \"India is the best\" ....we are cursed with the most inefficient political and business leadership ever seen by man",
        "Yes it is cheap but in the pursuit of remain cheap, it has made lives more cheaper that its ticket.. live with it. Nothing against the city but amount of tax mumbai pays, it doesn't reflect on its infra.. worshipping hardships doesn't solve the problem but making policy to cater ppl will do.",
        "I really don‚Äôt think so. The infrastructure is the absolute worst, people have no driving etiquette and will trample a pedestrian to get to where they want, the traffic is unmanageable and the cops lackadaisical and preying on people without fair reason. \n\nIm not partial to any city in India, I couldn‚Äôt care less about having an ‚Äúemotion‚Äù about either of these cities, as I grew up in a tier 2 city. So this is really not a Mumbai vs Bangalore debate. Bangalore is good for jobs and salaries are better than in Mumbai, but from an infra perspective Mumbai still does a better job. I‚Äôm just stating some facts here. Im happy to be challenged, but just not by someone who feels emotionally abut either city.",
        "I do live in Mumbai and experience everything in saying so, it‚Äôs 100% true for people who actually live there",
        "Your Majority of post is ranting about future projects. Go on no ones giving heed",
        "Aey kraken good to see you here as well xd",
        "Part of the reason is also because many board members, shareholders have invested in office spaces, cafeterias around the offices. If WFH becomes the norm their income would take the hit.",
        "Yes, Yogi-ji has been given the mandate to make it all safer and better. He been shooting them gangsters dead, don't you know.",
        "My city is Mumbai lol, I was just stating what I thought was right. I had visited Bangalore like 2 weeks ago so I had quite a good experience there *shrug*",
        "Jeez you seem to be an extremely motivated and driven person. \n\nAlso, opinionated üòÇ\n\nI m way too soft to hold people in a bad light I guess. I'm a little scared after reading your comment ngl. I'm sure you are fun as well.\n\nPeople like you make me think Im so lazy. Somedays I feel like, what am I even doing with my life? Definitely not using myself to the best of ability.  And then I'm like, what's even the point of life? Isnt the end goal for all we do, is to be happy? So me working 14hrs to 'realise my potential' while burning my soul, is that actually achieving someting? \n\nYou get me?",
        "I think Mumbai certainly manages chaos better.",
        "Haha opinionated, yes! Motivated and driven, idk ü§≠\n\n\n>Somedays I feel like, what am I even doing with my life? Definitely not using myself to the best of ability. And then I'm like, what's even the point of life?\n\nYaar life is not so bleak or serious. Bas strive for a good work life balance, work on your skills until you get there, never stop learning but also never stop enjoying the little things in life. \nI'm also this opinionated at my work place (between all men) and even the most toxic of those men learned to appreciate my opinions. Idc what people say, I can't be a tame woman üôà",
        "Hence, Mumbai is not for beginners... Let that sink",
        "It feels like Metro/Mono rail is being build from centuries. The unfinished infrastructure feels ancient and it creates a lot of problems. All these inconvenience better be worth in the end.",
        "Some people's work culture and synergy is apni boss ki gand chatna.",
        "If everyone protest and convince them that there's no more value in investing in office spaces as every one want's to WFH, can't that bring a little amount of change?",
        "My company has huge campuses in Bangalore, Pune, etc. but small shuttle office in Mumbai which can seat only hundreds of people. It is only for locals who already live here, I have never met anyone who lives in pg/rent just to work in Mumbai.",
        "Well, Mumbai is known for its chaos and it has been so for decades",
        "Tbh as someone who's read Simone de Beauvoir, I am happy to see women in India who take control of their lives and ideology.  \n\n\nYou know she said that in a society steeped in patriarchy but one which is very subtle and tame about it, something akin to modern day indian metropolis, a 'good' relationship is expected as a scenario in which an intellectually firm guy who is challenged by his partner, but the girl eventually yields to his wisdom. This gives the impression that the girl is given the chance to express her thoughts and opinions,  but the suitable girl is the one who will 'get convinced' eventually and internalize the patriarchal setup.\n\n\nA women going too strong is treated as a threat. Not only to the system but to scoeity itself. She is deemed too radical, too soon, too privileged perhaps, and so on goes the victim blaming. \n\n\nI think this fits so well with indian cities in general. My point being I am really happy for you. Try not to change please.",
        "Damn, you're well read and quite opinionated yourself. You should really express yourself more often. Your comment is so beautifully written that I agree wholeheartedly and have nothing more that can add value to everything you've written except, 'I absolutely agree!'. \n\n>Try not to change please.\n\nNever :))",
        "No offence, but this mentality is killing the city, forcing everyone to come here only",
        "Students have to travel in those local trains during rush hours."

    "light_cleaned_title": "Mumbai is a city in decay and an embodiment of the failure of the Indian system. I saw one guy develop Heart attack during yesterday morning rush as people crushed him during the commute. Slums, bad public infra, ultra corrupt and incompetent politicians, ugly, overpriced, outdated housing",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Mumbai and it‚Äôs supposed overflow city Navi Mumbai have failed to show any improvement in public infrastructure, quality of living, investments, IT sector development. No company in the world would want to enter Mumbai because of its lack of public infrastructure. The housing situation is pathetic. When compared to Banglore, Chennai, Gurugram, Noida, Delhi, etc the Mumbai apartments are uglier, dirtier, tinier and the societies are so ugly and outdated but definitely overpriced. People can always find a better housing facility in other cities for a much better price. Naturally the foreign investments are looking towards Ahmedabad, Chennai, Gurugram, etc The political situation is a joke in MH. There is no strong local leader. The only two local parties to have originated in Maharashtra have been destroyed and split up by Gobhi65 and hairless Mota. Only a small percentage of Mumbai residents have access to clean water supply. Most of the redditors probably belong to that category. The Mumbai Monorail is a FAILURE. The Mumbai Metro will definitely be affected by the extreme corruption in the Government and the BMC. I‚Äôm damn sure that the Airport connectivity and the rest of the metro development will get delayed and postponed by a couple of decades at least. The quality of the roads, buses and local trains is just pathetic. Half of the city gets flooded as soon as the monsoons start. The BMC ‚Äúflood prevention Blah blah‚Äù department does some shoddy work before monsoons which is just like applying lipstick on a Pig. The city is a failure in terms of planning, failure in terms of switching from mills to IT, Medical, and other modern areas of investment, failure of Public works departments, failure of the public transport system, failure of the political system Mumbai is India‚Äôs biggest city in decline. Even the politicians who rule Mumbai don‚Äôt care about Mumbai and are happy to ship off projects to other cities while ignoring that fact that lack of proper housing, transport modalities being the reason for the shift in investment trends",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "For all practical purposes, Mumbai would rank below sub saharan regions for multiple indicators. And it's a tragedy since it provides a good chunk of tax revenue to the country. Only to fund the cow belt. You mean mumbai is like every big crowded city ever? > No company in the world would want to enter Mumbai because of its lack of public infrastructure. Didn't Apple just set up shop in the priciest commercial district? I get you're frustrated, so am I, but there's a lot of exaggeration in your post. stop migrations from the cowbelt and Mumbai would instantly improve Opening retail store is not the same as setting up massive corporate offices wdym? there's tons of head offices and corporate offices in Mumbai... Those were all built back in the day when Mumbai had some developing potential. Nowadays most companies prefer Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Gurugram, Noida, etc. All those cities are much better have far lesser slums too Facts It is a city designed to cater to super rich people. But I love it nonetheless because the people are really nice. Okay man believe what you will there's no point engaging you Who hurt you bro I mean infrastructure in our country is pretty terrible its no secret. I mean I'm betting on the coastal road project to improve the road infra of the city to some extent and the pace of construction doesn't seem slow so hopefully by end of next year it'll be completed Only if WFH was an option. It would take off load from the crumbling metros. Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Gurgaon, etc. Yea so pune better than mumbai Every advanced civilization is going to fall in coming years. Is there any city in India where the officials are not corrupt? Other than overpriced housing all of the problems are present in all cities in India. International car brands also set up their dealers in various cities, doesn't mean the same for factories. r/im14 Spot on That is untrue, the city is designed to cater to people of all walks of life via its ultra-cheap public transport but fails miserably to provide affordable housing which is why slums came up in the first place, and like any Indian city, it suffers from car-based public infrastructure planning even though Mumbai can be made into the best city in the country for public transport. The more money you have, the easier it is to live here because the biggest expense here is living, and the richer you are, the better areas you have access to. In fact, most of the \"nice\" people in the city are anything but rich. While I find OP to regularly exaggerate Mumbai's demise (more like other cities finally catching up), it is true that politicians and their corruption is why we have substandard infrastructure. Unless and until all the city save Delhi, has viable public transport and not car-centric infra, they won't outdo Mumbai as the professional services hub in India Well, roads are never the solution. Investing in good public transport system is the only way to go. Seems like Mumbai did Still better than your whole GujratüòÇ Still the best city in India. What that says about our country I dunno‚Ä¶. I am one of those \"locals\" you speak of, and these anti-migrant talks often ignore that the city is built on the backs of the migrants coming in and helping out in essential infrastructure building and construction. When they asked for housing they were given zilch and thus came up slums. Indian city planning is HORRID, there's a reason why a British-designed city is still the go-to city in the country for opportunities for MANY people (not just your tech bros) Yeah his full profile is about shitting on Indian cities ü§£ Mere ‚ô•Ô∏è ki awaz bankar tum yaha aaye ho ü§ù [https://www.apnnews.com/sbicaps-inaugurates-new-corporate-office-in-bkc-mumbai/?\\_\\_cf\\_chl\\_tk=FIy8Z1fChus1DjbBwHosvn6eZK25MnEwR8\\_BQQOGLrU-1689236926-0-gaNycGzNC\\_s](https://www.apnnews.com/sbicaps-inaugurates-new-corporate-office-in-bkc-mumbai/?__cf_chl_tk=FIy8Z1fChus1DjbBwHosvn6eZK25MnEwR8_BQQOGLrU-1689236926-0-gaNycGzNC_s) [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/hindalco-leases-50000-sq-ft-office-space-in-blackstones-mumbai-tower/articleshow/97783453.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/hindalco-leases-50000-sq-ft-office-space-in-blackstones-mumbai-tower/articleshow/97783453.cms?from=mdr) &#x200B; [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/asian-paints-leases-over1-2l-sq-ft-of-office-space-in-mumbai/articleshow/95069283.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/asian-paints-leases-over1-2l-sq-ft-of-office-space-in-mumbai/articleshow/95069283.cms) &#x200B; [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/pidilite-industries-leases-entire-10-storey-office-tower-in-mumbais-andheri/articleshow/94333746.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/pidilite-industries-leases-entire-10-storey-office-tower-in-mumbais-andheri/articleshow/94333746.cms) &#x200B; [https://theprint.in/india/maharashtra-piyush-goel-inaugurates-ecgc-bhawan-new-corporate-office-in-mumbai/1421091/](https://theprint.in/india/maharashtra-piyush-goel-inaugurates-ecgc-bhawan-new-corporate-office-in-mumbai/1421091/) &#x200B; [https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/hines-plans-to-develop-90-mn-sq-ft-office-building-in-mumbai-foray-122081500693\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/hines-plans-to-develop-90-mn-sq-ft-office-building-in-mumbai-foray-122081500693_1.html) &#x200B; [https://financefeeds.com/finvasia-group-fxviews-and-zulutrades-parent-company-opens-office-in-mumbai/](https://financefeeds.com/finvasia-group-fxviews-and-zulutrades-parent-company-opens-office-in-mumbai/) &#x200B; [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/ifc-expands-india-footprint-leases-new-office-space-in-mumbais-bkc-from-brookfield/articleshow/96919761.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/ifc-expands-india-footprint-leases-new-office-space-in-mumbais-bkc-from-brookfield/articleshow/96919761.cms?from=mdr) &#x200B; [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/edelweiss-securities-leases-1-lakh-sq-ft-in-adani-realtys-office-tower-in-mumbais-bkc/articleshow/93125701.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/edelweiss-securities-leases-1-lakh-sq-ft-in-adani-realtys-office-tower-in-mumbais-bkc/articleshow/93125701.cms?from=mdr) &#x200B; [https://www.barandbench.com/news/corporate/lks-elevates-nine-lawyers-to-partnership](https://www.barandbench.com/news/corporate/lks-elevates-nine-lawyers-to-partnership) Coastal road is a pet project to satisfy politicians and their car-centric views, Mumbai will become a terrible, car-centric city in the coming years thanks to coastal roads and the waves it will create by forcing c creation of brides everywhere to resolve the bottlenecks. All the money spent on coastal road should've been used to reduce private cars on road by enforcing a human-centric planning and policy Me after missing my 4th train due to extreme rush. Best city? Lol Traffic is as bad as Bangalore, infra is in shambles, and rental prices are not for normal human beings. Full of slums everywhere and the buildings look like they're decaying. Everyone looks like they are struggling to survive. \\*Country to cater to super rich. Did the guy who got crushed survived?? You perhaps come from a well-off fam, live in some good apartment complex of a posh area. You perhaps have no idea of how dire the condition is. He survived but he‚Äôs admitted in the ICU. He actually got an heart attack. Mumbai wilk be underwater soon. Isn't it a good thing that more money is not thrown at it? That's really horrible. People suffer always and u know how busy is the government is ü§¶. Government is almost non existent. They‚Äôre busy backstabbing the voters and their own parties. Both Native parties of MH have been destroyed and split up by Mota And Gobhi65 The brokers are the real mafias The brokers have a monopoly and operate like mafia. No house is rentable without a broker and they demand we pay brokerage every year again and again as a yearly charge. It‚Äôs the most insane thing I‚Äôve ever heard of Anyone who has lived outside of Mumbai doesn't understand how people live in Mumbai. You get up at 6 am, leave home by 7am to catch super crowded 7:30 am local from Navi Mumbai to Bandra. Because at the time only Navi Mumbai was affordable which is also now expensive. Affording to live near your office is not even in the realm of options available. Then you reach the office at around 8:30am-9am and start the day after changing your shirt because it is drenched in sweat (people carrying extra shirts for commute is thing I've only heard in Bombay). You do your job until 6pm, change your shirt and again catch the crowded local to reach your home by 8-8:30 pm. You have dinner, watch some TV and fall asleep by 11pm as you need to wake up again the next day at 6am. Repeat this for the next 30 years of your life. They glorify it by calling it Mumbai spirit and all that but it is insane. Exactly. Votes would be pretty devastated üòî. Gobhi65 and mota really destroying our country and democracy. Idk how India will look like in 2030 something if bjp remain in power. It's the government. They haven't been doing shit since a while rather than changing names. I recently moved to mumbai and don‚Äôt understand the hype of this city.. this is one of the worst life anyone can imagine Both. Both are needed, and seeing Mumbai's condition...... desperately I left Mumbai in mid 20s after realising it's a shit city. Having lived all my life over there it was heart breaking but essential for me to leave for my sanity, money , physical health and interpersonal relationships. Those who say locals are a vibe have never used it for their existence. It literally sucks the joy out of you . Also the Mumbaikars who made mumbai are not the same anymore. Equal amount of gruesome rapes happen there as well. Have y'all seen the government hospital s there ? Shit. Every monsoons the wards are flooding, patients being shifted with dripping water. Same is Bangalore and Delhi. At this point it's your choice to choose the hill you want to die on. 1 hour commute sucks but it not unheard of in many other countries Where did you move to ;) ? Mumbai is a city of the rich pretending to love other economic classes also. So unless you are very rich Mumbai will inflict hardships in you , which you can never imagine in other cities. Uh‚Ä¶in the past like 10 years hundreds of multi billion companies established their head offices in mumbai, what are you going on about? But changing Bombay to Mumbai fixed everything! You're talking about Bombay problems, not Mumbai /s Most fukk ol city of india. Local train is nightmare and ppl romantises it. Couple of instances, where i found myself entangled in tue rush. These rushes are deadly. Taking lives at daily basis. The metro of mumbai taking forever time to be completed. Mumbai is a living example for what a city must not do.. *Mumbai is a city in decay and an embodiment of the failure of the Indian system. I saw one guy develop Heart attack during yesterday morning rush as people crushed him during the commute. Slums, bad public infra, ultra corrupt and incompetent politicians, ugly, overpriced, outdated housing* This is the story of every major and minor cities in India. That's why people want to flee the country. This isn't a Mumbai problem. It's a global problem. Problems created by hyper-capitalism are simply too huge and complex for top-down solutions. They require a fundamental change both in our current ways of thinking (about everything economic, cultural, political and social) and living. That change isn't going to happen until modern civilisation destroys itself and rebuilds. Times are going to be tough. If you're rich enough to shield yourself from these problems, lucky you. If not, you're in for a terrible ride. Foreign companies will literally go anywhere if there's money to be made. They'll pay their expat employees extra danger money to move to Mumbai. And Westerners love slumming it in India for a few years as an \"experience\". They're going for a car-oriented system?? OMG how awful. Even the suburban US is pivoting away from that shit One politocian claimed Mumbai will be the next Singapore by 2010. Looks like we took the opposite direction Bhai mein dilli se Mumbai gaya for work June mein . I saw people carry pair of shoes, convertible pants, shirts , etc. It was insane but people really do push themselves to their limits. > the richer you are, the better areas you have access to How is that a Mumbai situation? You are making no sense, that is the purpose of being \"rich\" anywhere in the world. Sapno ki nagri. Clean water and reliable power are provide in \"big crowded cities\" all over the world. If a city doesn't do that then it's not a city, it's just groups of slums and squatters > Stop migrations from the cow belt So, you want to end internal migration. Enforce the \"live and die where you were born\" system. Do you prefer the Chinese or Soviet methods? All legal buildings in Mumbai receive both. You cannot blame anyone for not being able to provide that to unplanned, unorganised slums. What city do you currently living? > cow belt As in agriculture? Farming? The people who grow the food you eat? The areas that provide servants for richer areas? It's incredible that people still have such contempt for the others who make their lives livable Yeah Mumbai is an urban hell. Is just that people are very nice here. That develops a feeling for the city. Are you affiliated with u/Himalayan666American who openly called Bombay a failure? Hijacking top comment to put some stuff in perspective. For one OP described every major city out there, be it NY, Tokyo, London, Moscow or Cairo. COL is a direct function of demand and supply. People who come to Mumbai without‚Äî >1. Being already well off. >2. With a family without being well off. >3. In search of a job if you aren‚Äôt a bachelor get the worst end of the stick, and that is a large majority of people. People come here to ‚Äòmake it big‚Äô but the reality is that MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO DID MAKE IT BIG never started off here, they had their roots somewhere else before expanding in bombay. IT isnt mumbais forte, it never was, isn‚Äôt meant to be. It‚Äôs finance and control‚Äîand that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs the fact that we have one of the most influential stock exchanges, ports and offshore oil drilling operations along with one of the most important airports that makes it important. The proximity to Gujarat, MP, southern states and northern states is what is important. Things being shipped off is the political pressure from the centre‚Äîand as far is politics is concerned, it‚Äôs been a joke in india for so long that I don‚Äôt remember a time when it was serious‚Äîadmittedly I‚Äôm still pretty young. There‚Äôs only so much that can be done about flooding. The drainage system clogs with high tide and that‚Äôs a huge issue with no immediate solution. Mumbai may not be perfect‚ÄîI think a lot of things are frankly absurd‚Äîbut so are all other cities. All have some or the other issue. I‚Äôd say the only city that comes close is Surat, it‚Äôs a tier 2, sure but it captures the essence of bombay better than imo any other city‚Äîand the fact that it‚Äôs a short drive away‚ÄîSurat mumbai drive takes the same time as colaba to thane in peak hours. Bas sapna hi dekhte reh jaao Same . Born and bought up in Mumbai . But left it in mid 20s to other country. I haven‚Äôt been home in 6 years. Don‚Äôt even feel like going to Mumbai anymore. I just spend the vacations locally as staycation or go to some other country. Really? If you had choice of commuting in London tube vs Mumbai local train you wouldnt choose one over the other? Apparently all Mumbai accounts for is a unsatisfactory materialistic life with huge rush Why is no house rentable without a broker ? I remember the first time I visited mumbai, an old uncle passed away in the railway station and his relatives covered the body and were mourning. We‚Äôre getting there‚Äî *when* the metro comes up, I could see myself using it often. That said I‚Äôm not representative of 99% of Mumbai‚Äôs population, I‚Äôm one of the privileged few who are able to avoid the worse parts of mumbai while still being able to enjoy the best. Mumbai sounds like Ba Sing Se. Out of context, you are correct. But the point was to combat the point that the city is designed for the ultra rich which it is not. Most of Mumbai save Powai, BKC and Cuffe parade-like areas are not designed for ultra rich and have highly accessible modes of (public) transport > Mumbai apartments are uglier, dirtier, tinier and the societies are so ugly and outdated but definitely overpriced. Ohh my sweet child ‚Ä¶. Only if you‚Äôve looked at the pathetic excuse of a city called Kolkata They have a monopoly and setup offices right in front of any new apartment and they promise the owners better rent by hiking the rent so they get more money yearly Basically owner‚Äôs greed and broker mafia is milking the middle class. People technically pay 13 months rent in Mumbai for decaying houses surrounded by slums Gobhi65 and hairless mota. Best nicknames yet Also thanks to OP for raising this issue. It's high time delulu mumbaikars realize that the administration is up to no good and Mumbai is one hell of a bad place to live in. (my father isn't letting me move to Mumbai for college) > people carrying extra shirts for commute is thing I've only heard in Bombay I used to carry an extra shirt in my bag and have another one in the college locker, just as a safeside. And my travel was the least horrendous - Ambernath to Thane. I can imagine people travelling from Airoli to Bandra wanting to carry their entire wardrobes and dressing drawers with them. I actually find Mumbai's infra to be marginally better than Bangalore. Bangalore is in the dumps. 1-hour commute is not the problem, it's how one commutes is. Not possible. Never possible. How does the OP know someone \"developed\" a heart attack and why didn't they stop to help? Who is going to stop to help? Have you ever traveled in the mumbai local during peak hours? Getting down at your stop in itself is a big task and sometimes people get pushed off at some stations involuntarily. I have faced that situation. That guy was taken in an Ambulance from Jogeshwari Station. That‚Äôs because of the Mumbai Suburban network. Auto is much better in Mumbai as they use meter. That's crazy but sooner or later the bubbles gonna burst. My friend commuted from Navi Mumbai to Vile Parle fro college daily 4.5+hr of travel.Once during heavy rains he left his home at 5:30am and reached home at 11:30pm As a teenager my only motivation to study is to leave this shithole of a country and do good for the people who are still staying here in the name of ‚Äúpatriotism‚ÄùüòÇ by reducing population by a bit But Mumbai is a feeling bro, feel it. Mumbai- \"perform or perish\" \\+1 Mumbai had its peak from the 60-90s and did fuck all with it. It all has been downhill since then. Nagpur There are 8 under construction metros in mumbai atm. Oh Jesus H dahi Puri. Please. No it isn't. Pune's infra and the speed at which infra can develop here is shameful. We still face load shedding and water shortages every Thursday, in some areas. I have never seen the condition of roads to be worse than they are now. I mean the list could go on. Point being that Pune, in no way is better than Mumbai to live in, and that's saying something. I don't wanna offend any lurking punekars though, just concerned and semi-annoyed and didn't expect deterioration in the conditions of the city I've grown up in. I really didn't. I thought Pune was impervious to change and I know I'm not the only one in thinking that. Life is race .. blah blah blah ... /s Again, how do you know it was a heart attack? Or did you say that for the shock value in the reddit thread title? The timeline doesn't even make sense, like there was an ambulance there and you waited around to see him being taken away? I can say I'm not surprised that you didn't stop considering all the stories of women being raped and people walking by and not answering the calls for help in a country where the two biggest industries are scam call centers, fake news generators, and troll farms. Not all crowded cities smell like gutter all the time. Come out of your shell The level of crowd specially in Mumbai trains is inhuman though Op seems to be new to mumbai, hi op, welcome. Coming to us, we have adapted to these things, cause we know to adjust. Punekars never talk bad about puneüò¨ What's that mean? So me having spent my whole life here doesn't make me a punekar because I have legit concerns and voiced them out on a public forum? Nah,,I am surprised and happy at the same time to see a punekar criticise a pune Wow this brings back so many memories. When I first started my job in Mumbai 10 years ago I was a motivated person with lots of dreams and ambitions. But the commute to office literally made me depressed within a year. As OP mentioned I had to carry extra clothes and shoes to office. There was such a drastic difference between my travel conditions and my office. Like how am I travelling worse than cattle to a office so posh and then supposed to be this white collar professional and pretend like my morning commute didn't almost kill me. So many times I had to hang from the door to catch the train that I was worried I should buy life insurance for my family before something happens. This literally was my motivating factor to decide to pursue higher studies in the US and I gave my everything as it was a do or die for me. Mumbai is not all bad though. The hustle culture trains you to be a very driven person. The drive could as well be to get away from Mumbai but it inspires you. No where in the world have I seen so many driven people working so so hard. This city has the best access to education, training and any other support you need for your career. Moving to Mumbai was essential for me to get access to top Class GRE coaching and college application guidance. nightmares ka slum Accha mai thoda defensive ho gaya tha 100% agree. It has become unlivable. Don't get fooled by South Mumbai. It's just an illusion. Somehow I managed to live close to my office in Bandra and Colaba. I still get panic attack thinking about getting in those local trains. I find Delhi equally disgusting not just for the rush, but also for the unruliness. Is Bangalore any better? > The drainage system clogs with high tide and that‚Äôs a huge issue with no immediate solution. If only we have a device that can automatically push fluids to a height. Just like heart push blood out to the brain. What a crazy invention that would be! >NY, Tokyo, London, Moscow pls do not compare any indian city with these cities not really there some ok 2nd tier cities which are coming up but for some reason they don't get private investment and jobs. where did the mumbaikars go ? Mumbai infrastructure is particularly terrible. Let‚Äôs be fair. Delhi is so much better. Sprite Ki Nagari Ouch. I woke up at 8 am this morning and was at work by 8:25 after a 5-minute commute. But then again I don't live in Mumbai or India for that matter lol 1 hour commute yes, but end to end in Mumbai is generally much more. Also the 1 hour commute in humane and not jam packed. If you get a car or Uber/Ola (which is a whole other task in itself), then from Navi Mumbai to BKC it is around 90-120 mins in the morning and 60-90 mins the evening back. That is insance amount daily. Really. Why do you think so? It's the same government right? Would like to visit there. a suggestion that was likely considered before they settled on tide breaks which will be the next big project after metro and coastal road. Ever been to any of those? Moscow is just as bad in peak times. Edit‚Äî how many of y‚Äôall have actually been to Moscow and travelled in peak hours? Yes. And the expats moving to India will behave like they‚Äôre suffering while getting paid 50x to 70x of the same salary given to a local employee. Most of the expats will huddle together in their expat colonies and avoid contact with the locals (except of course the super rich ones that live in these expensive expat colonies). And the cherry on the cake is when the expats move back to their country of origin they give ¬´ gyaan ¬ª on the reality of India. Yes delhi is better but still for a city with 20 Million ppl it should be better. >The housing situation is pathetic. When compared to Banglore, Chennai, Gurugram, Noida, Delhi, etc the Mumbai apartments are uglier, dirtier, tinier and the societies are so ugly and outdated but definitely overpriced Then go live there. Kisine roka hai? Par Paisa nahi milega na Mumbai jitna? Paisa kamane Mumbai bhi aana hai aur gaali bhi Deni hai. It's because of people like YOU that Mumbai is in this condition. Overpopulation is the root cause of the pathetic situation and it doesn't matter whatever/whoever else you find to blame. >No company in the world would want to enter Mumbai because of its lack of public infrastructure Lol it's the financial capital of India. All major companies are based out of mumbai. Instead of explaining I'll just leave this link: I'm saddened by the condition of a lot of people in Mumbai. But they CHOOSE to live like that for the money and opportunity that Mumbai provides. They could very well choose to live in a tier 2 city and live a more comfortable life. But you forgot the Spirit of Mumbai bro, and the city is an emotion by itself. At least that's how people justify those wretched conditions Adding this overall stats article too: what this guy said multiplied a 1000 times...i do not understand the fascination with Mumbai....its like living inside a diaper...the smell, the constant sweating, the smell....my dad used to say, if you ask a Mumbai guy what is his biggest achievement in life, he will say 'i bought a house in mumbai' Lund-fakiri ka tax leta hai bhn ke lodeü•¥ü•¥ I lived and worked in Mumbai for 3 days in the month of June once. It was enough to decide that I can never live and work in this city. &#x200B; P.S: I was staying in Andheri and working in Vikhroli and was taking Metro till Ghatkopar. 20-25k??? My friends pay 35-40k+ for ONE room in a tiny, pathetic houses that don‚Äôt even have proper facilities like having water supply and electricity 24/7*365. I wish it was 20-25k. But‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ WoRk CuLtUrE and SynErGy bangalore is a million times better IF u dont stay in IT areas which is were all of the migrant crowd stays and constantly whines. I agree that it‚Äôs most cities, but in Mumbai, the problems are compounded to a level that literally makes it unliveable. Other cities have issues that need to be addressed. Mumbai is a plain and simple hellhole that has issues on every possible level I meant in Navi Mumbai hence the commute. And yeah, water supply isn't 24*7. Electricity is decent though. \"Apkistan chala ja\" I do it everyday it sucks ass, and all because of my fucking jingoistic controlling family. Dunno much about Navi Mumbai, so I guess you‚Äôd know more. But my friends who work in Colaba/Worli/Lower Parel area have tried to live further north to save rent, but couldn‚Äôt keep up with the commute. Our work hours are very very long. Best case scenario is that you leave office at 8:30-9 PM. Worst case scenario, you leave at 1/2/3 AM. So they have to take houses nearby, otherwise it‚Äôs literally unbearable to have any sort of travel. Their deposits are in _lakhs_ and rents eat up almost all their savings. I have no idea how anyone without generational wealth is living in that city. On the other hand, I also know people who have generational wealth, and claim to ‚Äúlove‚Äù Mumbai, but have moved away to other countries lmao, the irony A semi optimistic picture you paint... definitely, there is a lot to like about life in Mumbai. I never been to Mumbai or Delhi. But here in Bangalore, most (IT)people get a two wheeler to go to office. Except during rain, it‚Äôs pretty good considering it doesn‚Äôt make you sweaty. And traffic is not that bad for two wheelers( I know people who commute 10-15kms daily on two wheelers). Also, traffic situation of Bangalore is over criticised imo, except peak hours, it‚Äôs not really that bad even for cars. Ghanta. Insecurities bhai bas Every place has its pros and cons, none are perfect after all. Nearly 7 people die in train accidents in the city. Every day. Edit. Accidents on the railways. Hahaha yeah, I was being sarcastic only. People would honestly be able to contribute so much more to work if they were allowed to rest and be comfortable. Par nahi, they just think ‚Äúif we‚Äôre paying them, we need to observe them under a microscope for the whole day‚Äù Idk, is it really that much better in other big Indian cities ? Think an argument can be made that most (all?) big Indian cities have not been designed with the people‚Äôs welfare in mind ‚Ä¶ rather the politicians purse! But no one dies on the train daily and they are possibly covering further distance Seriously. Work gets done both ways. But no, they want the FAMILY to stay together. Lol, without thinking twice about firing them. Ghanta. Real estate Mafia ne paise khilaya hai kisi ko sabke office me. And that's supposed to be a good thing? A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves. I never understood why people fantasize the idea of living like a rat. What about bangalore? But the spirit of Mumbai‚Ä¶.ü§° > Stop migrations from the cow belt and Mumbai would instantly improve It would cease to function I agree with everything except that people who make it big were already well off. Sone dreams do come true in this city. It‚Äôs survivorship bias though. How many people fail for every one that is successful. How many failed actors for one making big. How many businesses failed for one successful one. How many people became corporate slaves for a handful of executives. Some dreams come true, but the number is minuscule compared to those that failed. NYC has amazing infrastructure, please don't compare it to Indian cities. If you look at housing prices, then maybe yes. A lot of European cities have amazing public transit. Except there is no bubble. Prices are high in absolute terms not in some comparative terms. Mumbai has been expensive for a very long time. The problem is mumbai unlike landlocked cities has water on 3 sides (South Bombay area around which a lot of people work) so when expanding it essentially went outwards in one direction and also high rise building (which is never great for price or congestion). Then they started Navi Mumbai which is connected by basically one bridge to main islands. Now for quality of life people few years in their jobs move to suburbs which makes them expensive. So ultimately you are in a mess where everything is expensive. Already we are at a stage where from certain areas you can travel to Pune quicker than you can reach colaba I thought they wanted to be Shanghai. BKC is a horrid show. It looks like some American designed it. Even in a car the crossings look scary. So many offices but no access to fast public transport. Bro, Delhi is soooooo much better in this aspects, extensive metro system is like such a boon for us, like no matter what the situation we can rely on metro to get us back home, like i need to travel from north delhi to south delhi for my college and always travel by metro as both my college and house has a metro statio at a walkable distance. Saves me a lot of time As a former Mumbaikar now living in outside India, I agree wit Artorias. The best parts of Mumbai are not for the middle class or even the plain rich. They are reserved for the Ultra rich. You have to be like Ambani or Bollywood stars to live a good life in Mumbai. I can afford that kind of life outside as a simple middle class to upper middle class person. But could not afford in Mumbai even with a much favorable exchange rate. The real failing is the inability to provide half decent infrastructure. Mumbai now, all Indian metro cities are getting there The rest of it is capitalistic decay visible in all major global cities Like everything you said applies for a Singapore/ HK/ Tokyo but the quality of life is far far superior so it‚Äôs not misery. Just unpleasant. Bhai tumhari metro dashkon se bn rhi h, kab aaegi woüòÇüòÇ I live in delhi and it's not this bad, like we literally bought a 4bhk appartment for 95Lacs 1.5 years ago and it's beautiful üòÇüòÇand metro is just the solution for all the commute. Only problem i can see is high crime. People used to call Mumbai city of dream's. And also a city that never sleeps. Some of my observations for the major cities: Tokyo is madness during rush hour. They have reached their limits in public transportation, but the population density does not ease up for anything. London has fairly got it under control. It has an excellent public transport on rails. And the lines cover a LOT of areas in the cities and beyond. Paris- trash during rush hour. Trains are not frequent. Very little coverage in the city. Rail Infra is dismal. Road infra much better for Paris cos of disciplined traffic. Rome was crazy on roads too. Rome- Trash during rush hour. Rail situation same as Paris. Rome is crazy on roads too. Traffic rules are a joke. Rash driving and everything moves slow. Amsterdam- just fine during rush hour. They have a lot of frequent outstation trains with bigger capacity. Not that much coverage for intracity rails like NY or London, but does the job. NYC- embodiment of Mumbai. Crazy expensive houses. Financial capital. Subway is the lifeline. Shite politicians whitewash everything with the spirit of the city. The biggest difference is taxi fare. Singapore- excellent public transport and infra. Typical rush hour traffic. As good as London. Kuala Lumpur- using the road is a nightmare during rush hours or rain. Metro doesn't give you any great respite. Cairo and Moscow- Not been there yet. True man but that will hugely affect the small food vendors.. rikshawala.. dabba wala and such ppl bcz most of there income comes from the people using there service. I actually do like the policy - as a woman I would rather NOT be surrounded by cow belt men! Fair enough, it‚Äôs still expensive and crowded. the local train is the worst no matter which one you take I hate it from bottom of my heart The city generates so much revenue still suffering they should think of adding extra trains extra tracks maybe connecting two different part of different city to reduce the pressure but it is working as it is from many years I'm born and brought up in Delhi and moved to Bangalore for my IT job. I find the traffic situation here to be much worse than what I was used to. You need to live atleast 5km from your office to keep your sanity. Is Kolkata overpriced as well? This is a very, very strange comment, and it reeks of your privilege. The \"cow belt men\" are one of the major driving forces behind the city. Except for people, and maybe night life. And if you're a female a lot more than that. People are comparatively more progressive (in terms of inclusivity, mentality, freedom, woman and even religions) when compared to other metro cities and especially compare to north. as someone who visited Mumbai recently, Bangalore is far better but anyways all are shit. just Bangalore stinks less Been to all the cities you mentioned except NY, have heard a lot though. Fortunately have been to Cairo and Moscow and for Cairo it‚Äôs just too crowded with a lot of scams and shit. Moscow is so so so crowded. It‚Äôs crazy. Even on Sundays. Mumbai will always be an important city inspiye of its problems. The politicians know that. Mumbai has big sea ports which mean a lot of goods have to come and go through Mumbai. Unlike Vaizag which is to the extreme South, Mumbai is centrally located in India. The stock exchanges are also in Mumbai. Finally, no other city has such good people. The people in Mumbai are mostly law abiding, respectful. Most people are professionals or in jobs. Unlike Delhi, where everyone is connected to some politician. Everything else being shitty, people who migrate to Mumbai still like it because of the people. You can be who you are and no one will care. Be gay, straight, stay out late at night etc etc. women feel more secure than most other cities. The goons also stay to themselves and won‚Äôt harass you unless you get in their way. The police may be corrupt but they are also mostly humble. You have to see the police in Delhi/Haryana. Mumbai cops are angels when compared to them. singapore has subsidized housing üíÄ it costs less than 10% of your monthly salary I have dropped the idea of seeing pyramids because of the massive number of touts in and around the place. So many negative reviews, I think it'll mess up my chi if I ever visit üòÅ Yeah not us but the pilitician oh boy kolkata is such a mess lol all the houses look like they will collapse easily and public transport is trash...buses and local trains are crowded most of the time and metro lines seem as if they will open after 100 years It‚Äôs worth going through, I was like 3 when we visited but it was an amazing trip. Go in a customised tour with a full time driver and a guide, they are much better that way. i pulled my best friend out of mumbai cos i stepped in mumbai in 2004 n decided this is the worst city in India as i had lived across east west north south of india as an army kid. initially my friend who was living there for a decade couldnt get himself out of mumbai but once he moved he's decided never to go back there. It's an initial step everyone has to make...you might feel left out but within a few months you would appreciate your life better. start applying for jobs out of the city its not that hard Mumbai is definitely better than Bangalore. How do I know? I've experienced both, lived in both, for years. And before any of you tries to baselessly discriminate, I'm also an outsider to both. If I can say some good things about a city, I can also highlight a few that need improvement. Don't get emotional, don't lose your shit. Wait until you hear about night shifts and how employers do not care about employee suffering. Singapore is a far far far far better place to stay. The government provides subsidised housing and the quality of life is amazing. Singapore metro is spot on and clean. Public toilets everywhere, water dispensers everywhere, fantastic and clean public infra I live in a decent society 1000 sq foot 2BHK almost on the outskirts. 60K Rent. Downstairs there no space for even walking. Even if you try, tiles have rotten water stuck in them that get‚Äôs pushed out on to your legs as you walk. Outside the gate there are 2 big slums which you have to cross to come to the main road. Those slums are like mazes of hell. People literally live right next to a Garbage dumpster that smells like rotten curry. The lanes in the slums can‚Äôt fit 2 people at a time but they are endless. Shirtless, abusive boys roam around and look busy. Sometimes they come outside to smoke up and check out the girls inside the society. Politicians make money from the slums through local gundas, hafta, rents, illicit business, that‚Äôs why they exist. Slums are the economy that make politicians black money. Mumbai is messed up, friends. Fab!! Will definitely try this option. Yeah for the filthy dilapidated flats that demand whatever price they have in mind Worth it, don‚Äôt miss the Nile cruise‚Äîif you have more days then try clubbing Jordan and optionally Lebanon in the trip. If you have shenzen visa then u can also do Egypt and Greece. You can do a cruise or it‚Äôs a 2 hour flight. Cow belt men carry their regressive culture along with them and commit crimes against women. No thanks. Eh your downright racist ranting here should have you booted out of Mumbai as well but then again that's a city that elected shiv sena for similar tirades. It's tax revenue is a function of being a financial capital and having second largest port in the country, Mumbai would still be shit hole irrespective of migrants you consistently choose to elect some of the most corrupt politicians to run the BMC. Why are you acting as if all major metropolitan cities aren't this strained all the time? Paris is absolutely filthy with garbage on the streets and random drug addicted people just shuffling around literally every single place. New York also has god awful housing prices and living with a car is pretty much impossible due to astronomical parking prices. Major hubs of all countries look like this because everyone wants to live there. >Nowadays most companies prefer Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Gurugram, Noida, etc. Yes and no, rise of the rest of these cities is a function of both economic rise of these areas as much as lack of space in Mumbai. Mumbai's was in a way India's first and only white collar city for the longest time, it wasn't going to the only one after 1991 reforms obviously. There are 8 under construction metro line in Mumbai at the moment, I don't get why people assume that just because one is happening the other can't happen. Mumbai was the only functional suburban network for the longest time and that's what made them lazy. I was going to give you the benefit of doubt over your previous comment, because maybe I'd interpreted it wrong. But‚Äîyou're just straight up xenophobic. Hyderabad and Chennai are currently the best Metros in India, Pune is catching up. Delhi, Mumbai is going down, followed by Bangalore. Kolkata is livable (transport, rent) - but lacks in jobs, industry. Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Kochi are nice to live - but not Metros, lacks high paying jobs and entertainment areas. Gurgaon - I haven't been there, can't say. Bro got some unsolved issues with kolkataüíÄ Wow! You have been to places , man!! You need not mention your age, your comment was too cringe to have guessed anyways. There are genuine hard working people out there working to make this country function, it could be a government school teacher working extra hard or a social worker going above and beyond to help out under-served poor people. Your are free to leave, you are seem privileged enough to have the resources but please don't mock others who don't choose to do the same. Can't boot a local, sweetie. But yeah, cry \"racist\" at everything, that'll get you far in life. Just curious, How is the surge pricing scene for ola /uber in Mumbai? Delhi it costs around 200rs for 15kms local , non peak hours oMg YoU doNt lIke LeWd vUlgAr MeN aNd ThE RiSk oF rApE??? you don't enjoy gangrape????? YOURE LITERALLY HITLER!!!!!!!!!!11111 Wait what?!, yearly brokerage wtf üò∂ Fun Fact : The Total fertility rate of mumbai is 1.4. Don't get surprised if it falls to 1.0 by 2040. Kolkatta is even worse, it's at 1.2. No third world country reports such low fertility rates, proving how bad are situations in our metro cities! One of our relative who lives in Mumbai says if a middle class have more than two kids, lifelong slum tour is guarenteed lol. >The political situation is a joke in MH. There is no strong local leader. The only two local parties to have originated in Maharashtra have been destroyed and split up by Gobhi65 and hairless Mota. While blaming outsiders is a given and tempting and would prove to be a smash hit in this sub but even when you did have strong regional leaders in form of Bal thackery or Sharad pawar, these guys mostly sucked Mumbai dry for decades, when other cities raced ahead. Mumbai metro shed was stuck because of one guy's ego, i.e Uddhav thackery. All real local leaders that Maharashtra politics has produced have sucked ass for the most part. Absolutely not, I've lived in pretty much all metros. Bangalore traffic is by far the worst. The living places near the tech parks are also pretty shit with water clogging everywhere during rains and just people everywhere. Hyderabad probably has the best traffic amongst these and even here traffic has gotten a lot worse over the last year or so. Atleast the gangs don't control the entire city like they did 20 years ago,they are still there but less powerful Go far back enough and everyone is an outsider sweetie especially in Mumbai and no apologies for calling a spade a spade, word of advice don't do a similar tirade, irl. Aajao pila dunga I have been here for little over a year and I cannot, for the life of me, understand what makes Mumbai the city of dreams. So, I gave up. I am out, Mumbai. Bhai WFH vala apne Ghar ke pas se khaenga to vha ke thele valo ko support milega The difference is Bengaluru is an up and coming city having growth challenges and Mumbai is a decaying city breaking down. Of course both are similar now, but only one has a good future ahead. I'm not even from Bengaluru or living there right now but the difference is visible when visiting both cities. Hey man you are not displaying \"Spirit of Mumbai\"! Sadly I agree with all of this main problem is overflow of people in Mumbai. Please stop coming here, we really don't have any space left. Sadly we all have habitat to live this life of rush and toxicity bcoz other parts of country is no doing much. If all the states start developing their region this might change For the people shitting and hating Mumbai over all th India you all have been benefitted from this city either by our taxes or business involved. Mumbai has taken the burden of driving many things for this country. So stop putting your privileged opinion here and work and make your states much better. Unfortunately people in India are not honest enough for wfh. They need constant supervision and monitoring to produce. We tried it and it saved us a lot of money on rent but we had to move back to office. Yea, they will keep harassing you and since there‚Äôs nothing legal they can do, they will hike the rent and bring in new tenants for the newly hiked rent and the owners will give you notice to vacate Bangalore weather is atleast better so you don't smell like a dogs ass. Delhi pays less tax than Mumbai yet they built it earlier. How? atmost* My opinion might sound crass but Mumbai is the best place to live if you are rich. Best restaurants, hotels, shopping and education. Easiest to get super professional house help, cooks and drivers. If you are rich then Mumbai is the city for you. All of these problems stated by OP existed in the 90s in Bombay when I lived there. Love the reaction you're trying to incite. I've lived in Mumbai and have encountered both sets of people: good and bad, from both Mumbai itself and your so-called \"cow belt\". I'm not saying bad people or bad men don't exist. Your comments, however, are completely anti-migrant and I don't think you realise how much the city relies on them to function. I'd love to see you try to imagine a day in your life in Mumbai, without any migrants, because you're so adamant on \"stop migration from cow belts!!!\" Crime happens, and it is a horrible thing. I'm not downplaying that. If it seems like it, I apologise, because that was not my intention. But your comments come across very poorly. Surely it‚Äôll boost up eventually I have worked 3-4 years in night shifts and/or evening shifts (4:30pm to 2am) in Noida. I personally dont mind but yeah. Abhi ye hi generalization Muslim ke upar kar denge to g phat jayegi aap ki Angoor nahi mile toh khatte hai boss. I see it this way- at some point you‚Äôll do SOME work, because otherwise what the fuck else will you do. Not like offices are prime-productivity hubs. Everyone gossips, loiters about, takes long lunches, scrolls on social media‚Ä¶ One group forms, everyone gets distracted/joins them. If there‚Äôs a genuine exercise that needs everyone to be present, have WFO. Otherwise WFH saves everyone a shit ton of time and energy. If I‚Äôm made responsible for X piece of work to finish until 8 PM, I will do it. If I fail to meet deadlines, and it is habitual, fire me. If I want to keep my job, I will work. It‚Äôs as simple as that. There‚Äôs nothing office/home related about this. If you hire decent people and pay them a decent amount, nobody will say no. If companies like TCS that literally run modern slavery in their campuses complain about ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù, I have no sympathy for them deploying low-quality work and their rep tanking. It‚Äôs not a one-way street. Treat your employees with care and dignity. Pay them a liveable wage. They‚Äôll get the job done. Most people I know don‚Äôt care about work because there‚Äôs NOTHING for them to look forward to. Commute. Pollution. 3/4 salary in rent for a shitty home. Who the fuck will feel motivated about that. You will cut corners when hard work doesn‚Äôt get even acknowledged, let alone rewarded. Anything in main kolkata has been already purchased since the dawn of time, and anything outside... Well let's just say the ratio of quality to price will make mumbai look good in this post. One could say all these about India as well. I kinda agree. This post lingers on hyperbole and exaggeration. But I do think telling people to shut up or leave is not a good way at looking the way things stands. While mumbai still gets migration has a mass level, its nothing compared to what it used to get. Alot of people here are 2nd generation, for whom mumbai is home. And for them, leaving home for better prospects elsewhere is not a matter of just packing your bags and leaving. In a sense, alot of people are stuck here. I hope you get my sentiment.üôè Also, god your hair is lovely. And hair is everything, from Fleabag. If you know you know. As much I hate Delhi this is the only part I like about Delhi shrimati sheela i guess Why do people live like this? I am what some may call privileged (I wasn't) but I regret every waking moment emotionally deciding to move back here And local trains are right down there with mumbai. Who said it? Delhi is the highest tax payer check your facts Shift to gurugram,Noida they will be next big cities in india and they are very well planned Have you visited Noida and Gurgaon? Migrants from anywhere but the cow belt are all fine. They integrate nicely and aren't of a criminal bent. My South Indian neighbour's daughter practices classical music. They never make any noise, are well-behaved people. Meanwhile the Northern upstairs neighbours play trashy, vulgar bhojpuri stuff and are generally raucous, do not raise their children well, and there's like 9 or more of them in a 2 bed apartment...yikes. So reading all the comments here I want to ask why people continue to have children? Why would you want them to live like this? Serious question That‚Äôs what I meant it‚Äôs bad during peak hours. When it rains, that‚Äôs another story. Used to be , in the last 4 years, even the subsidised housing rent has gone up by 80%. It's super expensive. 1st or 2nd most expensive city/country in world. Sounds similar to life in Toronto nowadays. Oh yeah, it‚Äôs definitely bad during peak hours. But central Bangalore is not that bad, that‚Äôs where I live and work. Not a single city in the entire country is ever going to become like Singapore, especially after considering we‚Äôre on borrowed time cause of climate change. Maybe they can be as authoritarian as Singapore, but not the good things. The slow fall of a country It gets worse with every single comment of yours. I genuinely can't deal with you anymore, have a nice day. Good riddance. Its called cow belt because politics not people. Pune is 5 years behind Bangalore in terms of everything. The old areas still seem working fine but the new areas with IT money are proper shit. 5Cr apartments with tanker water is just sad. Hey, you forgot to cry \"racist, bigoted, privileged, blahblah\" at the end of your comment! Any place is good if you‚Äôre rich. What matters is how good it is when you‚Äôre poor Yeah central Bangalore isn't actually that bad. The roads are wide and it's well connected. Sadly most offices are far from the center though. Didn't even use some of those words, but I'm loving the self awareness sisü§ç Yeah, Mumbai is the most cosmopolitan city in India. It doesn't have the same insular attitude as other Tier 1 cities. It's a damn shame they can't fix their shitty housing situation because it has every reason to be India's number 1 city like NYC is for the US. Right now that's probably BL for India. > 'i bought a house in mumbai' honestly that's pretty impressive and something most couldn't do. not sure why we're supposed to laugh at that. Na na na na na Mumbai meri *jaaaan* /s Hello from Namma uru, Bengaluru. Today, I had the pleasure to drive through my beautiful city. For the better part of my life I have lived here. Our geniuses at BBMP (city administration) decided to dug up newly paved roads in the middle of monsoon yesterday or day before adding to traffic woes. What should have been a 20-25 min drive took me about 1.25 hr in the morning( I took my bike instead of car to save time) In the evening, there is sewage water on the roads, water falling like rain from overbridges, one guy in a Benz stopped randomly in the middle of the road to load stuff blocking traffic. I feel sad, people don't respect each other. Most people feel entitled, delivery guys risking their lives on the road to deliver a food order in the rain. To top it off Son of Benguluru (aka Supreme leader) visited pre election, blocking traffic and promising that the final link of purple line of metro will be live by July. July is here and well surprise, surprise. When will this end? Metro is coming, but not in the next 2 years. With luck in the next 3 years, for sure in the 5 years. Well... Yeah because Singapore GDP per capita is 7 times that of Mumbai? And Mumbai has 5 times the population of Singapore. Also all your post are filled with Mumbai hateüóø Is it sweaty and jam packed too? I know the ride from suburbs is long but is it 4 hours daily? I've heard its more like 90-120 min daily. But again that would depend on where you live. Fr. I have been seeing alot of Mumbai hate posts lately especially in r/UrbanHell. Also check OP's posts. Dude obsessed with Mumbai lmao. Thanks for including sources to back up your thoughts. Gobhi65 and Hairless mota are by far the best monikers. üòÇ Born and raised in Mumbai and I hear you. I want to add a few more points. This is not a defence; it's balancing your points. The water in Mumbai is the best in the country. Recently, the water department tested the water and found it exceeding WHO standards. This data is at source. If the building distribution system isn't cleaned then quality may suffer. Mumbai has one of the most affordable and reliable power supply grid. Delhi free electricity program doesn't count. Piped gas, need I say more? Services and handymen are affordable and fairly time bound. Public transit network is dense, affordable, and well connected. Things will hopefully become better. People mind their own business for the most part. Where you come from and what you believe is less relevant. What you want to become counts more. However, this may change for political and religious views, I am afraid. Once again, fingers crossed. Our slums are way better than the slums of Noida, Gurgaon, and Delhi. This isn't to aggrandize slum living. It's an observation made based on build quality, water supply, and micro economy. Renting is better than Bangalore. I had to forfeit part of the rent due to \"repairs and paint.\" Usually landlords require 10-11 months rent as deposit + 1 months rent as advance pay. Mumbai doesn't have that. As for brokers demanding commission every year, I suggest folks review the rent draft for such a clause and get it removed. If brokers call up, refuse and report them to the cops. Once the rent contract is signed and you pay broker his commission, they are out of the picture. I have lived in Gurgaon and Bangalore before returning to Mumbai for good. what are you doing to get out of this shithole as soon as possible? Mumbai was honestly the most garbage city I have ever lived in and I have lived in nearly every Indian metro City. I often used to joke that this city needs to be flattened and reworked fully. I'm just thankful that the hot climate and language barrier is keeping the Indian middle class horde out of Chennai. Rents are reasonable, houses are spacious and available near to your workplace, good public transport and the traffic is manageable. I was talking more about housing. Well not sweaty, cz the weather helps. But rides are long if you are taking public transport. 1 to 1.5 hour each way average. So 2-3 hours to and fro. It is packed in peak hours. But yeah people are respectful and don't touch you and try to keep respectful distance. Is it anything like the Mumbai level in Hitman 2? Desi Gotham City. Wait till someone murders a billionaire couple in an alleyway in front of their son. Ok. People are free to move to any of the other cities. Always felt like a cityscale shanty > True man but that will hugely affect the small food vendors.. rikshawala.. dabba wala and such ppl bcz most of there income comes from the people using there service. Society changes all the time and people adapt. Especially service industry people. If people work from home a lot more, then the Dabba and rickshaw wala would change their job to something else that provides relevant service for the work from home crowd. You have spoken my exact words bro Toh bhi g**nd marwane ke liye bahar se public idhar aati hai .kya bole bhai I was in Mumbai last week for work and it truly is shocking. It's pretty much a tiny uber rich class (in Juhu, South Bombay etc) surrounded by slums after slums. There was a bridge heading out of Kurla that even had high fencing to stop you from seeing the slums below (Ahmedabad model I guess). > The hustle culture trains you to be a very driven person. The drive could as well be to get away from Mumbai but it inspires you. No where in the world have I seen so many driven people working so so hard. This city has the best access to education, training and any other support you need for your career. Moving to Mumbai was essential for me to get access to top Class GRE coaching and college application guidance. Sorry this just sounds like toxic positivity cope. What you call driven can easily just be described as desperation. Grats to you for making it to the US, but let's not sugarcoat matters here. In one day i saw as many people as i saw in my whole life. That's when i decided i should nope the fuck Outta Mumbai. Man I don't want to sound like Hitler but i want to nuke Mumbai if given the chance ü•≤ Missing 4 trains? Get your shit together, rookie. /s He wasn't mocking hard-working people. He was mocking false patriotism. Bakchod karne ke liye kuchbhi bolne ka aadat hogaya hai public ko Could have written the exact same words in 1880 and it wouldn't have made any difference. Same system, different era. My Cousin Migrate in Luxemburg Last year Earlier his home was at Marine drive Think Ahead. It's insane how many places in the world have this dynamic. I live in the SF Bay Area and a lot of what you said applies here too. Of course we have many advantages here too. But the fucking grind that the majority of humans have to live through to try and survive capitalism is insane. Also explains why Dharavi has been allowed to stay on for so long. What do you do in the US now? Not every company is google or a highly funded startup to pay big wages and hire top talent. Most companies have to actually worry about economics to keep the lights on and have to make do with sub standard employees that have to be managed. I think people should be grateful for any job they get in a country like India. Once people are unemployed for long periods of time they will appreciate someone giving them a job. Unfortunately it is necessary to drive employees to turn a profit in India as the customer is very stingy and has no brand loyalty. I know it's exaggerating yaar par my comment was mostly towards the people who come from outside and bash Mumbai. Itni dikkat thi to kyu aaye? Rehte apne small town me. 2nd/3rd generations, basically people born and brought up here almost never abuse Mumbai. Mumbai has its problems but still provides livelihoods to lakhs and lakhs of people. Wo kehte haina jis thali me Khao usi me chhed nahi karte. Ye aise logo k liye tha. The ones that crowd our city, looking for opportunities that change their whole ass life and still have the audacity to abuse. Btw criticism is different. And his post was borderline delusional. Counterclaims ka proof bhi diya. Par anyway, can't do much about such people. Jahaan opportunity hai wahaan aise log ayenge hi. >Also, god your hair is lovely. >And hair is everything, from Fleabag. If you know you know. Thank you! Hair compliments make my day :) And Fleabag is üòç I just love Phoebe Waller Bridge. If you like her acting, Crashing is another good series! those people are highly adaptable. They will figure out where their clientele is based and move there Idk what you talking about, I moved to Mumbai recently and it‚Äôs gorgeous, people are always understanding and kind, rickshaws work on meters, safe for my women friends, people language is indifferent. There are always bad apples but not that bad you ranted about. I agree. Mumbai is certainly a dystopian hellscape that unfortunately is a reality for non natives. New York prices with the hygiene levels of Somalia. Just not able to juxtapose these aspects. This is not to say other Indian cities are cleaner. But at least they don‚Äôt charge a bomb Yeah, a lot of big cities kind of that problem. Bay Area, New York, London, Tokyo all are pretty expensive to live near city center. But the thing is you can travel decently within 60 mins (maybe except bay area from what I have heard, its an exception). And from that range, you can get a pretty decent apartment at reasonable rate. I am a software engineer and 100% work from home. India has enough population to carry the forward the bubble for decades. In fact I wouldn't even call it a bubble. People always keep coming to that city for work there will always be demand. Oh! Thanks. Totally different definition from what we use Sure but as a woman, I wouldn‚Äôt live anywhere else While I agree with the issues pointed out, Mumbai has had clean water supply and reliable power for years. OP‚Äôs articles on water don‚Äôt match up to his comment that only a certain percent get clean water I worked in Mumbai years ago. I tell people I \"did time\" in Mumbai for 2 years. There are solutions for flooding, check out the storm water drainage system employed in Tokyo. Basically a huge underground storage tank for storm water and then release it slowly into the sea. Hey can you say about what you did in the US? r/technicallythetruth I think what OP means to say is that, the problems obviously exist. Just that everything is turned up to eleven. And that is the core problem. Sure problems exists for all cities. Just that how is everything so terrible. At the same time... One place where Mumbai shines far better than Bangalore is water quality and electricity. It might not be good, but its faaaaaar better than what Bangalore has to offer atleast. Just my hypothesis , but this might change in few decades as most people with corporate jobs might sift over completely to be able to do remote work , which I know corporate working class doesn't make up majority of the people, but will also shift in upcoming decades. And, maybe mumhai bubble is bigger and more resilient then any other but it would eventually burst beacuse, it eventually reach a point, where it could only go down hil and inflated markets always crash eventually. Yeah I saw it on discovery a few years ago‚Äîbut do you really think that something like that would realistically be built in india, not to mention unlike Tokyo, we hit water while digging much much faster(also why it was so easy to reclaim most of mumbai) People want to flee but won‚Äôt pay taxes. They will whinge a lot hut won‚Äôt pay taxes. This country is running in minimal tax and that‚Äôs been happening for decades. All of these issues need tax money to address them. Not discrediting how fucked up our politics is, but we aren‚Äôt the best bunch either. Go to developed countries and you end up paying 45% income in taxes sometimes. You just captured my though process about living in Mumbai. Well said bro! Mumbai Metro has been \"coming up\" for atleast the last 14 years. Yes, Mumbai is indeed in decay, but it's not all bad. There are indeed quite a few good things about Mumbai. I agree about the buses part but I haven't used local trains much so can't say much about that. It's been quite a while since I used the Metro. Some areas in general are better off than others tho (not talking about SoBo) like Powai and Ghatkopar. It wasn't always as good as it is, but it has certainly gotten better. The roads are decent enough. Do note that Powai is isolated from public transport with the exception of a few buses here and there. The housing part is kinda true, but not all that bad. It is quite difficult to get a new house these days due to the high expenses. The houses are small only if the buildings are new, but it also depends on the developers. You are quite lucky if you have had a house for quite a long time, especially before the lockdown. Quite a few older buildings are outdated, but renovations do take place. The area that I am in, the buildings were repainted. The houses are definitely not ugly, dirty or tiny, but I am only speaking for myself and my area. Can‚Äôt pay people the minimum liveable wage? Maybe don‚Äôt start a company. Nobody is forcing you. It‚Äôs extremely unethical and exploitative. Also ‚Äúcustomer is very stingy and has no loyalty‚Äù. Seriously??? You guys are all for ‚Äúfree market‚Äù and ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù when y‚Äôall make money, but when others have products and services better than yours, and the customers switch (as they should) you crib about the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù. Nobody owes you loyalty. If you offer good products and services, people will stick to you. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Indian companies very happily cite ‚Äúexcess of labour‚Äù to underpay employees because ‚Äúthere are others who will do what you do at a lesser salary‚Äù. Guess what? There‚Äôs an excess of companies too, and we as customers can do whatever we want. I‚Äôm tired of ‚Äúentrepreneurs‚Äù nowadays wanting to have their cake and eat it too. To them, everything is someone else‚Äôs fault. Customer, employees, government, competitors, etc etc. I think concentrating industries and job opportunities into a single place does that Haha Bangalore has improved much over the years wrt public transport but it's surely in the dumps if you are only talking about autos. Mumbai is probably one of the best cities in India when only taking autos into account. These days there ain't too much traffic, at least not as much as there was 5-6 years ago. Quite a bit of the traffic is due to sections of the road being closed off for Metro development/construction. The metro itself is quite good. In Bangalore, bus accessibility is very high, except in certain areas in central Bangalore like JP Nagar. Quite a bit of the public relies on buses, especially after the Karnataka government passed the stupid bill giving women free tickets (T&C apply lol) [the reason this is stupid, I believe, is that this is a huge waste of taxpayers money. They will certainly realise that within a year or 2 and this is such a bill that can't even be reversed. There will be mass protests saying that there is no gender equality and what not. Over half the protestors generally don't know the whole scenario and it looks as though they start protesting after reading a news headline and not the entire article. It's not like there are no benefits of this bill tho. Women will be safer in the buses as most buses have CCTV. Well, women are quite safe in general in Bangalore, at least during the day. IDK about the night tho, as I haven't travelled much in the night.] Heard of Austin, Houston, Shanghai, Schenzen? Moved to Mumbai in 2012 and I never got the hype. Everytime I hear the words \"Spirit of Mumbai\" it angers me since it is this very spirit that makes our politicians lazy. The current regime itself came into picture after they had an all expense paid trip to Guwahati and Goa. Metro work has ruined the good roads that were in the city and one of the active metro lines are next to my office, but I see zero improvements in traffic. You'll only traffic cops at places where they can extort money due to bad roads and lane placements. I won't get started on the weather now. Achievement unlocked üòÇ But you were supposed to say how nice the people are(honestly, until you start to speak hindi with a up/bihar accent), nobody is allowed to to discuss these things. And it might never get addressed until people stop calling this mayhem 'The Spirit of Mumbai.' Labeling people's misfortune as spirit is some brilliant marketing done by God knows who. I lived there for 2 months and I will never again. People are cool and it has a certain character but it's not worth living in. Few years ago nobody thought bullet trains could be built in India, I feel it's just a matter of political will. Once the decision is taken it becomes an engineering problem. Tbf they have been under construction for like a decade at this point and we haven‚Äôt reached anywhere at all with it. Either way it would just be much simpler to build water breaks like in Venice‚Äîit would tackle 2 problems at once‚Äîtides and flooding and rising sea levels. Transfer a 600 million population to London and we will find out. Your last line should be first. As a tenant it sucks to pay brokerage and inflated rent for a tiny house. I understand your concern. But then nobody is stopping you from moving elsewhere. The city has its own problems , but atleast this city accommodates people and has strong roots unlike the ones you mentioned above. Guru gram, Hyderabad ,Bangalore are just cheap-dubai. They have no roots and all they have is floating population and a wannabe crowd of young workforce . You can't think of living for generations in those cities as the culture is not that way . If people like me don't start companies where will you work? Not everyone can work for the govt.. Like I said once you are not able to find a job for a year you will be on your knees praying that someone like starts a business so you can get a paycheck. No one owes you a liveable wage. Lets see you start a business and generate employment for people. \"You can‚Äôt offer them what they like? They‚Äôll take their money elsewhere.\" Same way if you are not productive enough, I won't simply pay you a liveable wage out of the kindness of my heart. If you are not okay with it, I can always replace you with someone else who better suits my needs. Not in Mumbai But I think people (those who can't afford to spend time nor have money) justify it either by marking them as pension funds or \"it's their problem\" kind of attitude. Maybe. I genuinely feel like Chennai is the best out of all metros. Other than the shitty weather, it's safe, not too much traffic and the crowd isn't too bad Yes, I agree with you about safety and traffic. What about water? I got to know the situation is bad. How many levels of tone deaf are you? You think you‚Äôre doing the world a favour by running a company that provides subpar products and services (by your own admission) that even the clients don‚Äôt want to continue to be around?? Buddy, the world will do just fine without you. Nobody is on their knees begging you for a place in whichever obscure company you‚Äôre running lmao. There are plenty of ways to make money without working for a topic entitled jerk who pays you less than minimum wage. Independent practitioners (lawyers, doctors, industry consultants), academicians, healthcare professionals, farmers, etc. The delusion some of you people have is ridiculous üòÇ no wonder bankruptcy rates are through the roof, and no wonder your clients leave and your employees give you subpar work until they can switch to something better. And if you think offering people minimum wage is optional because you can just hire someone else, you have the answer to why your staff gives you subpar work and why your attrition rate is high. Continue running it the way you want to, I guess, but that way you are always going to be ‚Äústruggling to keep the lights on‚Äù. It is an Indian's (who has never stepped foot inside a local train or commuted to work without a car or has been to southern USA) idea of how a city should be planned, almost any Indian-made city is devoid of public transport or human-focused planning. yeah what's the point you're trying to make here? It fucks up the people's life there as well? What the fuck, is brokerage really demanded every year? I've been searching for a flat in Mumbai and fortunately found one without a broker, but no broker has ever mentioned charging brokerage every year. That's just nuts, both logically and financially. What if the tenant and landlord renew the lease agreement on their own without involving the initial broker? Will they threaten the landlord/tenant? I don't really understand. The broker will keep harassing the tenants. They will bring in new tenants who are ready to pay more rent than the current one. The owners also don‚Äôt try to fight the brokers as they‚Äôre getting more rent and a steady supply of tenants. That makes absolutely no sense. Where does 600 million even come from? Mumbai's population is some \\~22 million people. Damn, didn't know it was like that, makes sense that the owner is involved though. I've seen many flats which have already decided that they'd increase the rent by 5-10% after the lease expiry. Would be better to have this arrangement in case someone plans to stay in the same flat for multiple years since the broker won't have the owners backing in this case. Even if you make agreement for multiple years they demand you pay coverage for the entire duration of the agreement That just sucks and is so wrong. I guess it's better to find good owners without brokers for peace of mind. Ugh, hate those people who are like \"India is the best\", and then voluntary move to live in another country. Then lecture people living in India from there about how everything is good and people are just complaining because whatever stupid whatsapp forward they say in their uncle group. These kind of people are generally the first ones who give up their citizenship when given the chance. Which is one of the worst things you can do as a citizen of a country. Okay, for your convenience, let's transfer 22 million people in London and then see the difference. I have stayed in mumbai and this is just 5% true. What you say is true. The only good thing about Mumbai is people I guess. True, instead of crushing ourselves in the locals and metro, WFH is a good option especially in the times of monsoon when it gets even more jam packed and also late. Solves the problems for the people living far away from their homes and have to travel 2 hours to reach their workplace üôÉ Also the people in the locals are wild, I am scared for my life everytime I travel, even though I travel regularly. London has 15 million people. Tokyo has 38 million people. They both have fantastic, clean and flooding-free public transportation programs. Mumbai has no excuse other than incompetence. Population density per square mile (top Google searches) Mumbai - 73,000 Tokyo - 16,480 London - 14,500 Shut up. And live in a delusion of \"amchi Mumbai\" spirit. Crowd isn't bad but somewhat conservative tho, also not as happening and not much nightlife. There's also horrible weather and water issues in some areas. Chennai is a great city, arguably the best in India if you're married with a kid on the way, but it's not a bachelor's/spinster's paradise tho. That's why many Indian redditors who are mostly in late teens/early twenties don't like Chennai compared to other metros. That's because city borders are arbritrary. When you look at the metro region population density it is comparable Mumbai - 4,764 Tokyo - 3,000 (9,700 if you look at urban density) London - 5,671 By the way, the denser the population the more cost-effective public transport is. American cities struggle with mass transit because they are a sprawled out messes. So even by your logic, mumbai should be able to afford high quality public transport even more easily. BJP is up in arms to destroy that too. They have already bought out the state government. I have asthma so it's difficult for me I think Noida will be a good choice. Especially the buildings with amenities Yes my few friends live their and it's not very safe place for woman. They want to move out from that places ASAP. And do U have any idea how the government so many times wasted the taxes they collect from hard earned people? They spent building sometimes stupid things which breaks or falls apart or money that goes into corruption feeding the politicians. I lived in Delhi too. U didn't mention the polluted air which is worse in winters, the availability of clean drinking water, overcrowded places among some others Water is bad in some areas, Central and South Chennai are better off in this regard compared to North and West Chennai Idea? Yes, many times. In fact, every government in every country does that. Is that justifiable? No. There will always be spendings made by any government across the world that is useless/waste. Is that what you are going to focus on only? God bless you then. The fact that we as citizens don‚Äôt do our part properly and expect things to be fixed by the government(regardless of whichever party) is equal to ministers being corrupt. We are also corrupt. We need to blame ourselves also. The difference between us and developed nations is, that they have enough budget that can even waste some of it and no one will bat an eye. Whereas we on the other side take loans from World Bank and IMF. Maybe lets get over the whinging and try to fix the problem. The only way to fix overpopulation in Tier 1 cities is to develop Tier 2 cities more. Madurai over Chennai for example. Yeah on this I can agree but infrastructure wise it's far far better than Mumbai. In next decade they should focus on security Well, I always try to empathize with peeps. What you said I pretty much agree, I just think maybe we should be more considerate. Yes there are definitely people who come here, use the opportunities it provides, make a living and then abuse the same. But at the end of the day, travelling everyday from Ambernath to CST is exhausting. Doing it day in day out is soul crushing. I have never done it but I can understand if people feel fed up. Are they dependent on mumbai? Yes, completely. Are they wrong to complain and get angry at mumbai? Perhaps not, because they are humans. We have emotions, ambitions, situations and so much more going behind the scenes, the subconcious, that doesnt come out when one is ranting. Tu kaunsa shampoo karti hai waise?? üòÇ Thanks for the recommendation, will try to check it out but I have soo much to read and watch I feel overwhelmed!! You get that sometimes? Idk yaar call me heartless but I have no empathy for people who choose to come here for their own matlab, put pressure on our infrastructure and then call it bad. There are people who just constantly abuse Mumbai. The food, infrastructure, real estate, even the people here. So I mean if it's so bad then they're here just for the money, right? That they're rightfully stealing from locals? Also have no empathy for people who travel so long and crib about their jobs. It's the same people who do nothing about it. I know people who hate their jobs but will not put any effort to even update their resume and looking for other jobs. I have worked in edutechs, so resume building is a skill I've picked up over the years. Man I spoonfed those people with an updated resume, helped with keywords on naukri but ek apply karne ka kaam nahi karte and they keep cribbing bout a shitty job and long travel. After that maine hath jode, nahi help karna kisiko. These people just love cribbing but don't wanna do anything to change their situation. I am not lucky I have an awesome job that let's me work as per my convenience. I applied for SO many jobs, rejected a few, got rejected by a few but man I worked my ass off just for the whole job hunting process because I wanted that comfort. >Tu kaunsa shampoo karti hai waise?? üòÇ Haha so I have jumped between Wow (apple cider vinegar and avocado), Matrix purple, Moroccanoil and brillaire. Matrix and Brillaire suit me the most. Moroccanoil gave me an allergic reaction but my hair was the softest. If I wasn't allergic to it, that'd be my first choice. I went to delhi for the first time this march. But was only there for 24 hrs so i just travelled from nizamuddin to noida via metro. Delhi metro is so good n there was no rush compared to mumbai locals but it was time consuming as locals r more faster. I have heard ppl say beware in delhi as there r pickpocketers n thugs but i had a pretty good experience. I used belive this till COVID happened. I say I 'belived' caused my eyes were opened during and post covid. You see we can already WFH in fact covid showed that it was possible to WFH if need be. But human greed is why we will never have WFH. The salary you get from jobs you do in Banglore, Delhi, Mumbai, etc. doesn't only support you and your family. It also suports others like cab driver, bus, metro, tiffin service, the fuel pump attendant, landlord, your cab driver's landlord, the barista near your office, swiggy/zomato driver, the resutant, etc. So you see huge chunk of revenue generation is removed from the economy of the city and the state if WFH is allowed. No government wants that. Because in Captialism growth is what matters no matter the cost to nature, people, etc. Offices occupying land in a city while that city not gaining enough revenue from that piece of land is the worst nightmare of any city authority. There are sooo many economic reasons for which we will never get WFH even when the technology is already there. I agree that it would crash someday. But that day is way into the future. Also Housing bubble crashing in a country's economic capital isn't good for the country as a whole. We will all feel the pain in some form if it's anything like the 2008 crash This is the way. We need more Tier 1 cities to ease out the stress on the current tier 1 cities. Your right People romanticise it because it's convenient as fuck? Like right now if I want to go meet my friend who lives 15km away I can be at this place in 1 hour ( Train+auto) and it'll cost me just Rs 100 total, and even that is because of AC train, if i go during off hours I can go in second class for Rs 10 bringing cost down to 60 or something hmm...its my lunch break, let me try to explain, its because what the other commentators said about the broken infrastructure, the insane amount of traveling (with a backup of full set of clothes no less), the prices, the lack of privacy etc. etc. so if you take a step back and view the situation as a whole... is it really an achievement....that money could have been spent improving your personal condition in many other ways if you could step out of the whole \"mumbai mayanagari\" mentality....... if your whole sense of achievement is based on the fact that you own a house in Mumbai....then i guess the only option is to laugh.... Ha psych! i always say \"With the current lot of leaders we have, India has no chance of even being mediocre, forget about being best, Get Out while you can !\" but not never anything as simple as \"India is the best\" ....we are cursed with the most inefficient political and business leadership ever seen by man Yes it is cheap but in the pursuit of remain cheap, it has made lives more cheaper that its ticket.. live with it. Nothing against the city but amount of tax mumbai pays, it doesn't reflect on its infra.. worshipping hardships doesn't solve the problem but making policy to cater ppl will do. I really don‚Äôt think so. The infrastructure is the absolute worst, people have no driving etiquette and will trample a pedestrian to get to where they want, the traffic is unmanageable and the cops lackadaisical and preying on people without fair reason. Im not partial to any city in India, I couldn‚Äôt care less about having an ‚Äúemotion‚Äù about either of these cities, as I grew up in a tier 2 city. So this is really not a Mumbai vs Bangalore debate. Bangalore is good for jobs and salaries are better than in Mumbai, but from an infra perspective Mumbai still does a better job. I‚Äôm just stating some facts here. Im happy to be challenged, but just not by someone who feels emotionally abut either city. I do live in Mumbai and experience everything in saying so, it‚Äôs 100% true for people who actually live there Your Majority of post is ranting about future projects. Go on no ones giving heed Aey kraken good to see you here as well xd Part of the reason is also because many board members, shareholders have invested in office spaces, cafeterias around the offices. If WFH becomes the norm their income would take the hit. Yes, Yogi-ji has been given the mandate to make it all safer and better. He been shooting them gangsters dead, don't you know. My city is Mumbai lol, I was just stating what I thought was right. I had visited Bangalore like 2 weeks ago so I had quite a good experience there *shrug* Jeez you seem to be an extremely motivated and driven person. Also, opinionated üòÇ I m way too soft to hold people in a bad light I guess. I'm a little scared after reading your comment ngl. I'm sure you are fun as well. People like you make me think Im so lazy. Somedays I feel like, what am I even doing with my life? Definitely not using myself to the best of ability. And then I'm like, what's even the point of life? Isnt the end goal for all we do, is to be happy? So me working 14hrs to 'realise my potential' while burning my soul, is that actually achieving someting? You get me? I think Mumbai certainly manages chaos better. Haha opinionated, yes! Motivated and driven, idk ü§≠ >Somedays I feel like, what am I even doing with my life? Definitely not using myself to the best of ability. And then I'm like, what's even the point of life? Yaar life is not so bleak or serious. Bas strive for a good work life balance, work on your skills until you get there, never stop learning but also never stop enjoying the little things in life. I'm also this opinionated at my work place (between all men) and even the most toxic of those men learned to appreciate my opinions. Idc what people say, I can't be a tame woman üôà Hence, Mumbai is not for beginners... Let that sink It feels like Metro/Mono rail is being build from centuries. The unfinished infrastructure feels ancient and it creates a lot of problems. All these inconvenience better be worth in the end. Some people's work culture and synergy is apni boss ki gand chatna. If everyone protest and convince them that there's no more value in investing in office spaces as every one want's to WFH, can't that bring a little amount of change? My company has huge campuses in Bangalore, Pune, etc. but small shuttle office in Mumbai which can seat only hundreds of people. It is only for locals who already live here, I have never met anyone who lives in pg/rent just to work in Mumbai. Well, Mumbai is known for its chaos and it has been so for decades Tbh as someone who's read Simone de Beauvoir, I am happy to see women in India who take control of their lives and ideology. You know she said that in a society steeped in patriarchy but one which is very subtle and tame about it, something akin to modern day indian metropolis, a 'good' relationship is expected as a scenario in which an intellectually firm guy who is challenged by his partner, but the girl eventually yields to his wisdom. This gives the impression that the girl is given the chance to express her thoughts and opinions, but the suitable girl is the one who will 'get convinced' eventually and internalize the patriarchal setup. A women going too strong is treated as a threat. Not only to the system but to scoeity itself. She is deemed too radical, too soon, too privileged perhaps, and so on goes the victim blaming. I think this fits so well with indian cities in general. My point being I am really happy for you. Try not to change please. Damn, you're well read and quite opinionated yourself. You should really express yourself more often. Your comment is so beautifully written that I agree wholeheartedly and have nothing more that can add value to everything you've written except, 'I absolutely agree!'. >Try not to change please. Never :)) No offence, but this mentality is killing the city, forcing everyone to come here only Students have to travel in those local trains during rush hours."
