        "* Firstly, English common law (i.e. what every modern country follows in some form) is a slow and deliberate system. Lady Justice balances the weight of two sides of facts carefully and metes out exactly appropriate punishment and ideally every criminal who has done the same crime should get the same punishment. The decisions made in every case become precedent, so, in a way you are also writing the effective laws of the land while you do your job as a judge. It's a rigorous process.\n* On top of that, the implementation of English common law that we have comes from the British who were a colonial power at the time and the system was built in a way to keep poor and uneducated Indians under the thumb. While on the surface it may look like what Britain had long ago, the ground reality is different. They introduced features for India such as a system of bribery for clerks and civil servants so that the Indians in charge of the system stayed faithful to the British. Note that if it was Japan that colonized us, we'd have a very different implementation of English common law, probably one where justice is faster. Japan has a nearly 100% conviction rate. \n* Our usual corruption, overpopulation, and laziness combines with the two problems above  makes things even worse. \n* The police system is built like a colonial occupation army. They have absolute power and lots of room to abuse it. On top of that, because of our low resources and incompetence, the police is not the best at properly following its procedures and building a proper chain of evidence and testimony which is essential for getting criminals declared guilty in court. A lot of times, judges are dealing with evidence that is inadmissible in court due to errors and lot of other edge cases.\n* Judges aren't legally required to maintain a certain pace or clear backlogs. They just deal with the cases on their own whims. Corruption is rampant with judges too, although it's not like police officers because they have a much higher standard to uphold and can easily be debarred. \n* Our laws and constitution were written by a bunch of rich kids who went to Oxbridge and tried to copy great ideas from every system and apply it on top of what the British left us with. The result is that we have some amazing laws and procedures that have lots of checks and balances, but they are so idealistic that they are hard to implement correctly in real life. The checks and balances translate in real life to just a list of people to bribe and red tape to cross to get things done. \n* Accountability norms are terribly low in all spheres of national activity, and the court isn't immune to that. Citizenry is also highly corrupt and duplicitous. After all who is it that pays the bribes? We are very comfortable with lying to each other.",
