    "selftext": "Possibly I will be be downvoted but why arranged marriage is a thing in india? \n\nI might challenge the social norms and put salt on the wound but doesn't that mean the people who pursue arranged marriage instead of love marriage lack charm and personality to pursue love marriage? And they lack the spine to challenge society and it's tradition and follow blindly what the society says and the parents do for them?\n\nI know Most of the men and women are been sexually repressed and talking about sex is considered as taboo and hell, even most rural parts of India doesn't even know about sexual education \n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/xpresblogs/lack-of-sex-ed-45433/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/22/world/sexual-repression-in-the-land-of-the-kama-sutra.html#:~:text=Girls%20and%20young%20women%20are,and%20her%20family%20is%20disgraced.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/dhruvslexicon/sex-education-still-a-taboo-in-india-2-23171/\n\nUnlike the western countries, where talking about sex doesn't matter much, but why India is backward in terms with it? It is because of religion and politics?  Why people can't find partner of their own?\n\nI mean yeah , everyone wants a bollywood filmy type marriage. But let's face the reality, half of the people can't even afford it except for the crazy rich. What parents do is that they find a girl to shackle up their life with a man they don't even know and they're expected to fall in love. I mean, what the fuck?\nAlso I think love and marriage is not always required in life, someone can be happy being single as well. It's not always doom and gloom, just change the perspective of  how you see life.",
