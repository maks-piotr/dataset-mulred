After several reported inter-ministerial discussions over the year, the Department of Telecommunications (“DoT”) has released a repackaged version of the colonial 1885 law it meant to overhaul, which continues to retain the draconian surveillance and internet suspension powers of the Union government. \n\n## Why should you care?\n\nLaws governing telecommunication services in the country have historically been used and misused to surveil our devices and suspend our internet. With changing times, these laws are also evolving, expanding the scope of applicability to new and emerging services. The [**Telecom Bill, 2022**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tX5sTSZEgo-9b3fVoInXFlUY93ZlFcYj/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) attempted to include online communication services (Signal, Zoom, Skype, Gmail) under the licensing regime historically applicable to broadcasting services. The expansion of surveillance and suspension powers from traditional broadcasting services to online communication services will cause irreparable damage to user rights and democratic freedoms.  Definitional ambiguity in the [**Telecom Bill, 2023**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U56m1jE8CsLH7GMl5DTOu3iA4TxOito8/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) leaves us worried and confused about its application to internet services. In any scenario, the bill will have implications for our fundamental right to privacy as well as our constitutional freedoms such as freedom of expression and right to receive information.\n\n## The journey of the Telecom Bill from 2022 till 2023 \n\nThe Indian Telecom Bill, 2022 was released for public consultation on September 21, 2022,  following the release of the consultation paper on the “Need for a new legal framework governing Telecommunication in India” which was published on July 23, 2022. Interestingly, the Telecom Bill, 2022, which was released merely three weeks after the conclusion of the consultation period for the paper, inserted controversial provisions, which was not present in the latter. In a response to a Right to Information (“RTI”) filed by us, the DoT [**shared**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cRUKSbOO0lzpy6ohWTKhBzCl-ezSG40H/view?usp=share_link&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) all responses it received on the consultation paper \\[Read our comments on the paper [**here**](https://static.internetfreedom.in/comments-on-the-consultation-paper-on-the/)\\]. The DoT however [**refused**](https://internetfreedom.in/https-internetfreedom-in-digital-transparency-report-for-january-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to share the comments it received on the Telecom Bill, 2022, which were invited till late last year \\[Read our comments on the paper [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/our-response-to-the-draft-telecom-bill-2022/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)\\]. The absence of such disclosures make the reasoning/inspiration behind the changes non-transparent. \n\n## Key concerns\n\n### Repackaged control, replicated language\n\nThe ‘statement of objects and reasons’ under the Telecom Bill, 2023 acknowledges the need to create a *“legal and regulatory framework that focuses on safe and secure telecommunication network that provides for digitally inclusive growth*”. According to the Telecom Bill, 2022, the aim of introducing such a bill was to ​​create a modern and future-ready comprehensive framework for the telecommunication sector in India which is currently governed by several colonial laws. While we agree with the need to reform the laws governing the sector, we dispute the approach adopted by the DoT to do so. Key provisions relating to surveillance and internet suspension, which have a long lasting, profound impact on our digital rights, have been replicated verbatim from the Telegraph Act of 1885. It will be unfair to say that the bill has not undergone changes in phrasing, but it will also be unfair to equate this change with reform. A contested provision of the Telecom Bill, 2022, i.e. licensing, has been replaced, only in name, by a concept of “authorisation”. The fundamental function of issuing authorisation is still an exclusive right of the Union government. Reliance on “public safety” and “national security” grounds to empower the Union government with powers to temporarily possess, suspend, intercept, detain any telecommunication service or telecommunication network from an authorised entity is nothing more than an old trick of the 1885 playbook.\n\n### Ambiguity around fundamental concepts of scope\n\nMuch backlash received by the DoT during the public consultation on the Telecom Bill, 2022 was around the wide definition of ‘telecommunication services’ which explicitly included a long list of online communication services. The definition of ‘telecommunication’ \\[Clause 2(p)\\] read with ‘telecommunication services’ \\[Clause 2(t)\\] is now heavily diluted and truncated, creating uncertainty about the scope of applicability to internet services. Without this clarity, it creates hindrances in foreseeing the impact on user rights and thus meaningfully responding to or analysing the bill. Such definitional ambiguity, whether or not intentional, leaves the scope wide enough for online communication services to be included within its ambit. If internet services are included in the law’s ambit, then the several alarming requirements related to surveillance, possession, suspension, authorisation, etc. will be applied to those services as well, deepening the threats to our rights and freedoms. To avoid expansion or re-interpretation of the scope in the future, the definition of telecommunication and telecommunication services, in the bill itself, must explicitly exclude internet services. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xaxguukbjg7c1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0a166d9e069e6f677922ff055df32402953826d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Threats to user privacy and rights\n\nThe Telecom Bill, 2023 deteriorates user rights in several other ways, many of which directly infringe on the user’s fundamental right to privacy. Clause 3(7) is one such privacy invading provision which imposes an obligation on any authorised entity, as notified by the Union govt, to identify the person to whom it provides telecom services, through use of any verifiable biometric based identification “as may be prescribed”. The Telegraph Act, 1885 also contained a similar provision for licensed entities, but with safeguards and specificity. Section 4(3)(a) listed the various modes of authentication that may be used by the licensee, including offline authentication, and also explicitly mentioned alternatives authentication modes to Aadhaar such as passport. The “biometric” based identification mode did not even feature in the Telecom Bill, 2022. This inclusion of “verifiable biometric based identification” raises fears that it may provide a legislative basis for the mandatory linking of Aadhaar to mobile phones which was ruled as [**unconstitutional**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by the Supreme Court of India. Thus, this provision is bereft of safeguards on many levels, but is most prominently inadequate for pushing technology solutions for a country which is still largely not digital literate. In the absence of informed understanding of how such biometric data will be used, stored, processed, and shared among majority of the public, and in the presence of a non-robust data protection act which provides wise ranging exemptions to the government, such technology should not be adopted for a routine procedure, especially in the absence of offline alternative. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9alaipdjg7c1.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b12fc17526782dc3f98531811a1ba0bf2dcb9a9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf4kpzbejg7c1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=27be8d5bd443a502b91f4f205365c41a081744f1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother potentially privacy infringing provision is Clause 29 of the Telecom Bill, 2023 which imposes a duty on users to not furnish any false information while establishing their identity for availing ‘telecommunication services’. If applicable to internet services, the ambiguous phrasing of Clause 3(7) and 29 will have damaging consequences for a user’s ability to stay anonymous while communicating. This can have a deleterious impact on vulnerable individuals such as whistleblowers and journalists, who wish to keep their identity anonymous. Services such as Twitter and Instagram, which currently provide users with the option to communicate anonymously, will possibly have to take back this facility if they wish to operate in India. The application of this clause in the context of traditional telecommunication services can be viewed from the perspective of rising cybercrime in the country. Notably, the associated penalty for failing to comply with these provisions are, i.e. up to INR 25,000 for the first offence and for the second or subsequent offences, up to INR 50,000 for every day till the contravention continues. The imposition of such hefty fines must be avoided for such clauses given the low digital literacy rates in the country as well as to avoid the misuse of the associated penalty by authorities, to coerce users into mandatorily using Aadhaar.   \n\n### Centralised executive control and powers\n\nThe ability to suspend, curtail, or revoke the authorisation or assignment in case of breach of any of its terms and conditions rests with the Union government \\[Clause 32(2)\\]. A similar provision to revoke the licence exists in the Telegraph Act, 1885, but it does not have any provisions for suspension of the licence. The entirety of Clause 20 in the Telecom Bill, 2023, whether it is the Union government’s power to temporarily possess, suspend, intercept, detain any telecommunication service \\[20(1)(a)\\], to intercept, detain, disclose, or suspend any message or class of messages \\[20(2)(a)\\], to direct suspension of any telecommunication service or class of telecommunication \\[20(2)(b)\\], or to notify encryption and data processing standards \\[19(f)\\], cements the colonial powers of the Union government, which upon misused and if extended to internet services, may become nothing less than draconian. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoyniqcljg7c1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e363a3ad0b493925eca9057db2bdabefefec30e\n\nClause 22(3) read with 2(f) empowers the Union government to notify ‘critical telecommunication infrastructure’ and issue measures related to the protection of such telecommunication networks and services. Protection measures listed include collection, analysis, and dissemination of traffic data, wherein ‘traffic data’ is defined as any data generated, transmitted, received or stored in telecommunication networks including data relating to the type, routing, duration or time of a telecommunication. This special categorisation and the Union government’s power to notify them, provide rules for their standards, and give them directions did not exist in the Telegraph Act, 1885. Thus, in addition to retaining several provisions that centralised power and control with the Executive, the Telecom Bill, 2023 has created new ones that does so. \n\nClause 43 is reflective of this effort as it confers quasi-judicial powers to any officer authorised by the Union government to “*search any building, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or place in which he has reason to believe that any unauthorised telecommunication network…. in respect of which an offence punishable under section 42 has been committed, is kept or concealed and take possession thereof.*” Such search and seizure powers are accompanied with the power to summon information, documents, or records in possession or control of any authorised entity if it is believed by the Union government to be necessary for any pending or apprehended civil or criminal proceedings \\[Clause 44\\]. Such powers, non-existent in the Telegraph Act, 1885, may be open to misuse due to its ambiguous phrasing, absence of clear parameters of information that may be revealed, and overbroad grounds for revealing information due to the use of the phrase “apprehended”. This vagueness may lead to overbroad requests for disclosure which could result in the violation of the right to privacy of users, especially if it is applicable to internet services.\n\n### Missed opportunity for surveillance and suspension reform \n\nThere is replication of language from the Telegraph Act, 1885 \\[Section 5(2)\\] to the Telecom Bill, 2023 \\[Clause 20(2)(a)\\], maintaining surveillance powers without any meaningful oversight or accountability processes. This centralises power in the Union and State Executive and is contrary to Supreme Court judgements and advances in surveillance regulations in comparative, common law jurisdictions (see [**here**](https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/surveillance-and-privacy-in-india-iv-analysing-the-landmark-pucl-judgment/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [**here**](https://privacylibrary.ccgnlud.org/case/justice-ks-puttaswamy-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), and [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/surveillance-reform-pdpb/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)). Through Clause 20(2)(b), the Telecom Bill, 2023 cements the internet suspension power with the DoT without putting in place any of the procedural safeguards directed by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India (2020) \\[3 SCC 637\\]* and the Standing Committee on Information Technology in its [**report**](https://internetfreedom.in/concerned-with-frequent-internet-suspensions-parliamentary-committee-recommends-an-overhaul/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). It also misses an opportunity to fix the shortcomings of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) [**Rules**](https://dot.gov.in/circulars/temporary-suspension-telecom-services-public-emergency-or-public-safety-rules-2017?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), 2017. If the Telecom Bill, 2023 becomes applicable to online communication services, service providers such as Whatsapp, Signal etc., which adopt the privacy protecting practice of End-to-End encryption (“E2EE”), may also be required to intercept, detain, disclose, or suspend any message, wherein \"message\" is defined as “*any sign, signal, writing, text, image, sound, video, data stream, intelligence or information sent through telecommunication*” \\[Clause 2(g)\\]. The Telecom Bill, 2023 has failed to introduce improvements in the surveillance and internet shutdown architecture of the country on the basis of privacy, transparency, and accountability.\n\n### Users in the eye of the storm\n\nThe penalty imposed on users for using unauthorised telecommunication services, either knowingly or having reason to believe it to be unauthorised, has been increased from INR 50 in the Telegraph Act, 1885 and INR 1 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2022 to a hefty 10 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2023 \\[Third Schedule\\]. The ground “having reason to believe so” may be misused and may put the user at a disadvantage as it appears to place the burden on them to prove lack of knowledge about the authorisation status of any service.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo0or8ynjg7c1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f494bc807fb82ef018d71ef41f590215b07b0ee9\n\n### Troubling patterns of delegated legislation \n\nMuch like several of the legislations and draft bills released in the recent past, the Telecom Bill, 2023 suffers from excessive delegation by according the Union government overbroad rule-making powers without introducing adequate safeguards. While some instances of delegated legislation are justifiable, even necessary, at several instances out of the total 46 instances, specificity in the Bill is left to future rulemaking. Leaving relevant clarifications open to details that “may be prescribed” or “notified” in certain instances such as providing exemption from and terms and conditions for authorisation, specifying duration, and manner of interception, disclosure, and suspension of telecommunication services, etc. contribute to increased uncertainty, vagueness, and raise concerns around arbitrary rule-making.\n\nSome improvements do exist in the Telecom Bill, 2023. For instance, an attempt to dilute TRAI’s powers with respect to the governance of this sector introduced in the Telecom Bill, 2022 has been reviewed and improved on in the 2023 bill. The controversial provision in the 2022 version allowing the identity of the sender of a message using telecommunication services to be made available to the user receiving such message, in such form as may be prescribed, has been removed in  the Telecom Bill, 2023.\n\n## #KillTheBill\n\nThe Telecom Bill, 2023, like its 2022 counterpart, has retained its [**colonial roots**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-draft-indian-telecommunication-bill/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and missed an opportune moment for bringing about reform. The DoT must thus publicly release the comments received by it during the consultation on the Telecom Bill, 2022 in the interest of transparency and accountability, so the stakeholders can gain insight into the DoT’s reasoning for holding on to provisions of an archaic law. Secondly, we urge the DoT to withdraw the Telecom Bill, 2023, and replace it with a right-centric version that protects and promotes individual rights. This version must be accompanied with a white paper/ explanatory note with justifications and reasoning for introducing any changes introduced in comparison with the Telecom Bill of 2022 as well as 2023. The DoT must also hold another consultation, that is broad, multi-city, in-person stakeholder. \n\nThe Telecom Bill, 2023 is slated for passage in the Lok Sabha today, i.e. December 20. In the absence of the crucial voice of the suspended 140+ opposition Members of Parliament and in light of the current state of chaos, disarray, protest, and walk outs in the Parliament, the Telecom Bill, 2023 must not be passed. We also recommend the Union Government to appoint a Law Commission and/or an unbiased, independent Standing Committee or expert body to look into the kinds of reforms needed for the telecommunication sector. Finally, the clarification about online communication services being excluded from the scope of the bill must be explicitly and clearly added in the text of the bill itself, and not be inserted in subsequent, not enforceable FAQs (frequently asked questions) or clarified through verbal statements by the [**Union Minister**](https://www.exchange4media.com/amp/digital-news/ott-excluded-from-telecom-services-purview-in-new-draft-of-telecom-bill-2023-131514.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), or unnamed ‘[**senior officials**](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/no-decision-yet-on-having-similar-rules-for-otts-and-telcos-official/106138191?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)’. \n\n### Important documents:\n\n1.

        "Summary:\n\n1. **Background and Development**: The Telecom Bill, 2023, introduced in the Lok Sabha, is a revamped version of the 1885 colonial law, aiming to overhaul telecommunications regulation in India. It evolved from a draft bill in 2022, with significant public and inter-ministerial consultations.\n2. **User Rights and Privacy Concerns**: The bill extends surveillance and internet suspension powers to online communication services like Signal, Zoom, Skype, and Gmail. It's criticised for potentially infringing on user rights, including privacy and freedom of expression, due to its broad and ambiguous definitions.\n3. **Surveillance and Internet Suspension Powers**: Key concerns include the replication of surveillance and internet suspension powers from the 1885 Telegraph Act, with clauses that could extend these powers to online communication services, raising fears about user privacy and democratic freedoms.\n4. **Biometric Identification and User Privacy**: The bill introduces obligations for biometric-based identification for telecom services, which may lead to mandatory Aadhaar linking, a move considered unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India.\n5. **Centralised Executive Control**: The Union government retains extensive control over telecommunications, including powers to suspend, intercept, or detain telecommunication services, which may be misused under broad and vague grounds.\n6. **Impact on Online Communication Services**: The bill's ambiguous scope could include internet services, affecting platforms that offer anonymous communication, like Twitter and Instagram, and potentially impacting journalists and whistleblowers.\n7. **Penalties and User Responsibilities**: Users might face heavy penalties for using unauthorised services, with increased fines for non-compliance.\n8. **Delegated Legislation Concerns**: The bill is critiqued for excessive delegation and vague rule-making powers to the Union government, raising issues of uncertainty and potential for arbitrary rule-making.\n9. **Call for Transparency and Reform**: Activists and stakeholders are calling for greater transparency, the release of public consultation comments, and a revision of the bill to be more rights-centric, demanding explicit exclusion of online communication services from its scope.\n10. **Legislative Process and Opposition**: The bill's passage in the Lok Sabha has been controversial, with opposition members suspended and concerns about the legislative process under current parliamentary conditions.",

        "LMAO, uae sure has freedom",
        "good luck getting a proper job in aus, their industry is shit and is going shittier as days go by. nz is still ok",
        "Bro wtf are you talking about! Like seriously do you think this is right time to bitch about Big tech's privacy concerns, this bill literally won't allow E2E, end of discussion. \nAnd no WhatsApp did not and could not share because they have only metadata of the users, this is useful in only advertising as you can guess when the user switches from WhatsApp from Insta or other Facebook products they will know when to target you. If you use the report button in a WhatsApp chat, only then WhatsApp gets access to the last 5 messages, it's no Signal but it is private. Now, Signal won't even be allowed and since Facebook makes over $2.5B from India which will keep growing, they will comply with these laws because they need that money to appease the shareholders.",
        "most of those are uncles using whatsapp and facebook lol i am talking about people on reddit",
        "i am not bitching about big tech. i just said that nothing much changed. e2e can't be blanket banned. element was banned last year but i still use it for work regularly without any issues. their implementation will be half assed as usual, i dont think they are even half as competent as china in implementing such ban. \n\nim just saying people claiming all was good before this is funny because privacy, anonymity, on reddit/whatsapp/etc/internet never existed. \n\nand if you are talking about activists, the best method now (and even before this bill is passed) is to use an outside hosted matrix server and any matrix client. unless the government just bans the internet and we go full north korea mode, e2e will never die.",
        "Bro did you even read what this new passed law says? \n\nBro if they found you using any unauthorised apps which circumvent these regulations, you will be fined. Did you read that?\n\nDo you remember how Bangalore police were stopping people on bikes and whatnot for no fucking reason and snooping through their phone. You think if such a thing happened and they found you using any of these apps, you think it's about competence? Bro you are taking all this very lightly!\n\nThis law is unconstitutional. If the Chief Justice of India had any balls he would go about ensuring every citizen's right to privacy which has been codified in the constitution. But we only get speeches from that idiot. He only gives lectures when he goes abroad but never does anything to uphold the basic enshrine of the constitution. \n\nConstitutionally important cases are being clubbed and seen by the same judge over and over and the verdict given in favor of the govt and the CJI is mum and gives fucking speeches.\n\nIt's not about these idiots being tech literate or not. Read the room buddy.",
        "the only thing i really feel bad about is for activists and journalists. its going to be very dangerous and hard for even whistleblowers within the government. low key china like. but alas, we both are just plebs on an internet site...",

        "Fuck man, someone please explain what to do now, why is this not a big deal ?",
        "I'm asking what she did that makes you think she sold her soul.",
        "You are not interpreting it correctly, Your Name does not have to be Username. You probably cannot even use your name as a username since it would already have been taken\n\nThe government can already do that, not raised but disconnect. Like how porn is banned, if you search without VPN it does not open\n\nAnd yes, the actual concerns come with this \"Authorization\" of the central government, essentially setting out borders for acceptable internet use and banning ways to circumvent the borders. Again like porn, without VPN you probably can't access proper sites in a browser, now you won't be able to access VPN as well",
        "The SC will drag the case for years while prioritizing more important questions such as whether movie theatres should pay the national anthem",
        "The fact that this “stopping brain drain” drama and banning outside travel is possible and they can do it is scary.\n\nIf you had told me this 10 years ago i would have called you crazy and nuts\n\nNow no regressive step is impossible under the garb of nationalism/patriotism and religious nationalism 🙏\n\nWe are f*kd",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Breaking: The Telecom Bill has been passed in Lok Sabha | Our First Read of the bill",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "&#x200B; [**Help us sustain the work we do**](https://internetfreedom.in/donate?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) ## tl;dr The Telecommunications Bill, 2023 (“Telecom Bill, 2023”) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 18, almost a year after the conclusion of the consultation process for its 2022 counterpart, i.e. the draft Indian Telecommunication Bill, 2022 (“Telecom Bill, 2022”). After several reported inter-ministerial discussions over the year, the Department of Telecommunications (“DoT”) has released a repackaged version of the colonial 1885 law it meant to overhaul, which continues to retain the draconian surveillance and internet suspension powers of the Union government. ## Why should you care? Laws governing telecommunication services in the country have historically been used and misused to surveil our devices and suspend our internet. With changing times, these laws are also evolving, expanding the scope of applicability to new and emerging services. The [**Telecom Bill, 2022**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tX5sTSZEgo-9b3fVoInXFlUY93ZlFcYj/view?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) attempted to include online communication services (Signal, Zoom, Skype, Gmail) under the licensing regime historically applicable to broadcasting services. The expansion of surveillance and suspension powers from traditional broadcasting services to online communication services will cause irreparable damage to user rights and democratic freedoms. Definitional ambiguity in the [**Telecom Bill, 2023**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U56m1jE8CsLH7GMl5DTOu3iA4TxOito8/view?usp=sharing&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) leaves us worried and confused about its application to internet services. In any scenario, the bill will have implications for our fundamental right to privacy as well as our constitutional freedoms such as freedom of expression and right to receive information. ## The journey of the Telecom Bill from 2022 till 2023 The Indian Telecom Bill, 2022 was released for public consultation on September 21, 2022, following the release of the consultation paper on the “Need for a new legal framework governing Telecommunication in India” which was published on July 23, 2022. Interestingly, the Telecom Bill, 2022, which was released merely three weeks after the conclusion of the consultation period for the paper, inserted controversial provisions, which was not present in the latter. In a response to a Right to Information (“RTI”) filed by us, the DoT [**shared**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cRUKSbOO0lzpy6ohWTKhBzCl-ezSG40H/view?usp=share_link&ref=static.internetfreedom.in) all responses it received on the consultation paper \\[Read our comments on the paper [**here**](https://static.internetfreedom.in/comments-on-the-consultation-paper-on-the/)\\]. The DoT however [**refused**](https://internetfreedom.in/https-internetfreedom-in-digital-transparency-report-for-january-2023/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) to share the comments it received on the Telecom Bill, 2022, which were invited till late last year \\[Read our comments on the paper [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/our-response-to-the-draft-telecom-bill-2022/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)\\]. The absence of such disclosures make the reasoning/inspiration behind the changes non-transparent. ## Key concerns ### Repackaged control, replicated language The ‘statement of objects and reasons’ under the Telecom Bill, 2023 acknowledges the need to create a *“legal and regulatory framework that focuses on safe and secure telecommunication network that provides for digitally inclusive growth*”. According to the Telecom Bill, 2022, the aim of introducing such a bill was to ​​create a modern and future-ready comprehensive framework for the telecommunication sector in India which is currently governed by several colonial laws. While we agree with the need to reform the laws governing the sector, we dispute the approach adopted by the DoT to do so. Key provisions relating to surveillance and internet suspension, which have a long lasting, profound impact on our digital rights, have been replicated verbatim from the Telegraph Act of 1885. It will be unfair to say that the bill has not undergone changes in phrasing, but it will also be unfair to equate this change with reform. A contested provision of the Telecom Bill, 2022, i.e. licensing, has been replaced, only in name, by a concept of “authorisation”. The fundamental function of issuing authorisation is still an exclusive right of the Union government. Reliance on “public safety” and “national security” grounds to empower the Union government with powers to temporarily possess, suspend, intercept, detain any telecommunication service or telecommunication network from an authorised entity is nothing more than an old trick of the 1885 playbook. ### Ambiguity around fundamental concepts of scope Much backlash received by the DoT during the public consultation on the Telecom Bill, 2022 was around the wide definition of ‘telecommunication services’ which explicitly included a long list of online communication services. The definition of ‘telecommunication’ \\[Clause 2(p)\\] read with ‘telecommunication services’ \\[Clause 2(t)\\] is now heavily diluted and truncated, creating uncertainty about the scope of applicability to internet services. Without this clarity, it creates hindrances in foreseeing the impact on user rights and thus meaningfully responding to or analysing the bill. Such definitional ambiguity, whether or not intentional, leaves the scope wide enough for online communication services to be included within its ambit. If internet services are included in the law’s ambit, then the several alarming requirements related to surveillance, possession, suspension, authorisation, etc. will be applied to those services as well, deepening the threats to our rights and freedoms. To avoid expansion or re-interpretation of the scope in the future, the definition of telecommunication and telecommunication services, in the bill itself, must explicitly exclude internet services. &#x200B; ### Threats to user privacy and rights The Telecom Bill, 2023 deteriorates user rights in several other ways, many of which directly infringe on the user’s fundamental right to privacy. Clause 3(7) is one such privacy invading provision which imposes an obligation on any authorised entity, as notified by the Union govt, to identify the person to whom it provides telecom services, through use of any verifiable biometric based identification “as may be prescribed”. The Telegraph Act, 1885 also contained a similar provision for licensed entities, but with safeguards and specificity. Section 4(3)(a) listed the various modes of authentication that may be used by the licensee, including offline authentication, and also explicitly mentioned alternatives authentication modes to Aadhaar such as passport. The “biometric” based identification mode did not even feature in the Telecom Bill, 2022. This inclusion of “verifiable biometric based identification” raises fears that it may provide a legislative basis for the mandatory linking of Aadhaar to mobile phones which was ruled as [**unconstitutional**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-verdict-supreme-court-judgment-uidai-5374829/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) by the Supreme Court of India. Thus, this provision is bereft of safeguards on many levels, but is most prominently inadequate for pushing technology solutions for a country which is still largely not digital literate. In the absence of informed understanding of how such biometric data will be used, stored, processed, and shared among majority of the public, and in the presence of a non-robust data protection act which provides wise ranging exemptions to the government, such technology should not be adopted for a routine procedure, especially in the absence of offline alternative. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; Another potentially privacy infringing provision is Clause 29 of the Telecom Bill, 2023 which imposes a duty on users to not furnish any false information while establishing their identity for availing ‘telecommunication services’. If applicable to internet services, the ambiguous phrasing of Clause 3(7) and 29 will have damaging consequences for a user’s ability to stay anonymous while communicating. This can have a deleterious impact on vulnerable individuals such as whistleblowers and journalists, who wish to keep their identity anonymous. Services such as Twitter and Instagram, which currently provide users with the option to communicate anonymously, will possibly have to take back this facility if they wish to operate in India. The application of this clause in the context of traditional telecommunication services can be viewed from the perspective of rising cybercrime in the country. Notably, the associated penalty for failing to comply with these provisions are, i.e. up to INR 25,000 for the first offence and for the second or subsequent offences, up to INR 50,000 for every day till the contravention continues. The imposition of such hefty fines must be avoided for such clauses given the low digital literacy rates in the country as well as to avoid the misuse of the associated penalty by authorities, to coerce users into mandatorily using Aadhaar. ### Centralised executive control and powers The ability to suspend, curtail, or revoke the authorisation or assignment in case of breach of any of its terms and conditions rests with the Union government \\[Clause 32(2)\\]. A similar provision to revoke the licence exists in the Telegraph Act, 1885, but it does not have any provisions for suspension of the licence. The entirety of Clause 20 in the Telecom Bill, 2023, whether it is the Union government’s power to temporarily possess, suspend, intercept, detain any telecommunication service \\[20(1)(a)\\], to intercept, detain, disclose, or suspend any message or class of messages \\[20(2)(a)\\], to direct suspension of any telecommunication service or class of telecommunication \\[20(2)(b)\\], or to notify encryption and data processing standards \\[19(f)\\], cements the colonial powers of the Union government, which upon misused and if extended to internet services, may become nothing less than draconian. &#x200B; Clause 22(3) read with 2(f) empowers the Union government to notify ‘critical telecommunication infrastructure’ and issue measures related to the protection of such telecommunication networks and services. Protection measures listed include collection, analysis, and dissemination of traffic data, wherein ‘traffic data’ is defined as any data generated, transmitted, received or stored in telecommunication networks including data relating to the type, routing, duration or time of a telecommunication. This special categorisation and the Union government’s power to notify them, provide rules for their standards, and give them directions did not exist in the Telegraph Act, 1885. Thus, in addition to retaining several provisions that centralised power and control with the Executive, the Telecom Bill, 2023 has created new ones that does so. Clause 43 is reflective of this effort as it confers quasi-judicial powers to any officer authorised by the Union government to “*search any building, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or place in which he has reason to believe that any unauthorised telecommunication network…. in respect of which an offence punishable under section 42 has been committed, is kept or concealed and take possession thereof.*” Such search and seizure powers are accompanied with the power to summon information, documents, or records in possession or control of any authorised entity if it is believed by the Union government to be necessary for any pending or apprehended civil or criminal proceedings \\[Clause 44\\]. Such powers, non-existent in the Telegraph Act, 1885, may be open to misuse due to its ambiguous phrasing, absence of clear parameters of information that may be revealed, and overbroad grounds for revealing information due to the use of the phrase “apprehended”. This vagueness may lead to overbroad requests for disclosure which could result in the violation of the right to privacy of users, especially if it is applicable to internet services. ### Missed opportunity for surveillance and suspension reform There is replication of language from the Telegraph Act, 1885 \\[Section 5(2)\\] to the Telecom Bill, 2023 \\[Clause 20(2)(a)\\], maintaining surveillance powers without any meaningful oversight or accountability processes. This centralises power in the Union and State Executive and is contrary to Supreme Court judgements and advances in surveillance regulations in comparative, common law jurisdictions (see [**here**](https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/surveillance-and-privacy-in-india-iv-analysing-the-landmark-pucl-judgment/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [**here**](https://privacylibrary.ccgnlud.org/case/justice-ks-puttaswamy-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), and [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/surveillance-reform-pdpb/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)). Through Clause 20(2)(b), the Telecom Bill, 2023 cements the internet suspension power with the DoT without putting in place any of the procedural safeguards directed by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India (2020) \\[3 SCC 637\\]* and the Standing Committee on Information Technology in its [**report**](https://internetfreedom.in/concerned-with-frequent-internet-suspensions-parliamentary-committee-recommends-an-overhaul/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in). It also misses an opportunity to fix the shortcomings of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) [**Rules**](https://dot.gov.in/circulars/temporary-suspension-telecom-services-public-emergency-or-public-safety-rules-2017?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), 2017. If the Telecom Bill, 2023 becomes applicable to online communication services, service providers such as Whatsapp, Signal etc., which adopt the privacy protecting practice of End-to-End encryption (“E2EE”), may also be required to intercept, detain, disclose, or suspend any message, wherein \"message\" is defined as “*any sign, signal, writing, text, image, sound, video, data stream, intelligence or information sent through telecommunication*” \\[Clause 2(g)\\]. The Telecom Bill, 2023 has failed to introduce improvements in the surveillance and internet shutdown architecture of the country on the basis of privacy, transparency, and accountability. ### Users in the eye of the storm The penalty imposed on users for using unauthorised telecommunication services, either knowingly or having reason to believe it to be unauthorised, has been increased from INR 50 in the Telegraph Act, 1885 and INR 1 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2022 to a hefty 10 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2023 \\[Third Schedule\\]. The ground “having reason to believe so” may be misused and may put the user at a disadvantage as it appears to place the burden on them to prove lack of knowledge about the authorisation status of any service. &#x200B; ### Troubling patterns of delegated legislation Much like several of the legislations and draft bills released in the recent past, the Telecom Bill, 2023 suffers from excessive delegation by according the Union government overbroad rule-making powers without introducing adequate safeguards. While some instances of delegated legislation are justifiable, even necessary, at several instances out of the total 46 instances, specificity in the Bill is left to future rulemaking. Leaving relevant clarifications open to details that “may be prescribed” or “notified” in certain instances such as providing exemption from and terms and conditions for authorisation, specifying duration, and manner of interception, disclosure, and suspension of telecommunication services, etc. contribute to increased uncertainty, vagueness, and raise concerns around arbitrary rule-making. Some improvements do exist in the Telecom Bill, 2023. For instance, an attempt to dilute TRAI’s powers with respect to the governance of this sector introduced in the Telecom Bill, 2022 has been reviewed and improved on in the 2023 bill. The controversial provision in the 2022 version allowing the identity of the sender of a message using telecommunication services to be made available to the user receiving such message, in such form as may be prescribed, has been removed in the Telecom Bill, 2023. ## #KillTheBill The Telecom Bill, 2023, like its 2022 counterpart, has retained its [**colonial roots**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-draft-indian-telecommunication-bill/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and missed an opportune moment for bringing about reform. The DoT must thus publicly release the comments received by it during the consultation on the Telecom Bill, 2022 in the interest of transparency and accountability, so the stakeholders can gain insight into the DoT’s reasoning for holding on to provisions of an archaic law. Secondly, we urge the DoT to withdraw the Telecom Bill, 2023, and replace it with a right-centric version that protects and promotes individual rights. This version must be accompanied with a white paper/ explanatory note with justifications and reasoning for introducing any changes introduced in comparison with the Telecom Bill of 2022 as well as 2023. The DoT must also hold another consultation, that is broad, multi-city, in-person stakeholder. The Telecom Bill, 2023 is slated for passage in the Lok Sabha today, i.e. December 20. In the absence of the crucial voice of the suspended 140+ opposition Members of Parliament and in light of the current state of chaos, disarray, protest, and walk outs in the Parliament, the Telecom Bill, 2023 must not be passed. We also recommend the Union Government to appoint a Law Commission and/or an unbiased, independent Standing Committee or expert body to look into the kinds of reforms needed for the telecommunication sector. Finally, the clarification about online communication services being excluded from the scope of the bill must be explicitly and clearly added in the text of the bill itself, and not be inserted in subsequent, not enforceable FAQs (frequently asked questions) or clarified through verbal statements by the [**Union Minister**](https://www.exchange4media.com/amp/digital-news/ott-excluded-from-telecom-services-purview-in-new-draft-of-telecom-bill-2023-131514.html?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), or unnamed ‘[**senior officials**](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/no-decision-yet-on-having-similar-rules-for-otts-and-telcos-official/106138191?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)’. ### Important documents: 1.

What does for \"using unauthorised telecommunication services\" mean ? The rajya sabah should block it You don’t go from a functioning democracy to a dictatorship in one day, you take small steps. This is a huge step, friend - repercussions are unimaginable, especially because the power lies with a bunch who have shown that they come with a serious agenda of disruption to our way of life. The citizens need to protest, voice out in every forum till the new law is revoked... remember farm law bill, CAA, etc? Any plausibility that RS blocks the bill? Yupp. Agreed. Lol VPN perhaps? Welcome to the new India. People who were not able to build toilets for 70 years for themselves will decide the future of taxpaying an educated crowd of India. Ty UP BiHar Rajasthan Utrakhand Bihar MP. Whatever they want it to mean And then people wonder why The \"Foreign Soros organisation funded by CCP against Modi\" kept India under \"Flawed democracy\" this year. I mean he asked so i told him the process. I dont think they would either This is why it's always a good time to leave this country if you can. The people in power are absolutely horrible and hell bent on destroying this country for their own greed. I hope God punishes these assholes in a spectacular way. Welcome to Rajrajya! Kaliyug was over in 2014. /s They passed it has a money bill if im not mistaken. It bypasses rs Table veto? I feel like crying rn Dude , im defenitely leaving soon. Me too Zero chance Keep voting like clowns for clowns and elect a circus. It'll be worth \"teaching Muslims a lesson\" when they eventually take your properties and money to distribute among politicians and the wealthy for \"government projects\" \"Seh lenge thoda\" As long as Muslims have it worse than us. Show your desh bhakti, enjoy living under a dictatorship. Ye Hathway & Byju's ke marketing call band karao bc abhi thodi der pehle lagatar 3 calls aaye the byjus ke What happens to reddit then? Would we be able to use it? After providing adhar Well fuck At least Reddit counts as a part of unauthorised service. Any service that lets us be anonymous. Covered in this thread. We are fucked! At least I don’t live there. Good luck guys. I’ll only worry when I come home once in 3yrs. And still be free to voice my opinion from here, almost on anything. Azadi! Gayi… Man, I am already out of the country but not with the intention of staying out forever. I strongly feel that I want to come back after a few years. It will take at least 6 more years before I finish my education. But at this pace, when I come back, I might find a totally unrecognizable India. Modi is shamelessly copying Nazi playbook. What an absolutely horrible person. I hope his own party betrays him and throws him in jail. What Discourse? What do you expect when they’ve thrown out the opposition? So no more anonymous browsing on Reddit! Hopefully I'll complete my education and leave in the next 10 years I have no hope left in this country, seriously contemplating working towards moving out of this dictatorial shit hole. ModiYug More like Modi rajya It wouldn't have gotten to this point if citizens of this country cared about this stuff in the first place. In fact, one can argue that the only reason why it has gotten this bad and draconian is because they have a blank check from the general public. Let not anyone pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. He is not a good man who, without a protest, allows wrong to be committed in his name, and with the means which he helps to supply, because he will not trouble himself to use his mind on the subject. > So....What now? :/ Nothing. This party gets absolute majority without even rigging the elections. Majority wants this party (no, you do not want to get into the nitty-gritty of total number of votes etc). Yes, you can make noise and get persecuted and prosecuted and kicked around. Not only by the Government and authorities but also by fellow citizens. You will be. It is not the case of “they don’t know what they want”. “They” know exactly what they want and they want this! The game is over, war is lost; at least for the time being. Am I being defeatist? No, I am just reading the writing on the wall aloud. Make peace or put up notional fight, which is actually admirable, but it will not change the outcome at all. (And yes, I have read René Castillo.) So, if I am interpreting this correctly, since, clause 22 requires me not to furnish false identity to avail telecommunication services, does that mean I use my real name on Reddit now? Also, as per clause 29, they are allowed to sniff my traffic so now, if they find me using VPN (falsifying my identity) to watch Netflix. By clause 43 they can raid my house now? The wording is so damn vague. Divine intervention? Raiding your house for using a vpn? That is surveillance state playbook. Day by day, slowly… the India is forever transformed.. This is what it feels like to watch democracy die. Gut wrenching, feeling powerless, hopelessness And eventually.. a bullet to the …. I've been making posts about this for a month now and literally 3 of my friends responded and even only 1 said it's bad. Most of my friends are well educated, if they don't care the masses don't fucking care either. At this point, there's literally no way this bill will not be cancelled It's annon like Electoral Bonds People are too caught up with their own lives. Many don’t have mental strength to think through stuff that is outside their regular 24/7 I suspect enforcement of this clause will largely fall on those accused of ‘anti national activities’ Turning this country into Iran and China is Modi/BJP and the RSS's dream Coming soon: The Last Election. Coming soon: The Last Election. Even modi doesn’t believe in god. He thinks himself one! So what will happen to the twitter bots? The whole world is turning into authoritarian. These are unprecedented times for sure. True. But this is massive, it will literally impact the Internet as a whole. Big brother is watching you. Without even knowing as people in India are okay with this as they've selected the \"yugpurush\". People are celebrating this under youtube comment section StudyIQ YT Channel Well what could be expected from Jio Janta nonetheless, Hope I legally migrate to some better country in upcoming 5 years Us Indians are really dumb as fuck. I feel pity. I just returned from UK to India and this mf news. I am fookin going back in 2-3 years. Can’t stay here under a dictatorship ' Literally 1984 ' memes just got real 💀💀 Lol.. if it’s got nothing to do religion or caste, no one gives a flying f. Welcome to the UP-ised India. It is. Democracy dies a slow and painful death in India ☠️ All this enforcement claims won't stop a real anti national. Just as demonitisation didn't end terror attacks Just as removing Article 370 didn't bring peace to Kashmir or better integration with rest of India These provisions will be misused against ordinary citizens, nothing more will come out of all this. Seems like the minorities are doing their part. When will the hindus stand up? It can be something as simple as WhatsApp calls to something as complex as illegal POTS connection to IP-Telephony that route international or domestic calls from IP phone to POTS /cellphone numbers. There May be even more complex systems that's beyond my technical knowledge as switching systems have evolved tremendously from the days of circuit switching or TCP/IP switching As someone who travels quite a bit overseas, it's a constant struggle to distance yourself from toxic desi migrant bhakts. Even if you're successful, you'd still have to find ways to get away from these types, since they also immigrate, and they immigrate in large quantities as well! And all it'll take is one slip of a tongue, or one typo, or one pissing off a government employee to go from national to anti-national! >since they also immigrate, and they immigrate in large quantities as well! yeah it is increasing year by year NRIs that love India but won't live in India I don't see that happening anytime soon. His party members are too loyal to him. If they legitimately or illegitimately win again in 2024, horrible times await us in the future. Not like the common public gives a damn we indians have a bit too much of this \"feel-good\" attitude Can someone please ELI5 We can always compare with Pakistan and Bangladesh to make ourselves feel good 🤷‍♂️ I am guessing data is new oil Jio wants to do a deep packet inspection of everything that passes on its network. This bills gives them the rights Why can't a PIL be filed in SC against this? Is that possible? yeppppp they spend all day on whatsapp circlejerking to \"Modiji\" but the second you ask them about moving back to India they get very quiet &#x200B; source: father is fulltime unkil now >What are we, Iran? Gonna get there Without the Chinese growth and we don't have oil either Well fuck...am currently out of the country but was hoping to comeback in a few years. Absolutely no idea where we are heading next but it all looks so dystopian. Yes, you are right data is the new oil especially for big corporates to use for their interests. I wouldn't agree more! Yes, anti national will be applied loosely to anyone criticizing the govt They are illegal now. \"Never should've come here!\" Why would they? Sarvakar openly admired the Nazis in the 1930s. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Every power this bill gives the government is a power all western nations( US, NZ, UK, Australia) already have - does this mean democracy is dead in those countries too? Stick to your day job since apparently you can’t interpret anything. Clause 22 means you cannot sign up to a telecom service using a fake identity. Clause 29 only applies if they see you using a fake identity after signing up to a telecom service, using a vpn isn’t faking your identity genius. Nothing in this bill is revolutionary or different to bills passed all across the western nations you call liberal democracies. What telecom bill did the nazis pass? What telecom bill did the nazis pass? The wording is too vague to limit it just to fake identity, the word used here is \"particulars\". Many forums explicitly mention not using real names because of potential doxings. Sure, everyone does KYC with their social securities to log into facebook, and not have end to end encryption on communication apps and are OK with it. Where did you read this breaking news no one knows about? And a whole lot of assholes asking everyone to vote for them because they have stocks holdings here, makes me wish they lose everything in life regardless. Truly scummy. Vpn Whataap University graduate hai woh bhai Yes the government can make any communication app with end to end encryption handover any and all details to them. Yes when I sign up to a telecom provider I have to provide a proof of my identity (drivers license or passport). Lol STFU - you and most of this sub talk about moving out to western states everyday where 'democracy is well and alive' but when your own government tries to implement laws these countries already have it is the end of democracy hahaha. Most of this sub is NRIs anyway, but as long as they agree with your opinions it is ok. How does using a VPN bypass biometric requirements? Because to use a VPN you still need a teleco service, who will have access to your biometric data, so you are not bypassing anything as your provider will know if you are using a VPN or not. And yes using an unauthorised teleco provider in any country is considered illegal? All nations have laws like this. *wet dream Babua bohot der ho jayegi tb tk Such sweeping statements with no substantial evidence. You're not just disconnected with India, but with reality too. You don't understand end to end encryption also. Yes, we provide IDs to sign up to internet providers, not apps, which use lesser forms of IDs like email or phone. I can't believe this is happening in my country, the country that is my home. I just can't process this. They will just pass it a second time What do you need evidence for? What don't I understand? There are multiple instances of gangs and smugglers getting caught doing illegal stuff in Australia using apps such as ANOM, Signal or WICKR because they thought the government did not have backdoor access to it. [https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018A00148](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018A00148) [https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/11/inside-story-most-daring-surveillance-sting-in-history](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/11/inside-story-most-daring-surveillance-sting-in-history) Its all in that link if you want to read it. And yes nowhere ive read in what OP has posted does it require users to provide a social security number to sign up for an app. It is just conjecture on OPS behalf. New law bad. Very, very bad. Do read what you share, almost everything requires warrants and no where it's mentioned anything related to ending encryption in communication. Hacking into someone's device is different to what's happening here. If a message or email is encrypted, it stays that way along the way until the destination. It's innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around. Buddy... it is not my fault you cannot comprehend what is written. [https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/03/31/encryption-debate-in-australia-2021-update-pub-84237](https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/03/31/encryption-debate-in-australia-2021-update-pub-84237) This bill will not change a single aspect of your life - there is not going to be someone from the ITCELL constantly monitoring your communications to see what bollywood celeb you simp for. It will jsut give the government the ability to get all comms and stored ata from service providers for people who they suspect are doing terrorist tdhings. Our indian laws require vpn providers to store data for 6 months onshore in India. Many left because of this > This thread is just full of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories lmao spoken like someone who has never dealt with the indian state or legal system. I hope to god / the gods that you never have to. If it goes to her a second time she has to pass it, it doesn’t really matter. The president has always been a powerless figure in our country I don't really have any hope left in this country tbh, got no opportunity to get out either, this is how being swamped feels like doesn't it? Falling slowly into the mud struggling only to realise its too late and you cannot climb out. Majority love the sinking feeling however You say as if a good VPN is cheap?. No free VPN is gonna provide you good protection. And even if they do there's gonna be usage and speed restrictions. VPN is not an alternative unless you're actually willing to shell out money which is not how it should be for someone just wanting to browse reddit of all the places. I'm gonna financially boycott all the companies who directly or indirectly supported bjp. The least I could do. Manmohan Singh was right about Modi turning out to be a disaster for the country. Tbh. Cities always always voted for bjp and now heavily for modi. So can’t blame this on poor people. They vote for others from time to time. What can I really do even if I care ? I think it might be worth exploring more secure options because the next five years will be worse. I hope they have to. Supporters of the state deserve to experience what they love. She's a traitor to the dalit cause, she won't do it. I am leaving this country the first chance I get. the definition of telecommunication services is so vague that it not only covers service providers but also whatever govt defines it to be like messaging apps. So, if you download a game off steam that allows you to \"communicate\" messages in chat, and this game is not authorised by govt. You can land in trouble. Never should've born here You already know why Maybe you won't be able to go, they might pass a law that only certain communities will be able to migrate outside. Under the banner of \"stopping brain drain\" ... Where are you rn ? In which country? And go where ? USA is a fascist shithole being run by same goons except white color who wants to kill you for believing the earth is not flat and vaccines work. Uae You have no idea what you are saying. I am an NRI Why there ? Is it not better to be in UE, US, or Canada ? Is there any particular reason you chose UAE over these ones ? The worst thing is it will probably get passed :( , the majority of India are modi worshippers they will support anything and we who are active on internet are probably just 0.5 per cent of the population it's sad to see such a beautiful democratic country coming to an authoritative end Seems like a good time to get out of this country for good if you value your right to privacy, freedom and free speech. It has been for a while, but this bill just accelerates that desire. Mainly better job prospects at this point of time You can't just be `howtosignuponreddit` and be anonymous on reddit any more. You have to apply to the government of india with your aadhaar information, so GoI has full information on who the heck `howtosignuponreddit` is in real life. The implication is that if you're muslim and/or post anti-modi jokes, it's off to the gulag. Bruh what the fuck is this bill? Wonder what the timeline is for them to introduce a Social Credit system like China. It's their dream I'm sure. So does this mean, GOI will ban Linux and FreeBSD for total lack of technical acuity and competence or do we have to go the Aaron Schwartz way ?? Why does the Govt. not promote the use of Raspberry Pis to poor people and have partnership with those firms ?? --- Oh wait -- The Gods, The Overlords --- Them Apples and Microsofts..... It's funny how people think lawmakers work in isolation and are ignorant about technology. The reality is that they have access to significantly more resources than we do. All VPN providers in India are obligated to log user's name, address, phone number etc. Whether you like it or not, that's how democracy works. Half the people are begging for a dictatorship Vast majority of citizens do not care. That's how it's been since first amendment which curtailed free speech. Protests against Emergency, Mandal commission, farm laws, CAA are exceptions because they directly disrupted a group of people. I did work for Hitler also in History Corruption,populism and political apathy are the 2 biggest enemies of democracy Worked for a lot of other people. In case of Hitler, Reichstag fire probably did more to help him than democracy. Yup. I call it China Lite. All of the authoritarianism and the shit stuff without the economy Agree The wording is purposely vague. Easier to play around in a gray area and have multiple interpretation of the word of law at their convenience. Dear educated people, it's time to leave India. It was great staying here, but now we know this place sucks. Like almost every other law being passed these days lol. TL DR anyone? Summary: 1. **Background and Development**: The Telecom Bill, 2023, introduced in the Lok Sabha, is a revamped version of the 1885 colonial law, aiming to overhaul telecommunications regulation in India. It evolved from a draft bill in 2022, with significant public and inter-ministerial consultations. 2. **User Rights and Privacy Concerns**: The bill extends surveillance and internet suspension powers to online communication services like Signal, Zoom, Skype, and Gmail. It's criticised for potentially infringing on user rights, including privacy and freedom of expression, due to its broad and ambiguous definitions. 3. **Surveillance and Internet Suspension Powers**: Key concerns include the replication of surveillance and internet suspension powers from the 1885 Telegraph Act, with clauses that could extend these powers to online communication services, raising fears about user privacy and democratic freedoms. 4. **Biometric Identification and User Privacy**: The bill introduces obligations for biometric-based identification for telecom services, which may lead to mandatory Aadhaar linking, a move considered unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India. 5. **Centralised Executive Control**: The Union government retains extensive control over telecommunications, including powers to suspend, intercept, or detain telecommunication services, which may be misused under broad and vague grounds. 6. **Impact on Online Communication Services**: The bill's ambiguous scope could include internet services, affecting platforms that offer anonymous communication, like Twitter and Instagram, and potentially impacting journalists and whistleblowers. 7. **Penalties and User Responsibilities**: Users might face heavy penalties for using unauthorised services, with increased fines for non-compliance. 8. **Delegated Legislation Concerns**: The bill is critiqued for excessive delegation and vague rule-making powers to the Union government, raising issues of uncertainty and potential for arbitrary rule-making. 9. **Call for Transparency and Reform**: Activists and stakeholders are calling for greater transparency, the release of public consultation comments, and a revision of the bill to be more rights-centric, demanding explicit exclusion of online communication services from its scope. 10. **Legislative Process and Opposition**: The bill's passage in the Lok Sabha has been controversial, with opposition members suspended and concerns about the legislative process under current parliamentary conditions. Yes. Just that dictatorship has been renamed as Amritkaal or marketed as Hinduraaj. Have your heard about Proton VPN? Then Chaddis will come forward to justify this with the argument that if Irani Muslims can do this, we can do this to the Indian Muslims. I know my comment doesn't make much sense but so do the Chaddi logics. Yes. I use it. I actually use Windscribe and highly recommend it but I don't know what its offers are. I lucked out with 50GB per month for life usage promotion they had running in the early days. My problem with VPNs is that you never get your full download speed with them. Windscribe has improved quite massively since then and now I actually get up to 5 Mbps download speed which is quite impressive for me. Ram mandir enters the chat It’s like jenga.. you remove individual blocks and the structure holds up fine until that one block suddenly brings the wooden tower crashing down. That is only if they operate servers in india, only then they have to answer to the indian judiciary I am not exactly a security expert but accoding to my layman \"research\" Proton VPN is pretty secure and I get full download speeds which is 90Mbps. I pay for 100 Mbps so its pretty much equal. Well, we've stopped comparing ourselves with Bangladesh lately because they seem to be doing better than us. As if the SC will do anything about it other than giving a clean chit to their masters and ruling the act \"constitutional\" We can if we use tor network.. I think there are unofficial instances of reddit in tor network Damn. You lucky then cos Proton VPN doesn't even give me 1. LOL. It's not stable is what I'm trying to say. And yes Proton VPN is still quite the safest alternative out there especially from the free ones. I actually contemplated buying it cos use their email service regularly for anything that's not formal. And please check out Windscribe at least be on the look out for offers. 50GB VPN backup is great. >What are we, Iran? Even better.. We will become North Korea. They can't raid a million houses a day.. Fuck them.. All they can do is suspend internet As of now Bangladesh is doing better than us on some fronts. It's vague by design - majority of people have all the freedom in the world to continue doing everything they want. However, should you do something that panauti mantri doesn't approve of, they now have cause to raid your house, and put you in jail. Well the problem with me is I cant afford any Paid VPN (Student here).Even I was surprised how a free VPN is giving me such high speeds. Will try Windscribe if it has a trial period though. Thanks for the suggestion. freedom of speech at its finest. Oh shit sorry. I forgot to mention the biggest thing. It's free too. LOL. Hahaha. Yeah. I can see why the offer thing confused you. I meant 50GB for a free account. Not paid. I ain't paying shit either. By promotion that's what I meant. The free account has a different limit but during promotions they give away a code which upgrades you to 50 for no cost. So up next \"The next great cyber wall of India\" > Breaking: The Telecom Bill has been passed in Lok Sabha FTFY: Breaking: The Telecom Bill has been proclaimed in the New Parliament Building after kicking out all the dissidents. What is more sad none of the leading newspapers are covering this. This should be on front page! ONLY if you say \"Modiji's rule and his govt is the best in the world and should remain forever\" ANYTHING bad you can think of regarding this bill treat it as true. Raiding your house, confiscating your laptop, issuing an FIR and a court summons because you tweeted something you didn't like the govt is doing will be par for the course and lakhs of bhakts will cheer for this. I wonder if the government will \"authorise\" MMOs like league of legends or world of warcraft, cause i can sure communicate over it Next thing you know police is at my door because I played Minecraft It's coming just wait for more 2 yrs CBDC linked to social credit score. Unauthorised comms is not defined in the act. But authorised comms are defined. Basically those guys who are registered as telecom service providers, telecom service operators and radio equipment owner. They need to get registered with the CG. Then they can do whatever they want within the preview of the act. So all those who have rejected certification are unauthorised ones. So if reddit gets the certification they can run. Right now we all are anons but reddit still has a email account/IP address with them in their records as of now. So we ain't exactly anonymous. -10,000 social credit for your username mocking Supreme Leader Really, why is she a traitor? Basically this is going on earth now If you see other countries government's are trying to control people they want to be the big boss. Follow/Obey or perish Opposition? They come in power then they will also do same Remember governments want control now 😂😈🤡 Privacy is at risk- Wait 50GB for free! For how long? Man when they rolled out aadhar, some conspiracy theorist friends of mine said this would be used to kill internet privacy in India. I laughed at them then. Looks like I owe them an apology. Sad reality. Sold her soul to the very people who subjugate and control us, all to be a glorified rubber stamp. is this bill include signal, telegram ? The ISP knows when you connect to TOR, which will never get \"authorised\" by the government. So until you use a bridge, TOR will be as legal as any unauthorised telecommunication services (ie 10L fine) Cybersecurity guy here, I really don't know what this government is even planning to do- [first blocking required necessary sites](https://www.medianama.com/2023/11/223-github-subdomain-blocked-isps/), [VPN Data Law](https://www.cloudwards.net/vpn-ban-in-india/) which made a lot of VPN providers move their servers from India and now this. This is a severe threat to our privacy and freedom on the Internet. And the recent data breaches which have occurred has made me believe we can't trust this government with our data at all. I don't know how this is \"democracy\" where we can't even communicate to each other without being tracked and put under surveillance. As far as I have read & as u/GrimReaper_97 said in another comment using so-called unauthorized services (like - Matrix, Signal & Session) to communicate will be a finable offence. Privacy is our primary right - taking it away in the name of \"national security\" doesn't make any sense. I even feel unsafe as I'm writing this comment. I literally am bamboozled to read about this bill which is stripping away our privacy, freedom and everything. This decision will effect journalists, cybersecurity researchers and countless other people. Our freedom is being targeted. I am sorry, but can I get a TLDR version as well? Also, in today's time, you may need to convey this using Instagram reels as well. For me?. Lifetime lmao. End of privacy in India, as we know it. Why is mainstream media not covering this? Wow thats nice They'll probably tax internet usage next and OF COURSE they'll monitor conversations there. But in India it's also difficult to not be politically apathetic because there is nothing the common man can do to actually change the course of politics in the country for the better. Our options are to choose between one government who advocates for religious fascism, and the other who will suck out our tax money and use it to pay for personal expenses. The day JNU stopped protesting, this country was gone. This is such a fucked up law. Bye bye E2E. Another reason to leave this shithole of a country. Australia, NZ Reddit has an official Tor instance, see [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/s/nmr3la3xeq) I can't believe there are IAS aspirants who watch that channel. No wonder most IAS are bhakts. I also get full speed in proton vpn free using from years their no log policy is great but jio 4g/5g user will not get full speed hence they would not believe it It's actually **5 years** instead of 6 months. [Source](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/vpn-services-in-india-to-store-user-data-for-5-years-all-you-need-to-know-7900339/) Literally The Vernacular Press Act Give your aadhaar, PAN, DL, etc if you want to use your phone😂 yeah this sounds so much like an avg day in bjp ruled india that we'd imagine. Made a mistake mate. Will correct it soon. >Users in the eye of the storm > >The penalty imposed on users for using unauthorised telecommunication services, either knowingly or having reason to believe it to be unauthorised, has been increased from INR 50 in the Telegraph Act, 1885 and INR 1 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2022 to a hefty 10 Lakh in the Telecom Bill, 2023 \\[Third Schedule\\]. The ground “having reason to believe so” may be misused and may put the user at a disadvantage as it appears to place the burden on them to prove lack of knowledge about the authorisation status of any service. &#x200B; This post has written that a fine will be imposed if you use any medium of communication that the government does not ~~monitor~~ authorize. It is much more of News Channel There is no way we have 16M+ active IAS aspirants watching that YT Channel Everyone knows watching videos won't do anything do your preparation IAS are bureaucrats who r ~~corrupt~~ asf They have to show support to the government for their \"business\" Nope...check recently Their per capita again lower than us. Not a far cry. However, nobody will dare to be as cunning and ruthless as BJ Party is today unless your endgame is to weed out democracy and install dictatorship. Remember, even Kim Jong Un doesn’t win elections with absolute majority in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. He wins by 98-99% majority to keep the veil of democracy in DPRK alive. Behaving worse than Un is not a good sign for the country. Only if they can recognize it.. Tor has bridges which help us browse like a normal user.. I will try to use bridges depending on the situation. Thank you Yeah, that is if you connect to tor directly but if you use bridges , ISP can't recognise that we are using tor network. Check out tor website for Better explanation. At the bottom of the post there are links to official statements by ministry that clarify that the bill only covers Telco providers and not OTT services such as Whatsapp. They reason that this bill is from Ministry of I&B, whereas OTT and other internet services are under Ministry of IT. I agree with IFF here that such statements even if genuine should be encoded into the language of the bill to prevent future expansion or re-interpretation. And that is something we should fight for, but no need to spread fear and uncertainty.

And that is something we should fight for, but no need to spread fear and uncertainty. they are too incompetent for that It feels surreal. normally when I use Tails, I never thought I'd have to send an empty email to TOR to request a Tor relay. There are forums like reddit (drea....brad.onion) but most of these are drug market related was never anonymous, tbh nothing is anonymous not really, macro data only looked good for few quarters during covid people will come up with somethign... lol. imagine a \"shim\" like app that uses whatsapp to send \"double encrypted\" messages xD It was never really anonymous. If govt wants they can easily contact reddit, ISP and trace your posts back to you fairly easily. They just made it easier now and streamlined the process more than half of india is already on the internet, 0.5 dafaq wait so, what should she do E2E in any big tech platform is a joke. Whatsapp even before this bill easily complied with authorities and shared messages with authorities. all they did is just streamline the process and make it easier. LMAO, uae sure has freedom good luck getting a proper job in aus, their industry is shit and is going shittier as days go by. nz is still ok Bro wtf are you talking about! Like seriously do you think this is right time to bitch about Big tech's privacy concerns, this bill literally won't allow E2E, end of discussion. And no WhatsApp did not and could not share because they have only metadata of the users, this is useful in only advertising as you can guess when the user switches from WhatsApp from Insta or other Facebook products they will know when to target you. If you use the report button in a WhatsApp chat, only then WhatsApp gets access to the last 5 messages, it's no Signal but it is private. Now, Signal won't even be allowed and since Facebook makes over $2.5B from India which will keep growing, they will comply with these laws because they need that money to appease the shareholders. most of those are uncles using whatsapp and facebook lol i am talking about people on reddit i am not bitching about big tech. i just said that nothing much changed. e2e can't be blanket banned. element was banned last year but i still use it for work regularly without any issues. their implementation will be half assed as usual, i dont think they are even half as competent as china in implementing such ban. im just saying people claiming all was good before this is funny because privacy, anonymity, on reddit/whatsapp/etc/internet never existed. and if you are talking about activists, the best method now (and even before this bill is passed) is to use an outside hosted matrix server and any matrix client. unless the government just bans the internet and we go full north korea mode, e2e will never die. Bro did you even read what this new passed law says? Bro if they found you using any unauthorised apps which circumvent these regulations, you will be fined. Did you read that? Do you remember how Bangalore police were stopping people on bikes and whatnot for no fucking reason and snooping through their phone. You think if such a thing happened and they found you using any of these apps, you think it's about competence? Bro you are taking all this very lightly! This law is unconstitutional. If the Chief Justice of India had any balls he would go about ensuring every citizen's right to privacy which has been codified in the constitution. But we only get speeches from that idiot. He only gives lectures when he goes abroad but never does anything to uphold the basic enshrine of the constitution. Constitutionally important cases are being clubbed and seen by the same judge over and over and the verdict given in favor of the govt and the CJI is mum and gives fucking speeches. It's not about these idiots being tech literate or not. Read the room buddy. the only thing i really feel bad about is for activists and journalists. its going to be very dangerous and hard for even whistleblowers within the government. low key china like. but alas, we both are just plebs on an internet site... You don't sell your soul to the government. Well, they seem confident in whatever they are saying. You hope that works in the future, but the future seems bleak to me. Yeah. I feel the same.. But resistance emerges when there is oppression too. Oh and btw, don't even dream of challenging this is in the SC. You'll most likely be fined for wasting the court's time, hear \"Heil Modi\" followed by your plea being junked. how to use bridge on phone? yeah but Internet is literally a basic human need at this point man, we literally do everything on it. Fuck man, someone please explain what to do now, why is this not a big deal ? I'm asking what she did that makes you think she sold her soul. You are not interpreting it correctly, Your Name does not have to be Username. You probably cannot even use your name as a username since it would already have been taken The government can already do that, not raised but disconnect. Like how porn is banned, if you search without VPN it does not open And yes, the actual concerns come with this \"Authorization\" of the central government, essentially setting out borders for acceptable internet use and banning ways to circumvent the borders. Again like porn, without VPN you probably can't access proper sites in a browser, now you won't be able to access VPN as well The SC will drag the case for years while prioritizing more important questions such as whether movie theatres should pay the national anthem The fact that this “stopping brain drain” drama and banning outside travel is possible and they can do it is scary. If you had told me this 10 years ago i would have called you crazy and nuts Now no regressive step is impossible under the garb of nationalism/patriotism and religious nationalism 🙏 We are f*kd Only certain group of people will be allowed to migrate outside I guess. If that ever happens that is. Have you linked your Aadhaar? elect a clown expect a circus. Enjoy wearing neck belts idiots. Sad that I have to become a dog just like cunts who voted to clowns"
