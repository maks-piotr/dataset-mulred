        "She is an actress, she does what the script says without shame!",
        "Here’s what Smriti Irani said about the Global Hunger Index\n\nThe Union minister claimed that some indices, including the Global Hunger Index, do “not project the India story” deliberately.\n\"How do they build that index? 3000 people from a country of 140 crore get a phone call from Gallup and they are asked, 'Are you hungry'?\" she said.\n“Now trust me, I have left my house in Delhi in the morning at 4. I caught a flight at 5 to go to Kochi. I did a conclave there, caught a flight at 5 o'clock to come to this programme. By the time I get to anything called food, it will be 10 o'clock. If you have called me anytime in the day today and asked are you hungry, I'll say 'Oh yes, I am'.”",
        "Same logic as Nirmala and her not buying onions.\n\nAnd the index isn’t just asking 3000 people",
        "Who tf keeps voting for her?",
        "Cylindrella.",
        "People are not stupid. Unless you are in the top 0.0001% bubble, everyone has seen how prices have increased, how expenses and bills have gone up, how taxes have increased etc. \n\nIt’s been a decade of Acche Din now. Has the material conditions of the average person changed since then?\n\nThe only question is are they gonna blame all this on anti nationals/Soros/foreign interference and buy into the Hindutva hysteria and vote for the same again?",
        "Their target audience neither have critical thinking skills, nor do they know how surveys work, nor do they relate with hunger and malnutrition. The minister is just preaching to the choir.",
        "Ram mandir will be inagurated before the elections. And a few factories for semiconductor production in Gujarat. That’s a winning combination in gGJ, eUp, and a few other places.\n\nFor the rest of India, our objective should be to vote against those who have taken the country back by at least 20 years in terms of unity, culture, and science. Those who still support the perpetrators of religious, cultural atrocities are the real anti nationals.",
        "No improvisation also.",
        "She is a loser who has been with RSS since the age of 5 and never got to know the difference between a college degree and  a workshop participation certificate. Calling her an actor is giving her too much credit.",
        "Looking at her physique, at best she is hungry for power...",
        "This is the problem when one has never seen the inside of a college",
        "Crowdwork only",
        "Damn I didn't know she was inducted that early",
        "Bhook bhi kabhi malnutrition thi",
        "I want to agree with you on this. However, your primary assumption is wrong. People in this country are very much stupid and gullible. So, while the truth is out there for everyone to see. \"People\" will shut their eyes on command and pretend it never happened.",
        "Also, they aren't asking if you feel like snacking rn because you got up early. Lol",
        "Even worse answer than \"Dharavi ke logon se survey le liye hain\"",
        "Hungry, media rights. No issues in India. All perfect. \n\nRest of the world hates India, that’s why poor rankings.. bla bla bla \n\nOnly in govt can you get away with childlike excuses for all your failures.",
        "Yo mama so fat",
        "This woman acted like the  the biggest proponent of \"Indian pride\" and sent her kids to foreign universities...\n\n\n\nHow she managed to become a prominent figure in BJP I have no idea.",
        "The lack of empathy in that quote is mind numbing.",
        "All the Tulsi Virani fans",
        "Hunger index keeps track of her evening snacks to measure its impact on world food supply.",
        "Smriti Irani so fat",
        "She looks very well fed.",
        "Musk called himself homeless since he was sleeping at a friend's house regularly.\n\nThis is just a diversionary tactic used by the powerful to sow doubt into polls/ studies etc.\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-twitter-house-net-worth-b2060186.html",
        "You have no idea, how many WhatsApp supports the BJP.\n\nI have no idea why these uncles have so much hate in them, it genuinely baffles me.",
        "By that very hypocrisy!",
        "Ummm... Taking the county 20 years back would actually be a huge improvement. India was thriving in the 90's and early 2000's.  Even after the 2002 riots, Atal didn't allow the violence to spread and allowed the courts or do it's job (and that's why the rest of BJP had their knives out for him). \n\nWhat Modi has done is taken India back to partition time in terms of religious tensions and a sense of insecurity to the minorities.",
        "> “Now trust me, I have left my house in Delhi in the morning at 4. I caught a flight at 5 to go to Kochi. I did a conclave there, caught a flight at 5 o'clock to come to this programme.

She clearly hasn’t ever travelled the countryside in any state. The silver lining is when politicians loose complete touch with reality…they have reached the twilight of their careers.",
        "I apologise in advance for this personal attack 🙏, I would never say this if it weren't reddit. \n\nNobody looking at her would believe she is hungry.\nr/technicallythetruth\n\nI am sorry again. Fat shaming is wrong.",
        "Classic ad hominem attack strategy. I am right because I am more powerful. Power abuse is the principle of this party just like pre-2014 Congress. \n\nBtw where was Irani when LPG prices rose to 800. She's an embarrassment serving the Indian public not the people bringing problems to notice.",
        "I don’t get it. Politicians do everything but the actual work.",
