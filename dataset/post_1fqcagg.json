        "Those projects are going the GIFT city way: massive waste on infrastructure no one is interested in followed by holding guns to people heads to move their to kill their businesses. ",
        "they need massive resources such as water. bangalore and surrounding areas arent viable, if that's the place that usually comes to the mind.",
        "Karnataka is not just Bengaluru. And Gujarat is not famous for its water bodies.",
        "Gujarat is not exactly the place which comes to mind when you think of water.",

        "Do you want to see the future? Just google what's happening with \"worlds largest office\" and see the future of this.",
        "> ‘No ecosystem there’ ???\n\nMore like ‘No TRAFFIC JAMS and urban sprawl and flooded streets there’...",
        "There is a difference here, they are not building infra like GIFT. Just giving incentives. GIFT was more a real estate grift and finance is no way comparable to manufacturing. \n\nCompanies will build plants there because they are low end ones and most stuff is automated now. The top end jobs will stay where the talent is(Bangalore/Hyderabad). Some mid level jobs will move.\n\nMicron is already hiring for GJ plant so it is far more real than GIFT ever was.",
        "What is this clown yapping about?…Karnataka received 9x more fdi inflows than gujarat in fy 2023-2024…Not everything has to go karnataka...Karnataka and maharashtra received about 60% of the total fdi…Its high time govt starts prioritizing other states. https://www.india-briefing.com/news/fdi-landscape-in-india-fy-2023-24-a-state-sector-analysis-33445.html/",
        "Yeah, absolutely no floods in Assam and Gujarat. Please google what happened there during the recent rains.",
        "But unless forced who will go around and invest in places with no infrastructure.\n\nLike are you going to buy a property in Manipur just because no one is buying there?",
        "\"Incentives\" is basically paying the corporations to build there after giving them free land. This is a gruff similar to GIFT. Micron and others make money \"setting up\", declare unfeasibly given lack of supply chain and talent, and we're left holding the bag for empty skeletons that cost us 1000x what they're worth. \n\n\nRinse and repeat. ",
        "Because politics. Absolutely valid points.",
        "i did not mention  that Gujarat is a good or appropriate choice. Dont extend your ignorance and incompetence to perceive your thoughts as mine.",

        "The same thing can happen anywhere. Now some of the projects will surely die but some will work. It's just a numbers game at that point. The lower end ones have a higher probability of working because there is enough local demand.\n\nI know people love hating on Gujarat but they have had success in manufacturing.",

        "You realize gujarat has the second most factories in india and accounts for 18% of the total industrial output of the country? How is is that a state with no infrastructure account for the most industrial output? Gujarat has far better infrastructure than most other states for industrial production. Ports, roads, water availability and stable electric grid. https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/data-stories/data-focus/tamil-nadu-has-the-highest-number-of-factories-but-lags-in-industrial-output-gujarat-leads-the-pack/article67946705.ece",

        "I tried using what’s written in article. \n\nInfra and ecosystem is surrounding semi conductor manufacturing not roads and ports.\n\nGujarat has a lot of industrial output. I’m not denying that. My point is even though Gujarat has a lot of output it’s primarily driven by oil and its by product sources. Like polymers, petroleum, paint etc. \n\nBut not IT, mechanical industries etc. \n\nThe reason is because they don’t get enough people or skill there to sustain running that industry. \n\nThe reason why majority of pharma companies are in Chandigarh belt or auto mobile manufacturing is in Tamil Nadu, Bengal belt and textile manufacturing is in south is because they save up a lot on costs and they get people with that skill so that they don’t waste money on training people or waiting for new grads to start working.",
        "They want to demand all high paying tech and semconductor jobs in karntaka and also want to pass stupid policies like the job reservation bill.",

        "Assam? Because why wouldn’t you place your strategic multi billion dollar assets within 30 minute flying time of PLAAF air bases?",
        "While it doesn’t HAVE to go to Karnataka all the time, it is equally true that it doesn’t HAVE to go to Gujarat all the time. It is toxic both ways.",
        "Because there is an ecosystem in Bangalore. Tho there is one in Pune, Hydrabad and Chennai, and a small one in Kolkata too, see how that has expanded?",
        "Er, I posted multiple states. And er, lack of man power in a state happens because of its lack of competitiveness of wages among other things. ",
        "Gujarat and racist Gujaratis already do that while not being even half as good as Bengaluru. What is your point?",
        "They are not allowed to have non veg food in Gujarat.",
        "Point is, Karnataka can be better.\n\nThis argument is same as RW gives - \"pakistan kills hindus.. so why cant we...\"",
        "I think it's bogus argument here presented by the minister.\n\n1. Just because Karnataka has been a great manufacturer doesn't mean other states don't need to develop. Equitable development can occur along with training of people in other states as well. \n2. In India skillet moves with good opportunities. Just see how much Bangaloreans complain about Non Kannadigas. People can be trained and employment can be generated. \n3. Companies mostly choose where they want to setup such industries because of the incentives they get. Did Karnataka govt. fail to provide competitive incentives?\n4. I do like that North Eastern state is getting good projects that will lead to employment in the region. Stop punching down.",
        "> maharashtra which had the necessary resources and talent\n\nMH might have marginally more talent but resource wise it is similar. If you want to do allocation based on past performance in electronics manufacturing then TN and UP should be the top contenders.",
        "Now tell us what fraction of manufacturing jobs are in gujarat. 18?",
        "correct me if I'm wrong, people in gujarat dont refrain from doing blue collar job. I have stayed there n have friends in rural n urban regions. the majdoors there r well taken care of in a lot of fields. be it farming or anything. even wedding ones. while I can surely say, in maharashtra, people here refrain from doing blue collar job n hence outsourcing.",
        "like u said, it has become a fashion to hate on gujarat bcoz people not liking modi shah. I have statyed there, the poor there hve been \"pampered\" since modi days. dude's popularity was like anything when i was a kid n didnt know what bjp n modi was. people with glee used to openly say they r gonna vote for modi. v happened to stay in rural area bcoz of posting. \n\nanother thing is today every oppostion party wants to play some tune during such announcements. maharashtra is gonna get some port n had massive investment announcements few days ago. some project was announced in TN, correct me if I'm wrong.",
        "But people who work in semiconductor industry don't know kannada hence decision made to move outside",

        "Semiconductor manufacture requires lot of water, so why in Karnataka with drinking water issues vs Gujrat with flooding issues?",
        "What a braindead logic ! So according  to your 'wisdom', states close  to enemy  countries should not have any  industry/development ? Industries  should be setup only in South India? And then cry about outsiders coming to your state for jobs? \n\nBy your logic, should the capital be shifted from New Delhi to South India since New Delhi is only 300 km from china border  and it comes under range of their s-400 air defence?",
        "Yes because we get regularly bombed by the PLAAF and should just vacate Assam",
        "it’s good they are not coming here, already bangalore is highly crowded, they will make the office near airport where lakhs of employees will commute without public infra and lead to traffic jams.",
        "yup and then say us to go outside karnataka to other states if we cannot speed kannada and call us names.",
        "These infighting will ensure that India will never have a decent semiconductor industry.\n\nCompanies have an upper hand as they will go to places where they get the most support and benefits from govts.",
        "Dont bring chip manufacturing to a state coz of political reason , rather coz of education, human resources availability of other supporting industry. Dont make those in to least human resourceful states.",
        "would you ask the semiconductor units in KA also to write all specifications,  manuals and all correspondence in kannada only ? if not then you are a hypocrite. lol",
        "Just because the ecosystem is not there right now doesn't mean they shouldn't try to make a new one on their own.",
        "People who are questioning his way of putting, \"has\" to happen in karnataka is not wrong.\n\nWhen you are building something new, you need to setup shop where the talent and resources are within reach. Who the fuck wants to go to live in Gujarat? Are you kidding me?\n\nThere is no culture of night clubs, comedy shows, beer, good quality restaurantents which will serve anything and everything (they will fucking kill you if you serve beef there) etc. Tech jobs command high salary and that in itself creates an ecosystem of things you can enjoy with that money. Ask anyone in bangalore if they'd accept a job in gujarat. They won't.",
        "It's natural for locals expect other to speak in their language. But in India your employer expects so much from you. After 70 hours of work per weak you literally have no energy for anything productive. After a certain age it's really difficult to learn a new language too. \n\nBut it's not even about that. And it's not something new. When quora used to be at it's peak, like a decade ago even then I remember reading such things about \"northies\".",
        "true, already in mncs we have to work so much, everyone knows about EY suicide, apart from this learn some other language.",
        "You know Karnataka is not only benguluru right ? The news you are seeing about water issues is probably from the Bengaluru surroundings. \n\nThere is places in Karnataka which have more than enough water.",
        "In Karnataka, it will be semi-kanaddactur.",
        "Very good question. Diamonds and extremism doesnt create semiconductor units.",
        "If that is case why not Kerala?",
        "Correct. There were multiple contenders based on different cree m criteria. Yet, the goverment forced the project to move from maharashtra to gujarat. ",

There was no pampering of the poor. Poor, middle class, and the rich alike were fed hatred and false pride. Garvi gujarat's pride was showing Muslims their place and claiming to be developed while the hdi languished amongst bimaru states. If you asked those proudly proclaiming greatness of gujarat to talk about how their lives had been improved, they couldn't come up with a single important thing, and ended up with \"but landias have been shown their place!\"\n\n\n>any1 who wants to develop n setup company in their states, they can do it. until n unless they dont \"actually \" want to.\n\n\nThis is a bullshit claim, and you know plenty of examples of corporations being forced to move to gujarat after announcing plans to set up in other states. ",
        "Work on your reading comprehension. No one said the manufacturing units were going to be set up in the ghost town. ",
        "Yes chips speak in kannad, so it has to happen there.",
        "So that kannads can keep attacking more migrants, they need to do something in life.",
        "Gujarat better than kannadistan, these clowns attack outsiders everyday, at least Gujjus are not attacking outsiders everyday.",
        "Yes and then they will force companies to hire kannad goons, who will then harass everyone inside the company.",
        "I agree, but Bangalore has too much trouble with non kannadigas. So better to build somewhere else",
        ">correct me if I'm wrong, people in gujarat dont refrain from doing blue collar job. I have stayed there n have friends in rural n urban regions. \n\n\nThat is true everywhere for people without degrees and ancestral wealth. They don't have an option to refrain from doing blue collar jobs. \n\n\n\n\n\n>the majdoors there r well taken care of in a lot of fields.\n\n\nThis is bullshit. Minimum wages is maharashtra are 1.5 times those in gujarat, and daily wage laborers are paid far less in gujarat the maharashtra. \n\n\n>while I can surely say, in maharashtra, people here refrain from doing blue collar job n hence outsourcing.\n\n\nHigher proportion of population in maharashtra has college degrees, and avoid blue collar work, but that is still a small fraction of the population.  In general, the reason why there are plenty of immigrants is because the wages are higher than exploitative wages in gujarat. ",
        "Semiconductor kya, India will demolish existing industries simply because of this internal bickering that these guys do. And public as we know of this country are puppets of the ministerial puppeteers.",
        "Labor issues man, saying this as a Keralite.\n\nAlso we don't have much space in acres or hectares for manufacturing plants.",
        "They should not have any vital industries that are of strategic importance.",
        "You do realise that Gujaratis are extremely discriminatory when it comes to real estate and housing? They don’t just do this in Gujarat, they take over neighbourhoods and force locals out. This happens in Mumbai, London and Toronto, why wouldn’t it happen in this dystopian city? Where are “outsiders supposed to live?",
        "Why not Andra?",
        "U act like as if tho it's upto panwaalas to decide. The question he is raising is why the central government acts in favour of a certain state. If so why should one remain this union?",
        "Priyank Kharge’s statement about Gujarat and Assam lacking the ecosystem for semiconductor manufacturing is another divisive comment from a minister who often stirs hostility. His bias against non-Kannada speakers living in Karnataka has previously sparked tensions, and his current rhetoric aims to create regional divides. While he claims that Karnataka deserves semiconductor units, this ignores the national interest and reduces the argument to political favoritism. Kharge’s approach undermines unity and risks Karnataka’s reputation as a cooperative state. I’m from Karnataka, and we deserve better representation.",
        "I don't have a problem with him questioning, but i do have a problem with him saying it has to be in Karnataka",
        "And no such place, with sufficient water supply, exists elsewhere in the country, correct?",

        "This is just start. As of now officially Gujarat and Assam has been chosen for it. UP too based on US and India tie up. Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra depending on which company will take the project. From what I read, Adani is doing it in Maharasthra but not sure.",
        "Yes they are, but Gujjus are not attacking outsiders on a day to day basis, once again it doesn't happen to all outsiders, for example in Ahmedabad tons of outsiders live in peace, can't say that in case of Bangalore where goons harass for not being kannad.",
        "lol you actually justifying housing discrimination. Gujarat has a lot of issues and it all leads to xenophobia.",
        "most of the degree holders r not even capable of reading. lol dont bring that degree thing. its not just wages. they r \"pampered\" with clothes n other things by their employers. the \"backward regions\" in gujarat where I happen to hve stayed back then were already pampered hence they didnt care about degrees. they knew they could make big bucks rather than degrees. \n\nnow when i sometimes visit, more people go to proper school. but their parents still continue their daily wage jobs coz they get good money.\n\nalso maharashtras village still doesnt hve electricity like gujarat. go n watch raj thakerays speech of 2007 08 where he literally said I went to mah guj border n v hve no electricity on r side while on the other side its lit.\n\njust a year ago, there was a village in MH which wanted to move to guj. \n\nthe interiors of MH ruled by baramati blunders just keep their sugar mills running while living the region drought affected. the also mingled in jal yukti programme fadnavis had started somehow during his stint before 2019.",

        "abe 🤐 when I already mentioned the native people r already doing the work so y would people hire people from outside? jab market ban hi nahi raha toh log jayenge kyu???? itna simple logic nahi samajhta.....and south gujarat has a lot of middle class from maharashtra working in factories. north mumbai - south gujarat connect....",

        "Lmfao. People vote for genocide in the name of development in gujarat, so don't present voting as an evidence for wellbeing. The rich state's abysmal hdi is sufficient evidence for the actual state of affairs. ",

    "light_cleaned_title": "‘No ecosystem there’: Karnataka minister questions why India’s semiconductor units are in Gujarat, Assam - BusinessToday",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Karnataka IT minister Priyank Kharge said that despite the state contributing 10 per cent of the national electronics manufacturing output, it has not been given a level playing field. He said that the semiconductor manufacturing units are in states that do not have the ecosystem or the skill set, calling it unfair.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Those projects are going the GIFT city way: massive waste on infrastructure no one is interested in followed by holding guns to people heads to move their to kill their businesses. they need massive resources such as water. bangalore and surrounding areas arent viable, if that's the place that usually comes to the mind. Karnataka is not just Bengaluru. And Gujarat is not famous for its water bodies. Gujarat is not exactly the place which comes to mind when you think of water. jumlebazi ki jai ho mitron. Do you want to see the future? Just google what's happening with \"worlds largest office\" and see the future of this. > ‘No ecosystem there’ ??? More like ‘No TRAFFIC JAMS and urban sprawl and flooded streets there’... There is a difference here, they are not building infra like GIFT. Just giving incentives. GIFT was more a real estate grift and finance is no way comparable to manufacturing. Companies will build plants there because they are low end ones and most stuff is automated now. The top end jobs will stay where the talent is(Bangalore/Hyderabad). Some mid level jobs will move. Micron is already hiring for GJ plant so it is far more real than GIFT ever was. What is this clown yapping about?…Karnataka received 9x more fdi inflows than gujarat in fy 2023-2024…Not everything has to go karnataka...Karnataka and maharashtra received about 60% of the total fdi…Its high time govt starts prioritizing other states. Yeah, absolutely no floods in Assam and Gujarat. Please google what happened there during the recent rains. But unless forced who will go around and invest in places with no infrastructure. Like are you going to buy a property in Manipur just because no one is buying there? \"Incentives\" is basically paying the corporations to build there after giving them free land. This is a gruff similar to GIFT. Micron and others make money \"setting up\", declare unfeasibly given lack of supply chain and talent, and we're left holding the bag for empty skeletons that cost us 1000x what they're worth. Rinse and repeat. Because politics. Absolutely valid points. i did not mention that Gujarat is a good or appropriate choice. Dont extend your ignorance and incompetence to perceive your thoughts as mine. Everyone knows why. Bruh, you really think you did something with that 'copy&paste'. > Karnataka IT minister Priyank Kharge said if India has to be transformed into a manufacturing hub or a chip designing hub then it has to happen in Karnataka. \"HAS\" to happen in KA. Lol. People in finance jobs / IT jobs may not move, but people of manufacturing jobs will move. Talent has less bargaining power in manufacturing since jobs are even more hard to come by. >Karnataka is not just Bengaluru. Funny, how that logic never extends to IT tech parks. The same thing can happen anywhere. Now some of the projects will surely die but some will work. It's just a numbers game at that point. The lower end ones have a higher probability of working because there is enough local demand. I know people love hating on Gujarat but they have had success in manufacturing. Gujarat is their dumping yard for every d** measuring contest,even Gujrati don’t want the plat there >The same thing can happen anywhere. Now some of the projects will surely die but some will work. Ffs, projects were originally planned for places like maharashtra which had the necessary resources and talent. Gujarat has neither. name checks out Now explain why people from up and bihar prefer moving to maharashtra, karnataka, tamil nadu, kerala, and heck, even bengal, before moving to gujarat for low wage work. You realize gujarat has the second most factories in india and accounts for 18% of the total industrial output of the country? How is is that a state with no infrastructure account for the most industrial output? Gujarat has far better infrastructure than most other states for industrial production. Ports, roads, water availability and stable electric grid. Err,... Salaries in Kerala for Blue Collar Work are comparable to white collar work. A lot of them get nearly 50K working in construction work per month. They are not required to speak Kannada there lol “No one is interested”…Except gujarat has the second most factories in india and accounts for 18% of the industrial output of the country, more than any other state. I am not gonna agree with that, but why does it HAS TO HAPPEN in Karanataka. Why not anywhere else I tried using what’s written in article. Infra and ecosystem is surrounding semi conductor manufacturing not roads and ports. Gujarat has a lot of industrial output. I’m not denying that. My point is even though Gujarat has a lot of output it’s primarily driven by oil and its by product sources. Like polymers, petroleum, paint etc. But not IT, mechanical industries etc. The reason is because they don’t get enough people or skill there to sustain running that industry. The reason why majority of pharma companies are in Chandigarh belt or auto mobile manufacturing is in Tamil Nadu, Bengal belt and textile manufacturing is in south is because they save up a lot on costs and they get people with that skill so that they don’t waste money on training people or waiting for new grads to start working. They want to demand all high paying tech and semconductor jobs in karntaka and also want to pass stupid policies like the job reservation bill. Then proceed to call \"outsiders\" beggars, leechers and whatnot. Assam? Because why wouldn’t you place your strategic multi billion dollar assets within 30 minute flying time of PLAAF air bases? While it doesn’t HAVE to go to Karnataka all the time, it is equally true that it doesn’t HAVE to go to Gujarat all the time. It is toxic both ways. Because there is an ecosystem in Bangalore. Tho there is one in Pune, Hydrabad and Chennai, and a small one in Kolkata too, see how that has expanded? Er, I posted multiple states. And er, lack of man power in a state happens because of its lack of competitiveness of wages among other things. Gujarat and racist Gujaratis already do that while not being even half as good as Bengaluru. What is your point? They are not allowed to have non veg food in Gujarat. Point is, Karnataka can be better. This argument is same as RW gives - \"pakistan kills hindus.. so why cant we...\" I think it's bogus argument here presented by the minister. 1. Just because Karnataka has been a great manufacturer doesn't mean other states don't need to develop. Equitable development can occur along with training of people in other states as well. 2. In India skillet moves with good opportunities. Just see how much Bangaloreans complain about Non Kannadigas. People can be trained and employment can be generated. 3. Companies mostly choose where they want to setup such industries because of the incentives they get. Did Karnataka govt. fail to provide competitive incentives? 4. I do like that North Eastern state is getting good projects that will lead to employment in the region. Stop punching down. > maharashtra which had the necessary resources and talent MH might have marginally more talent but resource wise it is similar. If you want to do allocation based on past performance in electronics manufacturing then TN and UP should be the top contenders. Now tell us what fraction of manufacturing jobs are in gujarat. 18? correct me if I'm wrong, people in gujarat dont refrain from doing blue collar job. I have stayed there n have friends in rural n urban regions. the majdoors there r well taken care of in a lot of fields. be it farming or anything. even wedding ones. while I can surely say, in maharashtra, people here refrain from doing blue collar job n hence outsourcing. like u said, it has become a fashion to hate on gujarat bcoz people not liking modi shah. I have statyed there, the poor there hve been \"pampered\" since modi days. dude's popularity was like anything when i was a kid n didnt know what bjp n modi was. people with glee used to openly say they r gonna vote for modi. v happened to stay in rural area bcoz of posting. another thing is today every oppostion party wants to play some tune during such announcements. maharashtra is gonna get some port n had massive investment announcements few days ago. some project was announced in TN, correct me if I'm wrong. But people who work in semiconductor industry don't know kannada hence decision made to move outside Karnataka doesn't need those evil capitalists scums. Why not? Is he wrong? Calling a spade a spade is not wrong tbh These are going to dholera. Gift doesn't have manufacturing facilities, it's more of a business district Semiconductor manufacture requires lot of water, so why in Karnataka with drinking water issues vs Gujrat with flooding issues? What a braindead logic ! So according to your 'wisdom', states close to enemy countries should not have any industry/development ? Industries should be setup only in South India? And then cry about outsiders coming to your state for jobs? By your logic, should the capital be shifted from New Delhi to South India since New Delhi is only 300 km from china border and it comes under range of their s-400 air defence? Yes because we get regularly bombed by the PLAAF and should just vacate Assam it’s good they are not coming here, already bangalore is highly crowded, they will make the office near airport where lakhs of employees will commute without public infra and lead to traffic jams. yup and then say us to go outside karnataka to other states if we cannot speed kannada and call us names. These infighting will ensure that India will never have a decent semiconductor industry. Companies have an upper hand as they will go to places where they get the most support and benefits from govts. Dont bring chip manufacturing to a state coz of political reason , rather coz of education, human resources availability of other supporting industry. Dont make those in to least human resourceful states. would you ask the semiconductor units in KA also to write all specifications, manuals and all correspondence in kannada only ? if not then you are a hypocrite. lol Just because the ecosystem is not there right now doesn't mean they shouldn't try to make a new one on their own. People who are questioning his way of putting, \"has\" to happen in karnataka is not wrong. When you are building something new, you need to setup shop where the talent and resources are within reach. Who the fuck wants to go to live in Gujarat? Are you kidding me? There is no culture of night clubs, comedy shows, beer, good quality restaurantents which will serve anything and everything (they will fucking kill you if you serve beef there) etc. Tech jobs command high salary and that in itself creates an ecosystem of things you can enjoy with that money. Ask anyone in bangalore if they'd accept a job in gujarat. They won't. It's natural for locals expect other to speak in their language. But in India your employer expects so much from you. After 70 hours of work per weak you literally have no energy for anything productive. After a certain age it's really difficult to learn a new language too. But it's not even about that. And it's not something new. When quora used to be at it's peak, like a decade ago even then I remember reading such things about \"northies\". true, already in mncs we have to work so much, everyone knows about EY suicide, apart from this learn some other language. You know Karnataka is not only benguluru right ? The news you are seeing about water issues is probably from the Bengaluru surroundings. There is places in Karnataka which have more than enough water. In Karnataka, it will be semi-kanaddactur. Very good question. Diamonds and extremism doesnt create semiconductor units. If that is case why not Kerala? Correct. There were multiple contenders based on different cree m criteria. Yet, the goverment forced the project to move from maharashtra to gujarat. >I have statyed there, the poor there hve been \"pampered\" since modi days. dude's popularity was like anything when i was a kid n didnt know what bjp n modi was. people with glee used to openly say they r gonna vote for modi. v happened to stay in rural area bcoz of posting. I have stayed in urban gujarat. There was no pampering of the poor. Poor, middle class, and the rich alike were fed hatred and false pride. Garvi gujarat's pride was showing Muslims their place and claiming to be developed while the hdi languished amongst bimaru states. If you asked those proudly proclaiming greatness of gujarat to talk about how their lives had been improved, they couldn't come up with a single important thing, and ended up with \"but landias have been shown their place!\" >any1 who wants to develop n setup company in their states, they can do it. until n unless they dont \"actually \" want to. This is a bullshit claim, and you know plenty of examples of corporations being forced to move to gujarat after announcing plans to set up in other states. Work on your reading comprehension. No one said the manufacturing units were going to be set up in the ghost town. Yes chips speak in kannad, so it has to happen there. So that kannads can keep attacking more migrants, they need to do something in life. Gujarat better than kannadistan, these clowns attack outsiders everyday, at least Gujjus are not attacking outsiders everyday. Yes and then they will force companies to hire kannad goons, who will then harass everyone inside the company. I agree, but Bangalore has too much trouble with non kannadigas. So better to build somewhere else >correct me if I'm wrong, people in gujarat dont refrain from doing blue collar job. I have stayed there n have friends in rural n urban regions. That is true everywhere for people without degrees and ancestral wealth. They don't have an option to refrain from doing blue collar jobs. >the majdoors there r well taken care of in a lot of fields. This is bullshit. Minimum wages is maharashtra are 1.5 times those in gujarat, and daily wage laborers are paid far less in gujarat the maharashtra. >while I can surely say, in maharashtra, people here refrain from doing blue collar job n hence outsourcing. Higher proportion of population in maharashtra has college degrees, and avoid blue collar work, but that is still a small fraction of the population. In general, the reason why there are plenty of immigrants is because the wages are higher than exploitative wages in gujarat. Semiconductor kya, India will demolish existing industries simply because of this internal bickering that these guys do. And public as we know of this country are puppets of the ministerial puppeteers. Labor issues man, saying this as a Keralite. Also we don't have much space in acres or hectares for manufacturing plants. They should not have any vital industries that are of strategic importance. You do realise that Gujaratis are extremely discriminatory when it comes to real estate and housing? They don’t just do this in Gujarat, they take over neighbourhoods and force locals out. This happens in Mumbai, London and Toronto, why wouldn’t it happen in this dystopian city? Where are “outsiders supposed to live? Why not Andra? U act like as if tho it's upto panwaalas to decide. The question he is raising is why the central government acts in favour of a certain state. If so why should one remain this union? Priyank Kharge’s statement about Gujarat and Assam lacking the ecosystem for semiconductor manufacturing is another divisive comment from a minister who often stirs hostility. His bias against non-Kannada speakers living in Karnataka has previously sparked tensions, and his current rhetoric aims to create regional divides. While he claims that Karnataka deserves semiconductor units, this ignores the national interest and reduces the argument to political favoritism. Kharge’s approach undermines unity and risks Karnataka’s reputation as a cooperative state. I’m from Karnataka, and we deserve better representation. I don't have a problem with him questioning, but i do have a problem with him saying it has to be in Karnataka And no such place, with sufficient water supply, exists elsewhere in the country, correct? People who don't speak Kannada need jobs too sir I have been to Gujarat. they love hindi and have no hate towards oursiders. Idk bro. gujarat auto walas wont thrash me. thats a good thing i want to live with. Mukesh bhai from Jamnagar who have already spent huge money near Pakistan building one of the biggest refinary would like to disagree. This is not *The Kerela Story* the centre wants... >reach. Who the fuck wants to go to live in Gujarat? Anyone who gets paid enough. Karanataka or any other place is not some golden nest. People stay in those places because of their jobs. This is just start. As of now officially Gujarat and Assam has been chosen for it. UP too based on US and India tie up. Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra depending on which company will take the project. From what I read, Adani is doing it in Maharasthra but not sure. Yes they are, but Gujjus are not attacking outsiders on a day to day basis, once again it doesn't happen to all outsiders, for example in Ahmedabad tons of outsiders live in peace, can't say that in case of Bangalore where goons harass for not being kannad. lol you actually justifying housing discrimination. Gujarat has a lot of issues and it all leads to xenophobia. most of the degree holders r not even capable of reading. lol dont bring that degree thing. its not just wages. they r \"pampered\" with clothes n other things by their employers. the \"backward regions\" in gujarat where I happen to hve stayed back then were already pampered hence they didnt care about degrees. they knew they could make big bucks rather than degrees. now when i sometimes visit, more people go to proper school. but their parents still continue their daily wage jobs coz they get good money. also maharashtras village still doesnt hve electricity like gujarat. go n watch raj thakerays speech of 2007 08 where he literally said I went to mah guj border n v hve no electricity on r side while on the other side its lit. just a year ago, there was a village in MH which wanted to move to guj. the interiors of MH ruled by baramati blunders just keep their sugar mills running while living the region drought affected. the also mingled in jal yukti programme fadnavis had started somehow during his stint before 2019. > its not just wages. they r \"pampered\" with clothes n other things by their employers. Lmfao. We're supposed to believe this bullshit, when the evidence shows people not wanting to move to gujarat for such jobs, and gujarat pays far less. abe 🤐 when I already mentioned the native people r already doing the work so y would people hire people from outside? jab market ban hi nahi raha toh log jayenge kyu???? itna simple logic nahi samajhta.....and south gujarat has a lot of middle class from maharashtra working in factories. north mumbai - south gujarat connect.... Whatever lies help you sleep while exploiting the poor... lol. the poor has been voting most in guj. I don't need to sleep unlike u I hve on ground connect. of the poor would hve been \"exploited\" bjp wouldn't b in power for so long there. Lmfao. People vote for genocide in the name of development in gujarat, so don't present voting as an evidence for wellbeing. The rich state's abysmal hdi is sufficient evidence for the actual state of affairs. damn i I forgot I was on india sub😅but its my innate thing to not presume n give a chance to sensible discussion. I think that limit has crossed. i cannot further bang my wall against the wall. yes the state votes for riot there4 after godhra train burning the only time riot like situation has started was by vishesh samuday during anti caa bs or pelting stone on various hindu processions.... >i cannot further bang my wall against the wall. I think your wall stopped working a while ago. >riot A genocide is not a riot."
