Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\n\n## Why is transparency important?\n\nThe Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\n\nThe Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of January, we have up till now filed 32 RTI requests with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05om47xl7kk61.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acddc15c85f26cb317e1a2b8dbf795512ac9a6aa\n\n**Note**: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month's report may be included in the present report.\n\n## Data Protection and Privacy\n\nOne of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 28 requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\n\nUnder IFF’s [**Project Panoptic**](https://panoptic.in/), we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:\n\n1. [**Puducherry Police**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/134Gb966LLFtwypYD4YIZ_9ASxoLeJRJ9/view?usp=sharing),\n2.

The [**Ministry of Home Affairs**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mYN63R3aeOSx97XNrwo22dst1DdTopEx/view?usp=sharing) on the reported internet shutdowns which took place in New Delhi on January 26, 2021.\n2.

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "## tl;dr Since our last report in the month of [**January**](https://internetfreedom.in/digital-transparency-a-right-to-information-report-for-january-2021/), IFF has filed 41 RTI requests. Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights. ## Why is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities. The Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of January, we have up till now filed 32 RTI requests with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government. **Note**: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month's report may be included in the present report. ## Data Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 28 requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens. Under IFF’s [**Project Panoptic**](https://panoptic.in/), we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with: 1. [**Puducherry Police**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/134Gb966LLFtwypYD4YIZ_9ASxoLeJRJ9/view?usp=sharing), 2.

For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns. In the last month, we have filed 13 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with: 1. The [**Ministry of Home Affairs**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mYN63R3aeOSx97XNrwo22dst1DdTopEx/view?usp=sharing) on the reported internet shutdowns which took place in New Delhi on January 26, 2021. 2.
