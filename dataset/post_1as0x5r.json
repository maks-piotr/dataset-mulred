He is with them in sun\nand in shower, and his garment is covered with dust. Put of thy\nholy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!\n\nDeliverance? Where is this deliverance to be found? Our\nmaster himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of\ncreation; he is bound with us all for ever.\n\nCome out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers\nand incense!
