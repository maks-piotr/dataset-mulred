    "selftext": "I wanted to buy a comforter and wakefit had some good options. Since I didn't want to do the whole login thing on Wakefit's website, I ended up buying one of their comforter on Amazon. I decided to checkout some pillows and saw they're running a discount so I ended up logging in to their website and adding the same product in the cart (which I purchased on Amazon) to see if there's any price difference. Imagine to my surprise when the Amazon one still costs cheaper even after you add the discount coupon on their website. Apparently the discount coupon is worth 1,130 and 800 is waived off as \"shipping and Handling fee\"\n\nIs someone going to bring it to my address by walking all the way? ðŸ˜­\n\nAin't this deceiving customers?
