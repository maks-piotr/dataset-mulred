In reply to my \"What?\" email he replied with four paragraph essay of his.\n\nI am waiting to get a reply from the scammer to the latest mail I sent him further investigating how to get the 4.9 million pounds that he is promising me he will share with me once I am established as the next of kin for Late Mrs. Laura S. Greg.\n\nPlease let me know whether any of you got such mail or encountered such scams from the official email ids. And whom should I notify or complaint to about this. \n\nP.S.: I've sent a mail to the Complaints/ Grievance Cell of the Commercial Taxes Department, Tamil Nadu and waiting for their reply.
