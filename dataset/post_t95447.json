Powerful voice.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTv3Zfy2C8I  \n- The Last Goodbye by ODESZA. Clubbers might like this.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpuUOl6ddVI&amp;t=18s",
        "Can someone recommend me the best of Mac Miller? I've only recently started listening to him.",
        "Okay, this is my time to shine. His early stuff is when he was a bit immature (for lack of a better word) and rapping about partying and high school shenanigans, for that listen to kids and Best Day Ever. Nikes On My Feet is still a constant jam for me and an all time classic imo. \n\nWatching Movies w the sound off and Faces was at a time when his substance use (abuse) was really taking its toll and you can hear that lyrically and in the music in those albums. Check out the star room, I'm not real, REMember, avian, diablo, here we go, wedding, happy birthday, from these two. \n\nI think swimming is his best album but that's prolly cos it's the first one i heard. And the entire album is really good, no skips. Jet Fuel is probably my fav mac miller song of all time. \n\nHave fun man",
