        "2 calls everyday from these scammers",
        "Gotten so used to them now if they don't call I think I'm poor or dead.",
        "Indian Fintch is a great growth story, till one looks beneath the surface - it is all about predatory lending and high rates of interest!",
        "I would like to personally punch the person in the face who decided to do that.",
        "Didn't their CEO threaten just a few months back that if people hate their cold calls so much they'll stop but then don't go back to them ever for a loan?\n\nGuess he was just full of hot air",
        "Man I recently booked a doctor's appointment on Practo and instantly received a summary of the appointment on WhatsApp through Bajaj Finserv! It's crazy how even the health data is not secure anymore",
        "I received so many calls from them but after some dodging & threatening they have stopped calling. Still receive messages though.",
        "My Blocklist is filled with Bajaj finance spam calls. But they find new numbers everyday",
        "Share their ceo phone number and let them scam him.\n\nhttps://www.aboutbajajfinserv.com/finance-investor-relations-shareholders-information-listing-on-stock-exchange",
        "I got a message from Bajaj Finance, \"Your loan application has been approved...\"\n\nI never applied for it. Naturally, I panicked, thinking someone else used my details/id for a loan application. I contacted their customer care. I was told that the loan was pre-approved in case I wanted it and that I had misunderstood the text. I insisted there was no application and the text was misguiding. I felt like suing them for causing me stress and anxiety.",
        "He's famous, owner of Bajaj finance",
        "These great stories are just that. Next they will celebrate rise of diabetes and heart attacks as great growth story for healthcare spending",
        "Haha brilliant idea",
        "Am I the only lucky one who never got a call from them? Luckily all the SMSs they sent go into my spam folder, so I nevet even get their notifications.",
        "Regular calls from past 3-4 days, and messages to so many of them.",
        "Receive these calls and put it in front of the TV.",
        "I get these calls in waves. There will be no calls for a couple of days and then non-stop calls for the next few days.\n\n\nIs there something we as consumers can do about this? I've paid off the loan I took from them over 4.5 years back and still being bombarded with calls. Anywhere we can complain? Or anything we can do to reduce the calls, if not stop them?",
        "Those approved ones are spam messages, they send you a link with which takes you to the loan application",
        "In which case I'd like to take him down into a basement, tie his hands behind his back, and make him listen to those bloody pesky calls all day long. And all night. And so on.",
        "That is a whopping revenue for telecom companies. Why do they still feel in cringy and stingy to pay the license fees and statutory demands to the government?",
        "Aren't you being cruel for/on your phone though? My block-list is always empty. However all such pesky calls are handled by handing them over to DoT India (TRAI) DND  app every night before retiring to the bed. That has become a sleep-time ritual for some time now.",
        "I pick these calls up and mute the phone. They keep chanting 'Hello Hello' from 30 seconds (minimum) to some callers who persist till 1 minute 25 seconds and then hung up.\n\nMy intent is to generate as much revenue for the telecom companies using the telemarketing organizations so that they tide over their fiscal deficits.",
        "Once I got a call from Bajaj Finance and then the call was in progress another spam call from CpGrams Feedback Solicitation came in. Just opted to merge them in as a conference call and I went muted to just sit back and watch an Audio Tom and Jerry show between the unsolicited callers.",
        "They always bypass dnd. So blocking is better.",
        "Thank God I didn't choose practo for hospital information management system",
        "Actually they don't bypass. They trespass to violate both the laws of land and individual privacy. \n\nThey have a high number of disposable numbers. So when something gets blocked just throw the SIM and put another with them. So effectively by making them talk to themselves as much as possible (pick up the call and mute yourself) to themselves without getting a reply then after a max of 75 seconds they will hang up themselves. Then you can report the same to close **that** number.\n\nThe only caveat is that more number of plastic SIM cards might get used up as degenerative trend of eco-friendliness.",
        "There is a TRAI Dnd app. Report the spam number on their app.",
        "I receive spam emails from them. Very annoying!",
        "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=trai.gov.in.dnd\n\nFor Android download this app.\n\nFollow below instructions.\n\n1) register your number which you want to stop all the marketing and advertising calls\n2) Enable full DND (you will get transaction sms no problem)\n3) when ever you get a call from bank say Bajaj finance or a robo call then go to app and select the number then select the appropriate option and report it. It's bit manual but worth it.\n4) Don't expect everything will be good in few days or months. It took me a year to get rid of this.\n\n5) No when I get any call I say them that my number is full DND registered and will complaint against your number now, your services will be stopped.\n\nIt's bit time consuming but not I'm having peaceful life.",
        "Predatory lending is something most of us don't realise, unless it's too late.",
        "This reminds me, are you okay?",
        "This!",
        "They kept calling that a 5 lakh loan was approved on my name and can avail it at 12%/annum interest for 5 year term. When i visited their office, the mfer told me that Iâ€™m only eligible for 2.2 lakhs and at 38% interest per year and was forcing me to take that deal. This company and its employees are f**king predators.",
        "They should do the same for Byjus too",
        "Last month I got a few emails regarding a pre-approved loan from a company named Zype and another named Fibe.  \n\nThe email stated that I was the one who requested a loan and a certain amount is pre-approved which I can use instantly by downloading their app.\n\n\nAlso got an email regarding my credit score being pulled up...the email I'd was alerts@crifhighmark.com. \n\nI called up one of the companies Customer care to check if my details were being misused but got a response that it's a mass email sent out by their company.  \n\nCan I report them to any govt authority for pulling out my credit score without my consent?",
        "Wait till ABHA ID becomes mandatory.",
        "How's Jio not on that list?",
        "I think ABDM is a good initiative but the security aspect of it is what's most concerning to even imagine. Security aspect of it aside, it has so much uses",
        "Good luck trying to get any insurance plan once its implemented. Everyone would require you to give your lifetime medical history and they'll make you pay premiums.",
        "Nothing happens",
        "Do they do predatory lending?",
        "Bane of capitalism. They screw up healthcare and education. Two core industries that are essential and core to human development. US is a live example of this. Everyone thinks US has a great healthcare but it only works for the rich. We all know about US education, they import doctors and engineers."
