    "selftext": "So the layout of my house is quite like this‚Äî its a two story building with a ground and first floor. There are 3 families living here, 1(My grandpa, mum dad and me), 2(Mama, Mami and my cousin sister) 3(Naani, my mother‚Äôs sister and her son). It used to be 3 separate families but they married each other. We own 3 rooms, a kitchen downstairs and a room small enough to just fit a single bed where grandpa sleeps and the main room where rest of us sleep. Mama Mami have 4 rooms upstairs and only Naani Bhai and aunty live downstairs. \n\nIt was 11.30 and we were all in bed by this time when someone started banging wildly on my aunt‚Äôs window screaming that there was a fire. It was our neighbour who had moved in just a couple months ago. My aunt and bhai went out to see our main door up in flames. They put out the fire with water and decided to tell us in the morning. Now the thing is, its clear that it was started deliberately. There‚Äôs used matchsticks lined right outside our door. The point of concern is also that our meter box was right by the gate. 10 minutes more of that fire and it would have been a disaster. We don‚Äôt have any proof but we‚Äôre pretty sure it was the next door neighbours. Our other neighbours came to see it and they were also of the same opinion. ‚ÄúWho else can do it except the ones that roam out at night?‚Äù Aka our next door neighbours who are also avid alcoholics might I add. We‚Äôve had small feuds with them for a long time but the most recent one(end of june) was the worst and they‚Äôre envious of anyone‚Äôs success. Our house was very delapidated(its over a 100 years old) and my mama has a successful job so he put in like 4-5 lakhs to renovate it. We didn‚Äôt even have a main door before this. This obviously lit a fire under their arse and they‚Äôd pick fights over anything and everything. They‚Äôre also unemployed and their daughter works a small job but mostly stays out of home(she doesn‚Äôt like her parents either)\n\nI‚Äôm sorry this was long but what should we do next? Is there any legal action that can be taken against them? I like picked up a match from the front of our house with tongs and kept it in wrapping paper(did I watch too many crime shows?) IS there something that can be done? \n\nP.s. before you guys accuse me of karka fishing, I‚Äôm going to attach photos.",
