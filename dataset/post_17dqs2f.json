    "selftext": "There's a loophole in Amazon that delivery agents are exploiting. They can cancel your order just by your Name, Delivery address, and Order ID **using a completely different Amazon account.**  \n\nLast week, the delivery agent refused to deliver at the doorstep and asked me to come 3 km from the delivery location. He stopped attending my calls, so I reached out to Customer Care; they said we'd reschedule the delivery for tomorrow, but in the evening, I received a message that my package was canceled. I contacted CS, and they asked me to place another order. Fine, not that important package.  However, my two other packages were similarly canceled when I contacted CS. They said, \"I asked them to cancel, and we have a chat history.\" so I requested to speak to customer care, and he also said he could see my cancellation request on his end. \n\nI obviously didn't cancel the orders.  I checked the history on my end and couldn't find any conversation with Sagnik.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipzisk3diqvb1.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f37959ac734dbf2b0c2b32dde0729f539144db1\n\nI asked him to check if the old package was canceled similarly, and he confirmed.  \n\n**Now**, **how are they doing this?**  \nCustomer care only asked for the Name, Address, and Order ID; all of this information is already mentioned on the package, so it's easy for them to impersonate you.\n\nTo prove this, I asked my friend to cancel my order from his account. I can't upload a video with audio on Reddit; [here's the call recording](https://twitter.com/abhagsain/status/1716039930382569544)  \n\nAfter raising this complaint, I thought it would solve the problem. But not this easily.  \nOne package was supposed to be delivered yesterday, and I received a call last night (8:29 PM). The person said, \"Sir, we'll deliver your order tomorrow,\" **but they marked it as \"attempted\" to show it in the logs that they called the customer.** The package isn't even out for delivery today, and I haven't received any calls so far.\n\nThis is another loophole; they will do this two more times, and the packages will get canceled automatically. I have contacted customer care several times, and they always say we'll take action, but nothing happens.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k05duvuviqvb1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba7c3ba1b8fc011f059410d84b1acfd4b619112\n\nI have ordered a gift for my dad's birthday, and it's supposed to be delivered tomorrow. But these delivery agents will keep me in a loop, and the package won't get delivered on time.  \nEither Amazon doesn't take action, or these delivery partners don't fear anyone. \n\nWhat should I do? I have already tweeted about it, hoping to get a resolution, but do you think it will help?  \nI'm so frustrated that I'm ready to pay people to amplify this and hopefully Amazon will take any action.",

        "Recently happened with one of my order, the delivery time was 10pm at night, the agent calls me around 9:30 and tells me that he is in some problems so he will deliver the package the next day which i agreed to.\n\nWhen i got up the next day i checked the status and it said the order has been cancelled. I called the customer care and there were no disagreements on who cancelled the order.",
        "Customer Rep on Twitter connected me to a Social Media team and they person said we operate differently and our requests are prioritised.\n\nHe asked me to wait for 3 business days and if this isn't resolved. I can connect with him again. \nThe biggest issue is everytime you call it's a new customer representative and you have to tell the whole backstory and most of the time they don't believe you or let you finish. \n\nThanks for the info man. I'll do this if it's not resolved this way.",
        "Same happened to me like a week back. Had ordered goods worth 35K. The driver calls me for location. Multiple follow up later I get a message that \"I have rejected the package on doorsteps.\" and order has been cancelled.\n\nFortunately Amazon refunded the amount asap and help me pay for whatever difference was there between what I ordered and what was currently selling.\n\nBut still lost 3-4 days. :(",
        "And OP Amazon wont be able to do anything. Once cancelled the system cancels the order. Amazon associate might say that they will re-arrange the delivery, but nothing happens. In my case this matter went on for 3days before I escalated it to Specialist Team. Turnout once cancelled the order can not be re-delivered.\n\nGey on call with them, explain it to the Technician Team. Ask them to fast track your refund. Inmy case they did with 24 hours. Re-order. If any price difference they will compensate you.",
        "How did you prove that it was delivery person?\nI had to do multiple calls, chats and a live demo to prove it was the delivery agent.\n\nEventually a customer rep understood after 40 minutes of ELI5.\n[Here's the call recording ](https://twitter.com/abhagsain/status/1716039930382569544?t=jWJnrs0mws_TRJWIN_STUw&s=19)",

        "That's the thing, i didn't have to prove anything. I just told the whole incident and the customer rep accepted it. She even confirmed that they are facing such issues with the agents nowadays. We even discussed why the agent would have done that since it was Ganesh visarjan and it also rained heavily that evening in my city so he would not been able to cover the deliveries. \nI also told her that i personally don't like these same day 10pm deliveries as it already feels dicy and they should change the process.",
        "Yeah, I understand a canceled order can't be rescheduled.  \nI waited a week for the PS5 to get delivered, it was my first console, so I was very excited, but the delivery agent canceled at the end moment. I bought it offline the next day.\n\nYeah, you get a refund, but it's not really about the refund. It's about the time and energy you waste on these trivial things, and today customer care told me you can get a coupon in case of the price difference in these cases. But nobody wants these issues in the first place.",
        "The same happened to me during covid. I ordered monthly ration since everything was locked down. When the order dint arrive I called Customer Support and they said they \"simply cancelled the order\". I was furious! They cancelled ration during the time of lock down and dint even bother to notify me.\nNever ordered anything from amazon since then.",
        "If you have enough evidence you should sue them. I couldn't because I dint have any.\nMove to consumer court and they will get penalized.",
        "That sucks. Did the customer care cancel the order of the delivery person?\n\nIn my case, when the first order got cancelled they didn't mention that it was cancelled from my end. They just asked me to place it again but thankfully a customer rep got frustrated and started spilling everything that's when I understood the whole scam.",
        "It's a lot of luck man. Sometimes you get Customer Rep that understand the whole thing easily but if you're stuck with someone who doesn't listen or let you complete it's draining.",
        "That's true, also in such cases I would email them once again in detail so that it stays in written form too.",
        "I don't know, it would consume a lot of time. Someone please take the financial help from me, file the case and we'll split the penalty amount. If it's even more than what we spend.\n\nMost of the working people including myself will avoid Court Kachehari k Chakkar. They have connected me with a social media team and hopefully it will fix the issue.",
        "Yep it was the delivery agent. Showed the same. As if I was contacted and they couldn't reach and cancelled. I did not get any calls from delivery agent.\n\nThe customer support said first that the agent did it then switched it to they did it when I requested to talk to higher up. I was more worried about getting the supplies so I din't take anytime to store evidence. Just told them won't be using amazon anymore and nor will my whole family. They were like \"Okay\" and cut the call.  \nIdk why this seems like a big scam or something run by the employees or maybe I'm thinking too much.",
        "You can file it online as far as I know. And consumer court will take less time to solve this compared to other crimes. Maybe perhaps find a lawyer who can advise you on what to do? Like a friend who knows a lawyer or a family member who knows a lawyer?",
        "Strange, I think during Covid days they were getting a lot of requests, so they didn't bother too much. Curious, since you don't use Amazon anymore, do you use Flipkart now?\n\nI have heard/read Flipkart customer service is even worse than Amazon :/",

        "Last year, something similar happened. I had ordered my sibling's textbooks for school, which had reached the final delivery station already, and were supposed to be delivered the next day. \n\nI had contacted them via Chat for an issue with another order, but the agent didn't help me out with that. So, right after the chat finished, I answered \"No\" in the feedback form where they ask whether the customer service representative was helpful or not. \n\nWithin minutes, I noticed that all the pending orders were cancelled, including the one for which I contacted them! There were 4 orders in total, 3 of which were my siblings' textbooks, among which 2 were due for delivery the next day! \n\nWhen I escalated the issue to their Executive-Customer Relations (ECR) Team, I learnt that the orders was cancelled by the same agent whom I had contacted via Chat. \n\nI also learnt that the customer service representative can immediately see which customer rated them \"Yes\" or \"No\", but the further feedback which is asked in terms of stars (Out of 5) are visible only to their supervisors. \n\nSo, essentially, the agent furiously cancelled my orders perhaps because he was angry I rated him negatively. I was angry more so because the textbooks were not available locally, and even on Amazon, all of them were out of stock. \n\nSo, yeah, Amazon's cancellation policy sucks. \n\nNow, about your issue — I'm pretty sure that their delivery person can cancel the order without even contacting the customer care or impersonating you (which is a tedious process BTW) by simply marking that the customer refused pickup. However, *they need to be present at your geolocation to do so.*\n\nIf they are asking you to come 3km away, it's likely that Amazon's systems have wrong geolocation of your address. To correct it, do the following:\n\nOpen Amazon app > from the bottom, tap on \"You\" > Your Account > Your Addresses. \n\nThen in the desired address, tap on \"Update Delivery Location\" and pin your correct delivery location from the map.",

        "I don't have earphones right now. I have worked as amazon delivery guy few years ago. We couldn't cancel order unless we are few meters away from delivery destination. Else need cancel OTP.\n\n\nWhen customer enters delivery location, there is 100-200 meter circle formed around your delivery location. Unless agent is within circle, he can't cancel order himself because it means he didn't even attempt to delivery.",
        "I understand the late delivery and I also don't want them to risk their life at late night because weather is also cold here in Himachal. But this isn't the first time happening with me. It's been going on for over a week now, first they were doing the cancellation trick and when it stopped working they are now trying the \"attempt delivery\" loophole.\n\nI received these two OTPs yesterday and it's most likely the delivery person again tried to cancel the orders from his other account but couldn't as I have now setup 2FA after the first 3 order got cancelled.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mpjqxch7rvb1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f440525a6091fefe4c25ec1c7f201730048be0d",

Location doens't matter.\n\nThis way he didn't have to deliver the parcel at doorsteps and wouldn't face any penalty because it's the customer who cancelled the order not him.\n\nAnd the customer rep told me if the delivery person cancels the order it shows as \"rejected\" and if the customer cancels it, it shows as \"cancelled\".",

Given that they had so much information i believed it to be genuine.\n\nThen the Bluetooth speaker was automatically marked as \"Packaging arrived empty\" and a refund was initiated.\n\nNow, because I do COD orders only, I don't have a bank account for refunds on my Amazon.\n\nBut once I caught on, I checked my account and there was an SBI account on my profile that I had no idea about. And the best part is that the name on the account was mine.\n\nI spoke to Amazon about it and told them there must be a breach in their security, they didn't do anything but put restrictions on my account.\n\nAmazon India is full of scam artists inside and out.

    "light_cleaned_title": "Amazon delivery agents can cancel your orders on your behalf. And you'll never know.",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "There's a loophole in Amazon that delivery agents are exploiting. They can cancel your order just by your Name, Delivery address, and Order ID **using a completely different Amazon account.** Last week, the delivery agent refused to deliver at the doorstep and asked me to come 3 km from the delivery location. He stopped attending my calls, so I reached out to Customer Care; they said we'd reschedule the delivery for tomorrow, but in the evening, I received a message that my package was canceled. I contacted CS, and they asked me to place another order. Fine, not that important package. However, my two other packages were similarly canceled when I contacted CS. They said, \"I asked them to cancel, and we have a chat history.\" so I requested to speak to customer care, and he also said he could see my cancellation request on his end. I obviously didn't cancel the orders. I checked the history on my end and couldn't find any conversation with Sagnik. &#x200B; I asked him to check if the old package was canceled similarly, and he confirmed. **Now**, **how are they doing this?** Customer care only asked for the Name, Address, and Order ID; all of this information is already mentioned on the package, so it's easy for them to impersonate you. To prove this, I asked my friend to cancel my order from his account. I can't upload a video with audio on Reddit; [here's the call recording](https://twitter.com/abhagsain/status/1716039930382569544) After raising this complaint, I thought it would solve the problem. But not this easily. One package was supposed to be delivered yesterday, and I received a call last night (8:29 PM). The person said, \"Sir, we'll deliver your order tomorrow,\" **but they marked it as \"attempted\" to show it in the logs that they called the customer.** The package isn't even out for delivery today, and I haven't received any calls so far. This is another loophole; they will do this two more times, and the packages will get canceled automatically. I have contacted customer care several times, and they always say we'll take action, but nothing happens. I have ordered a gift for my dad's birthday, and it's supposed to be delivered tomorrow. But these delivery agents will keep me in a loop, and the package won't get delivered on time. Either Amazon doesn't take action, or these delivery partners don't fear anyone. What should I do? I have already tweeted about it, hoping to get a resolution, but do you think it will help? I'm so frustrated that I'm ready to pay people to amplify this and hopefully Amazon will take any action.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I'm ready to invest ₹10k-₹15k in this issue. Please let me know if I can pay someone to amplify this. Youtuber, Journalist, Twitter celebrity, anyone that can spread the word. Send all these details including screenshots, order IDs etc to jeff(at)amazon(dot)com, you will get email back from their ECR team and the delivery people who were doing these will be penalised. I don't know man, is that a sarcasm or are you serious? Is that a sarcasm or are you serious? Sorry, I honestly can't tell the difference. Recently happened with one of my order, the delivery time was 10pm at night, the agent calls me around 9:30 and tells me that he is in some problems so he will deliver the package the next day which i agreed to. When i got up the next day i checked the status and it said the order has been cancelled. I called the customer care and there were no disagreements on who cancelled the order. Customer Rep on Twitter connected me to a Social Media team and they person said we operate differently and our requests are prioritised. He asked me to wait for 3 business days and if this isn't resolved. I can connect with him again. The biggest issue is everytime you call it's a new customer representative and you have to tell the whole backstory and most of the time they don't believe you or let you finish. Thanks for the info man. I'll do this if it's not resolved this way. Same happened to me like a week back. Had ordered goods worth 35K. The driver calls me for location. Multiple follow up later I get a message that \"I have rejected the package on doorsteps.\" and order has been cancelled. Fortunately Amazon refunded the amount asap and help me pay for whatever difference was there between what I ordered and what was currently selling. But still lost 3-4 days. :( And OP Amazon wont be able to do anything. Once cancelled the system cancels the order. Amazon associate might say that they will re-arrange the delivery, but nothing happens. In my case this matter went on for 3days before I escalated it to Specialist Team. Turnout once cancelled the order can not be re-delivered. Gey on call with them, explain it to the Technician Team. Ask them to fast track your refund. Inmy case they did with 24 hours. Re-order. If any price difference they will compensate you. How did you prove that it was delivery person? I had to do multiple calls, chats and a live demo to prove it was the delivery agent. Eventually a customer rep understood after 40 minutes of ELI5. [Here's the call recording ](https://twitter.com/abhagsain/status/1716039930382569544?t=jWJnrs0mws_TRJWIN_STUw&s=19) It isn't sarcasm.. it used to work when Jeff was still CEO...I have made several complaints to that and got priority resolution.. but after Jeff left his office it's different it's like regular customer care \" with sorry for experience , can't help anymore but ensure it will not happen again kinda response\" but you can still give it a try if something changed again! That's the thing, i didn't have to prove anything. I just told the whole incident and the customer rep accepted it. She even confirmed that they are facing such issues with the agents nowadays. We even discussed why the agent would have done that since it was Ganesh visarjan and it also rained heavily that evening in my city so he would not been able to cover the deliveries. I also told her that i personally don't like these same day 10pm deliveries as it already feels dicy and they should change the process. Yeah, I understand a canceled order can't be rescheduled. I waited a week for the PS5 to get delivered, it was my first console, so I was very excited, but the delivery agent canceled at the end moment. I bought it offline the next day. Yeah, you get a refund, but it's not really about the refund. It's about the time and energy you waste on these trivial things, and today customer care told me you can get a coupon in case of the price difference in these cases. But nobody wants these issues in the first place. The same happened to me during covid. I ordered monthly ration since everything was locked down. When the order dint arrive I called Customer Support and they said they \"simply cancelled the order\". I was furious! They cancelled ration during the time of lock down and dint even bother to notify me. Never ordered anything from amazon since then. If you have enough evidence you should sue them. I couldn't because I dint have any. Move to consumer court and they will get penalized. That sucks. Did the customer care cancel the order of the delivery person? In my case, when the first order got cancelled they didn't mention that it was cancelled from my end. They just asked me to place it again but thankfully a customer rep got frustrated and started spilling everything that's when I understood the whole scam. It's a lot of luck man. Sometimes you get Customer Rep that understand the whole thing easily but if you're stuck with someone who doesn't listen or let you complete it's draining. That's true, also in such cases I would email them once again in detail so that it stays in written form too. I don't know, it would consume a lot of time. Someone please take the financial help from me, file the case and we'll split the penalty amount. If it's even more than what we spend. Most of the working people including myself will avoid Court Kachehari k Chakkar. They have connected me with a social media team and hopefully it will fix the issue. Yep it was the delivery agent. Showed the same. As if I was contacted and they couldn't reach and cancelled. I did not get any calls from delivery agent. The customer support said first that the agent did it then switched it to they did it when I requested to talk to higher up. I was more worried about getting the supplies so I din't take anytime to store evidence. Just told them won't be using amazon anymore and nor will my whole family. They were like \"Okay\" and cut the call. Idk why this seems like a big scam or something run by the employees or maybe I'm thinking too much. You can file it online as far as I know. And consumer court will take less time to solve this compared to other crimes. Maybe perhaps find a lawyer who can advise you on what to do? Like a friend who knows a lawyer or a family member who knows a lawyer? Strange, I think during Covid days they were getting a lot of requests, so they didn't bother too much. Curious, since you don't use Amazon anymore, do you use Flipkart now? I have heard/read Flipkart customer service is even worse than Amazon :/ I found these 2 links. Maybe these will help? [https://www.myadvo.in/blog/how-to-file-a-case-in-consumer-court](https://www.myadvo.in/blog/how-to-file-a-case-in-consumer-court) [https://ncdrc.nic.in](https://ncdrc.nic.in) First one is to know the procedure. Second one had contact no. to them. Hope this helps! No wonder I avoid online shopping in India unless it's a very low value item. Thank you. I'll check them out Last year, something similar happened. I had ordered my sibling's textbooks for school, which had reached the final delivery station already, and were supposed to be delivered the next day. I had contacted them via Chat for an issue with another order, but the agent didn't help me out with that. So, right after the chat finished, I answered \"No\" in the feedback form where they ask whether the customer service representative was helpful or not. Within minutes, I noticed that all the pending orders were cancelled, including the one for which I contacted them! There were 4 orders in total, 3 of which were my siblings' textbooks, among which 2 were due for delivery the next day! When I escalated the issue to their Executive-Customer Relations (ECR) Team, I learnt that the orders was cancelled by the same agent whom I had contacted via Chat. I also learnt that the customer service representative can immediately see which customer rated them \"Yes\" or \"No\", but the further feedback which is asked in terms of stars (Out of 5) are visible only to their supervisors. So, essentially, the agent furiously cancelled my orders perhaps because he was angry I rated him negatively. I was angry more so because the textbooks were not available locally, and even on Amazon, all of them were out of stock. So, yeah, Amazon's cancellation policy sucks. Now, about your issue — I'm pretty sure that their delivery person can cancel the order without even contacting the customer care or impersonating you (which is a tedious process BTW) by simply marking that the customer refused pickup. However, *they need to be present at your geolocation to do so.* If they are asking you to come 3km away, it's likely that Amazon's systems have wrong geolocation of your address. To correct it, do the following: Open Amazon app > from the bottom, tap on \"You\" > Your Account > Your Addresses. Then in the desired address, tap on \"Update Delivery Location\" and pin your correct delivery location from the map. total BS post. Agents can't cancel order unless they are few meters away from delivery location on map. I have proved it to the customer representative. Please [listen to this recording](https://twitter.com/abhagsain/status/1716039930382569544?t=vexsrFbBWtggxaHke5dJIQ&s=19) I don't have earphones right now. I have worked as amazon delivery guy few years ago. We couldn't cancel order unless we are few meters away from delivery destination. Else need cancel OTP. When customer enters delivery location, there is 100-200 meter circle formed around your delivery location. Unless agent is within circle, he can't cancel order himself because it means he didn't even attempt to delivery. I understand the late delivery and I also don't want them to risk their life at late night because weather is also cold here in Himachal. But this isn't the first time happening with me. It's been going on for over a week now, first they were doing the cancellation trick and when it stopped working they are now trying the \"attempt delivery\" loophole. I received these two OTPs yesterday and it's most likely the delivery person again tried to cancel the orders from his other account but couldn't as I have now setup 2FA after the first 3 order got cancelled. Happened with me twice The OP is telling the truth, it has happened to me several times already on Amazon. Just yesterday my Amazon fresh order got cancelled automatically by the delivery guy, not even a single call to me. Please listen to the recording later. He wasn't cancelling from the delivery location. He was cancelling it by pretending to be me from a completely different Amazon account. Location doens't matter. This way he didn't have to deliver the parcel at doorsteps and wouldn't face any penalty because it's the customer who cancelled the order not him. And the customer rep told me if the delivery person cancels the order it shows as \"rejected\" and if the customer cancels it, it shows as \"cancelled\". > I have worked as amazon delivery guy few years ago. And things never change, ever. Right? Add 2FA to your account. Amazon's quality is going down. I have stopped using Amazon unless absolutely necessary. Add 2FA to your account and you'll get OTP. I think yesterday again the delivery person tried cancelling the order by pretending to be me but I recieved these OTPs. When it didn't work he called me and said I'll deliver your order tomorrow but marked it as a \"delivery attempt\", doesn't matter what he told me on the phone. I guess it would count as an attempt. We only have two options here in Himachal, either Amazon or Flipkart. Flipkart customer service is even worse than Amazon so we chose less worse :/ Waw. They must have changed rules I guess. I will listen to recording later. I will delete my original comments because I am getting downvoted and I don't have enough karma. Are tou by any chance in a remote place where orders are delivered by third party courier services? I have experienced this behaviour with them. They ask me to come to the main road which is about 500m away. And they dont bother to come even if asked. I think if they were Amzn delivery person they would have more authority to take some action. If third party, then I dont know what Amzn can do much. Not like they have plenty of option to switch services The order is showing out for delivery now and I'm 99% sure it will get marked as delivery attempt and will get sent back.... again. It’s already there What did the customer rep say? Since I'm currently working for Amazon on a customer facing retail feature I can assure that the issue is going to be looked upon and your screenshots must've been shared to the concerned tech team already. True. Earlier mail on this id would give you immediate response. Don't they need to authenticate before being able to cancel? Even if they're doing it from another account, they need the email of the original buyer I think. Apparently not. Here's the call recording where I proved it to [Amazon Representative ](https://twitter.com/abhagsain/status/1716039930382569544?t=VVR3nw1KG2KmjL25ZB1ejw&s=19) There is another Amazon scam that happened with me. I don't know how common it is, but the way it happened, I am sure there is an internal breach. I had ordered Bluetooth Speaker from Amazon on COD and it was delivered. After it was delivered I got a call from \"Amazon\" and they knew all the details that only Amazon would know - contents of the package, name, address, phone number, when the package was delivered and that it was COD. The person said that the OTP I gave the the delivery person did not register and there will be another OTP. Given that they had so much information i believed it to be genuine. Then the Bluetooth speaker was automatically marked as \"Packaging arrived empty\" and a refund was initiated. Now, because I do COD orders only, I don't have a bank account for refunds on my Amazon. But once I caught on, I checked my account and there was an SBI account on my profile that I had no idea about. And the best part is that the name on the account was mine. I spoke to Amazon about it and told them there must be a breach in their security, they didn't do anything but put restrictions on my account. Amazon India is full of scam artists inside and out. And they don't recognise their fault and will put restrictions on the customer. There is a lot more to this story but that would be a very long post but leaving this here for visibility. Drop an email to jeff bezos, not a joke they actually have a dedicated team reading his email for customer grievances. The issues are resolved within 48 hours, not sure if you need to drop email to andy now But what are the achieving by cancelling orders? Kam mehnat, don't need to deliver at doorstep, no penalty since the order is getting cancelled from customer's end. Do you think a delivery boy cares if Amazon loses money or a customer faces some issue? Next time travel 3 Kms to collect the package with a baseball bat and couple of your friends. Let’s all find out why he can’t deliver to your location. The more I see posts like this the more I don't want to shop using e commerce stores btw did you had a prime account or non prime account? It's a Prime business account Gussa to bahut aa raha hai but I can't do this. It will make everything my fault even when it's delivery agent's fault. Listen to this guy OP, he knows what he is doing Damn even I have a prime account even though ice never faced these problems I just called the delivery boy and after hearing my name. He started doing \"hello, hello, aawaz nhi aa rhi\" drama. And I haven't done anything to this guy other than just asking him to deliver at doorstep. At least you can find out by being gentle. Don’t be aggressive. Friends and baseball bat for safety sake only. This particular delivery agent is haramkhor. I don't know his name. The order was showing out for delivery and I just called him. After hearing my name he started doing \"hello, hello, hello\" but didn't cut the call for 3 more minutes. I haven't done anything to this guy other than asking him to deliver at doorstep. I'm furious right now. Amazon's ECR team (executive relations) is their highest escalation email. Whatever you email to them won't be available to normal CS and even social media, they can't access emails to ECR. In 2-4 days will get a call from ECR team, usually +44 suffix sometimes could be othe countries...they will discuss it. This is Indian ECR but they have access to various country codes so not always same. If they can't connect, you will receive an email with lines like “Hello [NAME], My name is [NAME] with Amazon's Executive Relations team. We received your email and are following up to ensure your concerns are addressed...“ While normal CS and social escalation, and managers are bound by template replies, ECR has no such limitations, often reply in far more casual tone. This being festive season, could take 4-5 days for initial reply but you will have best resolution from them. I have been using flipkart because of shitty behaviour of amazon. And i can confirm that flipkart has improved a lot. They also provide open packaging of goods which is definitely better. You don’t need to give OTP until and unless you see what you ordered. And i still haven’t faced any issues whatsoever. If you have a known lawyer, file a complaint in consumer court. I ordered a phone from Amazon a few years back, and the payment was deducted twice. Amazon blamed the bank and the bank blamed Amazon. I got so annoyed that I filed a case in consumer court. And what do you know? The amount was very quickly returned. Never had this experience before, but thanks for the heads up. Hope this news won't reach to many delivery agents. This never happened with me but I am really shocked to see delivery agent behaving like this. Delivery agent in my area is very friendly and manytime would wait outside my home for more time if I am occupied or come late. Some people are really evil and would behave wherever they go. We're talking HEFTY fines for this kind of stuff. I understand the feeling. The item i ordered was a CPU processor. This delay basically wasted 3-4 days and the stress was another thing altogether. I had plans to finish my build midweek and spend the Friday and Weekends playing games with my friends. All I was left was Sunday...I probably called their customer support 6-7 times a day taking follow ups! Email amazons ceo and the delivery company. Same happened to me but the delivery agent was also charging 100inr for each delivery extra. Back and forth with xpressbees and it was resolved. In our area, it's some other delivery company that handles Flipkart's orders, and they don't give a shit, they will never deliver at the doorstep :/ I believe when a company starts delivering by itself (eKart in flipkart’s case) they start to take authority. And try their best to give the best. I am sorry for you experience. Start by ordering low value items and try to get the flipkart VIP. It is as good as advertised. I have Flipkart Plus, they have introduced VIP as well? Is it possible that they get to keep the cancelled orders? The delivery guys at my college (which was a little further away from the city) often did it if you couldn’t attend the call due to being in classes and would not reschedule it or pick up your calls and just simply cancel your order because you couldnt pick up the phone once and would always be rude whenever you went to take the order “KABSE PHONE KAR RAHA SAMAJH NAI AATA” very professional Yes. They have recently rolled it out. It gives free delivery, 1-day delivery, dedicated customer support, etc for a year Not related to amazon but flipkart. They have introduced this new thing where you can return the mobile you want to exchanged after 1 week of getting your new mobile delivered so you can easily transfer data to the new phone. Great initiative on paper but not in reality. Since you have to pay the whole amount in advance for the new phone and the exchanged amount will be credited back to your account or fk balance, they simply won't pick up the old phone. I ordered a phone for my mom and it got delivered on 10th Oct, and the old phone was supposed to be pick up by 21. Now it is saying Cancelled on the exchange request. No one showed up to pick up the mobile. Daily I would receive a message saying the phone will be picked up today and at night would receive that we couldn't pick up and will try again tomorrow. I checked cashify and was getting a better price there so I didn't bother calling up their customer care, but for those who actually want to exchange their old phones/laptop, suck for them. And cc the directors Nah. Supply chains dont work that way. A proper log is kept by the manufacturer-distributor Was that a/c in your profile opened in your name? Or was that the scammer's a/c? Bro write a mail to Jeff Bezos. Not joking but they actually take the complaints in that very seriously. Make sure you attach all the proof there itself to add more weight. The higher level customer care team emails you with proper updates and actually cater to you. Good luck! Baseball bat in India? xD So who was at fault? Don't leave us hanging. order it on [amazon](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=baseball+bat&ref=nb_sb_noss) itself. They never gave a concrete answer Just said they will raise to the concerned department and my refund will be refunded in 5-7 business days The matter hasn't been fully resolved. It's still going on in the court. Usually consumer cases don't take a long time, but the issue with this case is that there are 2 parties involved, so determining the fault will take a little time as both companies blame the other. The money was refunded long ago, but I believe once the case is over, whoever the court finds wrong, will have to pay us a small penalty for inconvenience, and hopefully the legal costs are reimbursed as well lol. The delivery agent will cancel that too lmao Just fines for impersonating a person and opening a bank account in their name making them legally answerable for any criminal source of funds or funds otherwise in that account? Wild laws 🤠 why don't you just do what he's asking lol - email jeff The social media customer care asked me to wait for three business days and they will resolve this matter. Let's see. If that doesn't work I'll email Jeff but other person mentioned nowadays you get templated replies from this email as well :/ r/legaladviceindia Court case. You will defiantly win this you got the proof in your hand Aargh! Been there, have lodged a consumer complaint but waiting for a resolution When did you raise it? This happened recently. 12/10 Honestly till now I haven't faced any issues with flipkart. I get free delivery without any subscription. Had issue with products twice and got resolved within 2 days. Customer support takes time to talk properly. Maybe it's a region thing but I've had no issues by far. Upload this incident on Twitter and send the link everywhere to popularise it. Garner as much attention as you can. I myself started using #FuckFlipkart on twitter because of how bad my experience was Free delivery on most products* (since I shop regularly from them) Always record all your calls with customer care and delivery guys. Keep screenshots of everything, from order details before making the payment till after. Amazon cancelled my order and blamed me for the order being cancelled. And asked me to reorder. But the price of the product has changed significantly. And they can't do anything. I called amazon and told them I have recordings of my previous calls to amazon customer care regarding the order, and it was due to their agent's fault the order got cancelled. And when I threatened them to take legal action and share the reording on social media, they offered to pay the price difference (match the price to my original order) when I reorder. Twitter CS will forward the case to standard SDS (shipping & delivery support team) however chances of them doing anything is less. ECR would forward the case to SDS ECR, usually the people who are the heads of your state's delivery support, it would be prioritised. A similar kind of incident happened to me more than 3 times, so i have stopped purchasing from Amazon. This only happens in big cities, in rural areas I have never faced the problem, the package is late but always gets delivered. I prefer buying offline at least I can harass the dukan wala. not this kind of incident but damaged packaging i have received a lot and local station manager is shit and tries to force such products on customers - so i started to pay via cash on delivery. I've complained to amazon team more than 2 dozen times and every time they give assurance and till present they haven't done anything. I even provided specific instructions and still no positive outcome. Their only good service was amazon fresh. So Amazon doesn't let you add a bank account on your Amazon account if the name on the Amazon and bank accounts don't match. Amazon only shows the last two digits of the account number, name on the account (which was my name), and the branch code (which was an SBI branch based in a state which is notorious for scams). I did multiple checks on my PAN card and adhaar to check if there are any unrecognised bank account in my name and fortunately none turned up. So the scammers were in possession of a bank account in a name same as mine in which they were redirecting the refunds. I was able to catch on soon because I got a call from original Amazon customer care regarding the non - delivery of a product and I became suspicious and blocked my Amazon account. I reached to the \"highest\" level of Amazon customer care and they were just rude and dismissive. I filed a police complaint and they asked if i had faced any monetary loss which I hadn't as the money was being refunded by Amazon to the scammers and I had already received my product. So they told me to be careful about OTPs and they closed the application. It used to work. Jeff@amazon. Now that jassy is ceo- use ajassy@amazon and put jeff@amazon in CC. -ex amazon employee If they can open a/c without running checks of PAN and Aadhaar, they will probably try to apply for small loans or low limit credit cards, by submitting other forged documents. This will affect your credit score. Check your CIBIL report to see if any loan or exists in your name that you have never applied for. You should also check for enquiries from banks or NBFCs where you never went in the report. If you find something, then report to SBI. Yes that is a good suggestion. I will get right on it. Thank you very much. >What should I do? Look for alternatives to getting things delivered. > The social media customer care asked me to wait for three business days That corporate process is in place to reduce their headache, not rectify your complaint. Chuck the process, mail Jeff as has been recommended. I once got a corporate issue, that was dragging for 4 months, fixed in a few hours by mailing directly to the CFO. If you wait patiently, your patience will be tested. Save yourself the trouble and time. Amazon phone exchange delivery driver took 2k bribe from me for 5k exchange phone due to scratches. These guys don’t get good salary so these scams is how they make their bread. Boycott Amazon buy Indian. You can ask the previous chat logs to be sent to your email It still does, I work for that team. Same episode has happened with me 5-6 times. I finally gave up and stopped ordering. Kind off faced a similar bullshit experience Thanks OP for sharing I faced the same issue yesterday .Looks like this loophole is well known among amazon delivery agents throughout india. I was supposed to receive my order on 21/10/23 however in the app it was showing there was a delay when i checked the app yesterday morning it showed as order cancelled as i refused to accept the order .I didnt even receive a call from the delivery agent and the Customer service representative is asking me to place another order for the same items after waiting for the items to arrive for nearly a week.if amazon management really cares about its customers it should really look in to this rogue behaviour by its delivery partners and close this loophole . Same issue with any good international company. Amazon, Uber, etc. The company is very professional but the local drivers and delivery boys are from the rowdy areas and have no morals or character. If you gpay mein 18 rupees i can share this issue with 3 of my friends. My package was marked Delivered when in reality no one showed up. You are in slightly better off situation than me. File a case in consumer court, then tell your story, Amazon will have to listen That's the issue. The chat history isn't stored under your account. It's stored under the account of the scammer, whoever that's pretending to be you. That's why it was so hard to prove because the Customer Representative kept denying and said I can see \"your\" chat history on my end and you're not seeing anything. You can listen to the recording attached to understand the whole thing. Oh man. Why is it always the delivery people who fuck ecom business in India? Having dealt with ecom delivery businesses, I have faced this situation first hand. It is fucked up that packages can be just lost or the delivery partner will pretend to deliver your order. Our country is a low-trust society. Ecom businesses like Flipkart, Amazon etc should never give this much power to the delivery executives. It is the number problem holding back ecom penetration in our country. The delivery executives are pathetic. This is so infuriating. I feel you, man. It's my dad's birthday tomorrow, and I have ordered a gift for him. It's supposed to get delivered today, but I know this mf delivery agent won't deliver it on time. Yesterday's parcel is still showing out for delivery and when I call him it does \"hello hello hello\" as soon as I tell him my name. I want to teach this particular agent a lesson so badly but I don't know how. This thing happened with my brother on flipkart, he ordered iPhone 14 at 45k. On the delivery day, the delivery boy canceled the delivery saying the person refused the delivery. So i have a Question, is your money being deducted and not returned back after the order is cancelled ? What are you looking to buy if you don't mind me asking? Permanent solution will take time but as of now since your dad’s birthday present needs to be delivered on time, I’d have it delivered to someone else’s address if I were you because it’s urgent and you don’t wanna face the same issue which they might be doing deliberately. It's a Logitech Webcam and Samsung Smart Watch Have you tried these to see if they deliver in your pin area?: Email ajassy@amazon . Com and jeffb@amazon. Would get noticed soon There's no free lunch You're saying delivery agent impersonated your Amazon account with the details you've mentioned and cancelled the order? I've gone through the thread and this is the exact same thing that's been happening with me since past 3-4 months since I moved to Gurgaon, the latest incident being today. Consistently every order has either been delayed to the point that I preferred cancelling the order or fake delivery attempts have been made. It's been multiple times that I have contacted Amazon's customer support to complain about this behaviour and demand strict action against delivery agents but no such action has been taken. I'm literally fed up of this thing. If you found any way to resolve this please let me know OP If it’s a third party delivery company you should email the company itself, delhivery is pathetic so you’re better off emailing the executive customer relations team of Amazon. Xpressbess ceo email works better. Reviving this thread !! I get the frustration of OP, I'm too facing the same issue with Amazon on random orders. I think it started when the delivery agent cancelled my order without attempting the delivery. I complained to customer service against the delivery agent and from that day onwards orders from my account are getting automatically cancelled. Earlier I thought it was the same delivery agent who's messing up with me but then a similar issue is happening for multiple delivery locations, across states(my relatives and friends addresses). Customer service does not have any clue on the root cause. Let me know if anybody has a solution to this."
