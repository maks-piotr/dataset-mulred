India test match that one of those huge banners on the grounds in Perth/Adelaide/Brisbane read \"Sab tick (theek) hai\" - a [Google Pay](https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/advertising/lowe-lintas-ticks-all-the-boxes-in-google-pays-new-campaign/110356824) ad campaign that **does not** change when one's watching the broadcast in Tamil or Telugu. \n\n  \nOn seriously considering this, one realises that everything is being gradually Hindi-fied - the [names of government schemes](https://m.thewire.in/article/government/why-only-in-hindi-anger-over-forced-hindification-has-govt-on-the-defensive), [app notifications](https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/karnataka-man-slams-blinkit-after-feeling-threatened-by-alien-hindi-notification-netizens-call-him-jobless-11721132677680.html), the list is endless. I can't help but think that this is a concerted effort to normalize Hindi imperialism, and it's truly frustrating to see. ",

        "I've heard people say that Google and YouTube searches often publish results in Hindi, even to those living in non-Hindi speaking states.",
        "Even when it comes to investing money into linguistic research, companies now prefer [hindi](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-rolls-out-hindi-language-ai-model-in-india-as-ceo-huang-visits-9636850/lite/) over other Indian languages which, I  think, is a direct consequence of Hindi imperialism.",
        "The market risk disclaimer at the end of ipo, mutual fund Ad's used to be read out in English at one time. Now they're in hindi.",
        "True. Match highlights, by the way, are only in English and Hindi. SBI app notifications are in transliterated Hindi (if you have their YONO app). The list is endless.",
        "I live in Delhi so I thought it’s the case here coz most residents here speak Hindi. The ads in the South and other regions are being shown in Hindi too? Thats dumb as fuck ngl, it won’t make any sales since anyone who doesn’t speak Hindi often won’t try to put the effort into understanding what the ad said. \n\nThey should stick to English for everyone or local languages for each place.",
        "There's another serious issue - they seem to be interested in promoting a very specific \"variant\" of Hindi, if you will - a more sanskritized, version that is devoid of any \"foreign\" (read: Urdu/English) influence. \n\nShah knows that we won't get there right away, which is why he insists on making Hindi more \"lacheeli\" in his speeches and offers solutions like introducing \"simpler Hindi versions\" of scientific terms in English. There is a systematic machinery at work that aims to mainstream Hindi in every way possible.",
        "I'm alright with this basic movie hindi lines, atleast. What's stupid is, renaming stuffs which even native Hindi speakers would find difficult saying, is just bs",
        "But why not consider all parts of the country while renaming? And why rename things at all?",
        "If you couldn't infer from my comment, I'm against renaming stuffs too",
        "Yeah I could infer that, but why would you be okay with names that are \"easier for Hindi speakers to pronounce\"? That's what confused me about your stance.",
        "Nah, when I'm against renaming with stupid names which which even native Hindi speakers would find it difficult, doesn't mean I am okay with names that are easier for Hindi speakers. I just wanted to highlight the stupidness of the move from those in authority.",
        "Urdu is not foreign, Urdu originated in UP.",
        "I went back to a small town in Bengal after maybe 10 years. Lingo has certainly changed. There’s more people speaking Hindi. 25 years ago if you spoke Hindi you were a foreigner.",

        "Promoting Hindi is duty of the union  government as guided by Article 351 it even mentioned that the hindi used should be derived from Sanskrit root so , if you have a problem with that you are against the intent of the constitution",

        "I don't believe these companies have any ulterior motives; they are simply ignorant, dumb individuals. People who don't understand it won't bother putting in the effort to look it up, and even after paying a lot for those ad spaces, they would end up with low sales.",
        "That’s just dumb",
        "I agree with you. But would such campaigns exist in an environment where every language was given equal opportunities to exist and thrive? I don't think so. A good example is how Disney+Hotstar has conveniently removed Marathi/Punjabi/etc. from its list of broadcast options for the current test match. No political pressure = \"no one cares\" is how these companies think.",
        "I agree lol",
        ">and even after paying a lot for those ad spaces, they would end up with low sales\n\nAs for this, I'm sorry but I find this excuse extremely infuriating. This is exactly the excuse they use to promote Hindi as a \"link language\". Convenience. I'm sorry, but I'd like services to be available in all Indian languages, regardless of how low the sales are.",
        "Article 53(1) of the Constitution of India states that the President of India has the executive power of the Union.\n\nCould only find this. Which article are you talking about?",
        "They're referring to the BJP's Constitution.",
        ">People who don't understand it won't bother putting in the effort to look it up, and even after paying a lot for those ad spaces, they would end up with low sales.\n\nYou really think big companies are spending on huge ad campaigns without making use of data available to them(esp somebody like Google). Maybe you are the ignorant one.",
        "I dont have any hate for any south Indian language, but eventually to be a better country we need one common language. Hindi works in almost any northern country and still we do have regional languages. \n\nI understand south indians opposing hindi its foreign to them but can one come to south India w one southern language which will work everywhere?\nI think in the we'll just have to accept it? Even foreigners coming to India try to speak hindi I think our country is majorly represented by it, let's not give the world a point to divide us more",
        "Sorry but you are complaining about the wrong thing. Pvt companies are free to do whatever they want, if you don't like it stop using their products. It is not a necessity.\n\nThe govt related imposition is where you should focus your energy on. That is wrong and worth fighting for.",
        "yes, correct about the govt. but incorrect about the ads. \n\n\nad makers will obviously cater to their largest audience. All my ads on youtube are dubbed in Kannada.",
        "It could be due to the simple fact that broadcasting in those languages would not be as profitable, these companies are not NGOs they go for whatever is better for their bottom line. Like during IPL because it is so popular they have commentary in like 100 languages.",
        "Language is not just a matter of convenience. Its alienation results in the underrepresentation of an entire culture. I don't know how what else to say except - not everything should be seen from the lens of profitability. But I guess it's foolish to even conceive of such things in the era of late-stage capitalism.",
        "I see. I didn't know this. Thanks for clarifying!",
        ">The govt related imposition is where you should focus your energy on. That is wrong and worth fighting for.\n\nBut surely the two are linked? Are you telling me that Ambani combining with Nvidia for the development of a Hindi LLM is NOT designed to further this hegemony?",
        "na he is correct. The constitution actually says so. ",
        "The Constitution also calls us a secular, socialist republic. Are we one? Should we collectively work towards that goal too?",

        ">They will adopt whatever trend ro ensure thay are in the good books of the government.\n\nPaying money directly works way better. Or they at most do announcements at summits. They aren't spending crores on ad campaigns to get in good books.",
        "> Are you telling me that Ambani combining with Nvidia for the development of a Hindi LLM is NOT designed to further this hegemony\n\nOne, I don't think it will go much further.\n\nTwo, you really think Reliance is going to spend crores on a project just because Modiji asked them to. It gets them publicity, similar to how some companies used the whole coding in Sanskrit trend for a few months.",
        "Idc if i get downvoted but we need ONE COMMON LANGUAGE OF OUR OWN , IT firms came in south none of north indians complained abt it and instead moved there hence giving a boost to economy of southern states.",
        "Okay, how about Modi speaking in Hindi in every speech he makes on foreign land? Does that have no consequences? Several European countries (plus the US/UK to a certain extent) equate India with Hindi today. \n\nAdd this to what Ambani did and what Shah is doing, and the nexus becomes abundantly clear.",
        ">Idc if i get downvoted\n\nBasically Shah's position on Hindi imposition. Never going to happen, though. Please continue yelling.",
        "I was shocked to see ads by HSBC mutual funds in the business section of Times of India in the form of a cartoon called \"Mutual fun\", where a monkey mascot makes puns in Hindi advocating for mutual funds. Eg. The lines would read \"SIP karo, SIP karo, bhai log SIPkaro\". Cringe.",
        "You're kinda making big issue of nothing. Lonely? No life outside reddit? Karma farming? Idk but fine what is your demand?",
        "Vote for shit, get shit in return. Unless a significant majority of the country realises that anyone but the BJPee is good for the country, this ride will continue. It's all seeping into aspects of your life that you thought was beyond politicisation. Language imposition for vote gathering is just one of those. \n\nI mean, it's a country that has a mass murderer as the PM and a two bit gangster as the second in command. Future India is laughing at us.",
        "Sigh.",
        "Don’t use Google Pay.",
        "What else? \"Don't adhere to the \"Bharatiya Nyay Samhita?\"?\" lmao.",
        "Ofcourse it is. The homegenization project is a Hindutva dream from time immemorial. It's going to take all of our concentrated efforts to ensure this doesn't materialize.",
        "Tbf if the country wanted to be 'better', then it could've become so long ago. But it chose not to. I doubt Hindi would change anything",
        "How are both of them related? Gpay is not a necessity and has alternatives. BNS does affect common people.",
        "The sad thing about the mainstreaming of Hindi is, a lot of people (even well-meaning liberals) seem to think that it's \"not an important issue\". Which is really demoralising. \n\n>It's going to take all of our concentrated efforts to ensure this doesn't materialize\n\nI agree.",
        ">BNS does affect common people\n\nExactly my point. It affects common people from Kerala, TN, Assam, Meghalaya, Andhra and many other non-hindi speaking states. If your suggestion to me is, \"don't use Gpay if you have an issue with it furthering Hindi imposition\", what would you suggestI do about Hindi being imposed through the BNS?",
        "Please libs are the worst. Best to avoid them entirely because they're really just a lighter orange than the saffr0ns.",
        "True",
        "Agree. BNS is a stupid name without an alternative English name",
        "More than 60% of the viewers of Aus v. India test match don't understand English. Maybe 40% of them understands Hindi and Hinglish. 10% would understand Tamil, another 10% Kannada. \n\nIt totally makes business sense to show ads in Hindi/Hinglish alongwith English.",
        "https://preview.redd.it/r0xidq5c7z6e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88b199291feae75db7d5de446e627d4a610a2025\n\nThis is the sign outside Teen Murti Bhawan, Nehru's Prime Ministerial Residence cum office. It was a museum dedicated to him before Chauda Seena became PM. It's now been converted to a Pradhan Mantri Sangrahalaya for all PMs.\n\nWhy the fuck doesn't the English one say Prime Minister's museum instead of Hindi transliteration?",
        "It's highly probable that all of this will culminate into them renaming India as \"Bharat\". The stage for that has already been set.",
        "Ajeeb aadmi hai yaar aap",
        "If I spoke English like Modi, I would also not opt to speak English on a public foreign forum. Even if all grammatical issues are rectified, his accent is just too strong, and people will need a translator anyway.\n\nAs for his choice of Hindi, that reaches the most number of people in India. More people speak Hindi fluently than people speak English fluently in this country.",
        "For a business, everything is a matter of money. The representation of a culture rests as a responsibility of the people themselves, in the form of boycott or the government in the form of law. If neither asserts themselves, then the issue was not important anyway.",
        "Be nationalized or be colonized, these are the only two outcomes. It has been over 70 years and still no progress has been made on such a fundamental question : how do your citizens communicate with each other where there is mutual respect for each others backgrounds?\n\n\nHonestly, at this point just create a new language, either something fresh or a symphony of the languages of India.",
        "I know it kind of feels weird when the central government uses Hindi for naming schemes, but Article 351 of the Constitution literally states that it is the duty of the Indian government to promote Hindi.",
        "The Constitution is a living document that isn't static. AFAIK, it allows for provisions to amend itself. Imo, that article should be amended to account for all Indian languages. Also, if all of us have suddenly become Constitution-abiding citizens for this particular issue, why not abide by all the things mentioned in it? Are we also a secular, socialist republic then, and should we work towards being one (if we aren't already)?",
        ">feels weird\n\nNo it doesn't feel weird. It feels unfair.",
        "Yeah. Newspapers (especially TOI) - besides the regular venom-spewing, ofc - seem to have taken this up as an agenda. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen a full-page ad in the TOI that is completely in English-transliterated Hindi.",
        "Recently was sent some wedding pics from Odisha and found the word \"हल्दी\" written in declared walls during the Haldi ceremony. I was really surprised to what extent Hindi is spreading. Minor languages like Odia won't survive 500 years if this goes on. ",
        "Sigh. Reminds me of the famous quote - \"A dialect is a language without an army and a navy.\"\n\n>Minor languages\n\nI'd refrain from calling it a \"minor language\" or a \"vernacular language\" or (people's favourite) \"dialect\". All of these are full-fledged languages. The reason why they're seen as \"minor\" is because they don't have the political backing that Hindi does.",
        "IT firms came to the south because there was a lot more educated workforce there and better conditions. The north is good at breeding. If any language should be the unifying language it should be English, which is a lot more useful economically too.",
        "I’m not sure whether those numbers are right or not. \n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken language in India. People either converse in English, or their regional language most of the time. The South has a lot of people too. Isolating them just to appeal to the Hindi viewers isn’t very smart",
        "Wasn't there a rumor/news that if India disowns the name India i.e. gets renamed to Bharat, Pakistan was looking to grab that name for itself? I think BJP won't change it just because of that reason.",
        ">I think BJP won't change it just because of that reason.\n\nCould be xD. But I hear them say \"Bharat\" a lot more than \"India\" these days. Maybe you're right. There's that Pakistan angle. Plus, it was mostly a counter to the INDIA alliance's name. I still think that it won't come as a surprise to most of us if they actually end up doing it.",
        "\"heard\"",
        "To those how are saying we need a single language i just want to say that they are right and we should use english as a common language",
        ">English is the most widely spoken language in India.\n\n[No it isn't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population)  Only a total of 16% people can speak it, whereas [40% people speak Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers_in_India). Tamil can be spoken by just 7%, Kannada by 5%. All 4 south Indian languages together are spoken by 20% of Indians.\n\nIf you are advertising on a very costly billboard, using Hindi will give you highest ROI compared to any other language (if your product is targetted at masses).",
        "I have actually heard people say that. When someone pointed out that it's not the case for a majority of others, I thanked them and have changed my opinion on this now. What's your point?",
        "Even if your numbers are right - \n\n>40% people speak Hindi\n\nWhy do you think this is the case? It is a result of Hindi imperialism over the decades. Several linguistic scholars have found that a person who speaks a so-called \"dialect\" of Hindi such as Maithli have mentioned their mother tongue as Hindi in censuses because they either thought that their language is a) inferior to Hindi b) same as Hindi. Both of which are false.",
        "There isn't anymore urdu signboards in UP. They were blacked out and darkened or removed.",
        "Sigh! I see.",
        "Even spoken Hindi has changed. I'm from Delhi, like 6-7th gen Delhi. We've married men and women from UP to Punjab but remained Delhite. When I was young the words, idioms, style, accent were different from what I hear even in my own family. \n\nFirst is the Punjabi influence. Even in my way of speaking, I speak with a Punjabi accent even though I can hardly speak a sentence or two of it. Back in the day only the Muhajirs had that accent. Families coming out of Old Delhi didn't.(On that note, we actually are Punjabi with a very Punjabi last name but left the area near Peshawar in the 18th century)\n\nThe words have gotten pure hindi, so much so that I hardly hear the language of my younger days anymore. It used to be sprinkled with Urdu, Persian and even arabic. Common tongue in Delhi was a mix of all those languages+English. The English(and Punjabi) is still there but all other languages are gone. \n\nThe difference is a bit jarring since I visit Delhi only occasionally now, since the mid 00's.",
        "Why would Pakistan, a country which even imposed Urdu on a population whose native tongue is not Urdu, use a Sanskrit word for its name? The word Pakistan is not merely Urdu but also loaded with the promise that here, things will run on *sharia*.",
        "So you want to say \nThe two Gujaratis running the government and his Gujarati business friends want to convert national language to Hindi and not Gujarati?\nSeems like they are actually trying to unite India on a single language",
        "South Indian and their language.\n\nThe simple things you baboons don't understand that numbers are everything and way more people speak, understand Hindi than any other language in India.",
        "English is not our own language and is south indians are more educated then why do they demand reservation in MNCs. All this education and you have to cry abt language?. All I've seen is south indians being conservative. Only up bihar is the breeding ground you're talking abt and north indians hate them even more. Stop generalising north indians its like saying south indians are conservative because all my mallu friends are conservative",
        "Tbh in the beginning I was in favour of promoting Hindi extensively. I mean having a common language would be very efficient right? And being north-central India I shouldn't have any issue with it. But no \nHindi is rapidly displacing many native languages like the Pahadi languages, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri etc. Terming these as dialects of Hindi just diminishes their value, I speak 3 \"dialects\" and they are in no way similar to each other. If that's not enough then with Haryanvi, Bhojpuri etc. we are actively discouraged from learning our own language (external and internal pressure) and why? Because it's \"gawar\" or villageish. I get that Hindi is way more \"formal\" than our native languages but we shouldn't be looked down upon for speaking our native tongues, this is just Hindi imposition but the North Indians are actually supporting it. South Indians and Northeast people have conserved their language very well. Atleast the Paharis recognise that their native languages are dying.",
        "Hindi ain't our language either. Don't impose that trash on south india if you don't want English.\n\nIt's not just Bihar...Bihar, UP, MP, Rajasthan etc...the combined population is embarrassing.",
        "Odia is in no way a minor language",
        "One language unifies is a myth. If that were so, the whole world would be unified behind English now. ",
        "True. It's also a direct consequence of nationalism. It's an extension of the \"one nation, one election, one leader, one party\" thinking.",
        ">Hindi is rapidly displacing many native languages like the Pahadi languages, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri etc\n\nExactly! \n\n>Terming these as dialects of Hindi just diminishes their value\n\nI completely agree with you. \n\nWhat people don't realise is that the mainstreaming of one language in most cases results in the death of many others.",
        "Let's accept it. Perhaps by accepting the reality, we can save minor languages. Odia don't even have simply Wikipedia pages, what else proofs you need to consider it a minor languages. ",
        "My use of the term is unproductive sense, accept the linguistic reality and through that perhaps we can save them. Especially, the headwind from English and Hindi is extremely high and I doubt how long weaker languages will survive if people remains in a denial mode. ",

If that was a jibe at me, it's quite amusing that you associate a discussion on Hindi imperialism with \"semi-intellectualism\". Where do you stand on it, by the way?

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I'm a regular cricket enjoyer and it struck me, while watching a recent Aus v.

I can't help but think that this is a concerted effort to normalize Hindi imperialism, and it's truly frustrating to see.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "As a hindu hindi speaker living in hindustan i agree why do I see assamese ads a lot ? I am not even from Assam😭 Meanwhile, it is way easier to learn French or German in Indian schools. Wanna learn an Indian language? Get the fuck off! I've heard people say that Google and YouTube searches often publish results in Hindi, even to those living in non-Hindi speaking states. Even when it comes to investing money into linguistic research, companies now prefer [hindi](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-rolls-out-hindi-language-ai-model-in-india-as-ceo-huang-visits-9636850/lite/) over other Indian languages which, I think, is a direct consequence of Hindi imperialism. The market risk disclaimer at the end of ipo, mutual fund Ad's used to be read out in English at one time. Now they're in hindi. True. Match highlights, by the way, are only in English and Hindi. SBI app notifications are in transliterated Hindi (if you have their YONO app). The list is endless. I live in Delhi so I thought it’s the case here coz most residents here speak Hindi. The ads in the South and other regions are being shown in Hindi too? Thats dumb as fuck ngl, it won’t make any sales since anyone who doesn’t speak Hindi often won’t try to put the effort into understanding what the ad said. They should stick to English for everyone or local languages for each place. There's another serious issue - they seem to be interested in promoting a very specific \"variant\" of Hindi, if you will - a more sanskritized, version that is devoid of any \"foreign\" (read: Urdu/English) influence. Shah knows that we won't get there right away, which is why he insists on making Hindi more \"lacheeli\" in his speeches and offers solutions like introducing \"simpler Hindi versions\" of scientific terms in English. There is a systematic machinery at work that aims to mainstream Hindi in every way possible. I'm alright with this basic movie hindi lines, atleast. What's stupid is, renaming stuffs which even native Hindi speakers would find difficult saying, is just bs But why not consider all parts of the country while renaming? And why rename things at all? If you couldn't infer from my comment, I'm against renaming stuffs too Yeah I could infer that, but why would you be okay with names that are \"easier for Hindi speakers to pronounce\"? That's what confused me about your stance. Nah, when I'm against renaming with stupid names which which even native Hindi speakers would find it difficult, doesn't mean I am okay with names that are easier for Hindi speakers. I just wanted to highlight the stupidness of the move from those in authority. Urdu is not foreign, Urdu originated in UP. I went back to a small town in Bengal after maybe 10 years. Lingo has certainly changed. There’s more people speaking Hindi. 25 years ago if you spoke Hindi you were a foreigner. Yeah I'm aware, I meant that the BJP sees Urdu that way. Promoting Hindi is duty of the union government as guided by Article 351 it even mentioned that the hindi used should be derived from Sanskrit root so , if you have a problem with that you are against the intent of the constitution I've had similar experiences, yes. I don't believe these companies have any ulterior motives; they are simply ignorant, dumb individuals. People who don't understand it won't bother putting in the effort to look it up, and even after paying a lot for those ad spaces, they would end up with low sales. That’s just dumb I agree with you. But would such campaigns exist in an environment where every language was given equal opportunities to exist and thrive? I don't think so. A good example is how Disney+Hotstar has conveniently removed Marathi/Punjabi/etc. from its list of broadcast options for the current test match. No political pressure = \"no one cares\" is how these companies think. I agree lol >and even after paying a lot for those ad spaces, they would end up with low sales As for this, I'm sorry but I find this excuse extremely infuriating. This is exactly the excuse they use to promote Hindi as a \"link language\". Convenience. I'm sorry, but I'd like services to be available in all Indian languages, regardless of how low the sales are. Article 53(1) of the Constitution of India states that the President of India has the executive power of the Union. Could only find this. Which article are you talking about? They're referring to the BJP's Constitution. >People who don't understand it won't bother putting in the effort to look it up, and even after paying a lot for those ad spaces, they would end up with low sales. You really think big companies are spending on huge ad campaigns without making use of data available to them(esp somebody like Google). Maybe you are the ignorant one. I dont have any hate for any south Indian language, but eventually to be a better country we need one common language. Hindi works in almost any northern country and still we do have regional languages. I understand south indians opposing hindi its foreign to them but can one come to south India w one southern language which will work everywhere? I think in the we'll just have to accept it? Even foreigners coming to India try to speak hindi I think our country is majorly represented by it, let's not give the world a point to divide us more Sorry but you are complaining about the wrong thing. Pvt companies are free to do whatever they want, if you don't like it stop using their products. It is not a necessity. The govt related imposition is where you should focus your energy on. That is wrong and worth fighting for. yes, correct about the govt. but incorrect about the ads. ad makers will obviously cater to their largest audience. All my ads on youtube are dubbed in Kannada. It could be due to the simple fact that broadcasting in those languages would not be as profitable, these companies are not NGOs they go for whatever is better for their bottom line. Like during IPL because it is so popular they have commentary in like 100 languages. Language is not just a matter of convenience. Its alienation results in the underrepresentation of an entire culture. I don't know how what else to say except - not everything should be seen from the lens of profitability. But I guess it's foolish to even conceive of such things in the era of late-stage capitalism. I see. I didn't know this. Thanks for clarifying! >The govt related imposition is where you should focus your energy on. That is wrong and worth fighting for. But surely the two are linked? Are you telling me that Ambani combining with Nvidia for the development of a Hindi LLM is NOT designed to further this hegemony? na he is correct. The constitution actually says so. The Constitution also calls us a secular, socialist republic. Are we one? Should we collectively work towards that goal too? Private companies dont exist in a vaccuum. They will adopt whatever trend ro ensure thay are in the good books of the government. Nah nah, unfortunately he is right. >I dont have any hate for any south Indian language but you see them as \"less important\" which is the root of the problem. >to be a better country Lol, okay. >They will adopt whatever trend ro ensure thay are in the good books of the government. Paying money directly works way better. Or they at most do announcements at summits. They aren't spending crores on ad campaigns to get in good books. > Are you telling me that Ambani combining with Nvidia for the development of a Hindi LLM is NOT designed to further this hegemony One, I don't think it will go much further. Two, you really think Reliance is going to spend crores on a project just because Modiji asked them to. It gets them publicity, similar to how some companies used the whole coding in Sanskrit trend for a few months. Idc if i get downvoted but we need ONE COMMON LANGUAGE OF OUR OWN , IT firms came in south none of north indians complained abt it and instead moved there hence giving a boost to economy of southern states. Okay, how about Modi speaking in Hindi in every speech he makes on foreign land? Does that have no consequences? Several European countries (plus the US/UK to a certain extent) equate India with Hindi today. Add this to what Ambani did and what Shah is doing, and the nexus becomes abundantly clear. >Idc if i get downvoted Basically Shah's position on Hindi imposition. Never going to happen, though. Please continue yelling. I was shocked to see ads by HSBC mutual funds in the business section of Times of India in the form of a cartoon called \"Mutual fun\", where a monkey mascot makes puns in Hindi advocating for mutual funds. Eg. The lines would read \"SIP karo, SIP karo, bhai log SIPkaro\". Cringe. You're kinda making big issue of nothing. Lonely? No life outside reddit? Karma farming? Idk but fine what is your demand? Vote for shit, get shit in return. Unless a significant majority of the country realises that anyone but the BJPee is good for the country, this ride will continue. It's all seeping into aspects of your life that you thought was beyond politicisation. Language imposition for vote gathering is just one of those. I mean, it's a country that has a mass murderer as the PM and a two bit gangster as the second in command. Future India is laughing at us. Sigh. Don’t use Google Pay. What else? \"Don't adhere to the \"Bharatiya Nyay Samhita?\"?\" lmao. Ofcourse it is. The homegenization project is a Hindutva dream from time immemorial. It's going to take all of our concentrated efforts to ensure this doesn't materialize. Tbf if the country wanted to be 'better', then it could've become so long ago. But it chose not to. I doubt Hindi would change anything How are both of them related? Gpay is not a necessity and has alternatives. BNS does affect common people. The sad thing about the mainstreaming of Hindi is, a lot of people (even well-meaning liberals) seem to think that it's \"not an important issue\". Which is really demoralising. >It's going to take all of our concentrated efforts to ensure this doesn't materialize I agree. >BNS does affect common people Exactly my point. It affects common people from Kerala, TN, Assam, Meghalaya, Andhra and many other non-hindi speaking states. If your suggestion to me is, \"don't use Gpay if you have an issue with it furthering Hindi imposition\", what would you suggestI do about Hindi being imposed through the BNS? Please libs are the worst. Best to avoid them entirely because they're really just a lighter orange than the saffr0ns. True Agree. BNS is a stupid name without an alternative English name More than 60% of the viewers of Aus v. India test match don't understand English. Maybe 40% of them understands Hindi and Hinglish. 10% would understand Tamil, another 10% Kannada. It totally makes business sense to show ads in Hindi/Hinglish alongwith English. This is the sign outside Teen Murti Bhawan, Nehru's Prime Ministerial Residence cum office. It was a museum dedicated to him before Chauda Seena became PM. It's now been converted to a Pradhan Mantri Sangrahalaya for all PMs. Why the fuck doesn't the English one say Prime Minister's museum instead of Hindi transliteration? It's highly probable that all of this will culminate into them renaming India as \"Bharat\". The stage for that has already been set. Ajeeb aadmi hai yaar aap If I spoke English like Modi, I would also not opt to speak English on a public foreign forum. Even if all grammatical issues are rectified, his accent is just too strong, and people will need a translator anyway. As for his choice of Hindi, that reaches the most number of people in India. More people speak Hindi fluently than people speak English fluently in this country. For a business, everything is a matter of money. The representation of a culture rests as a responsibility of the people themselves, in the form of boycott or the government in the form of law. If neither asserts themselves, then the issue was not important anyway. Be nationalized or be colonized, these are the only two outcomes. It has been over 70 years and still no progress has been made on such a fundamental question : how do your citizens communicate with each other where there is mutual respect for each others backgrounds? Honestly, at this point just create a new language, either something fresh or a symphony of the languages of India. I know it kind of feels weird when the central government uses Hindi for naming schemes, but Article 351 of the Constitution literally states that it is the duty of the Indian government to promote Hindi. The Constitution is a living document that isn't static. AFAIK, it allows for provisions to amend itself. Imo, that article should be amended to account for all Indian languages. Also, if all of us have suddenly become Constitution-abiding citizens for this particular issue, why not abide by all the things mentioned in it? Are we also a secular, socialist republic then, and should we work towards being one (if we aren't already)? >feels weird No it doesn't feel weird. It feels unfair. Yeah. Newspapers (especially TOI) - besides the regular venom-spewing, ofc - seem to have taken this up as an agenda. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen a full-page ad in the TOI that is completely in English-transliterated Hindi. Recently was sent some wedding pics from Odisha and found the word \"हल्दी\" written in declared walls during the Haldi ceremony. I was really surprised to what extent Hindi is spreading. Minor languages like Odia won't survive 500 years if this goes on. Sigh. Reminds me of the famous quote - \"A dialect is a language without an army and a navy.\" >Minor languages I'd refrain from calling it a \"minor language\" or a \"vernacular language\" or (people's favourite) \"dialect\". All of these are full-fledged languages. The reason why they're seen as \"minor\" is because they don't have the political backing that Hindi does. IT firms came to the south because there was a lot more educated workforce there and better conditions. The north is good at breeding. If any language should be the unifying language it should be English, which is a lot more useful economically too. I’m not sure whether those numbers are right or not. English is the most widely spoken language in India. People either converse in English, or their regional language most of the time. The South has a lot of people too. Isolating them just to appeal to the Hindi viewers isn’t very smart Wasn't there a rumor/news that if India disowns the name India i.e. gets renamed to Bharat, Pakistan was looking to grab that name for itself? I think BJP won't change it just because of that reason. >I think BJP won't change it just because of that reason. Could be xD. But I hear them say \"Bharat\" a lot more than \"India\" these days. Maybe you're right. There's that Pakistan angle. Plus, it was mostly a counter to the INDIA alliance's name. I still think that it won't come as a surprise to most of us if they actually end up doing it. \"heard\" To those how are saying we need a single language i just want to say that they are right and we should use english as a common language >English is the most widely spoken language in India. [No it isn't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_English-speaking_population) Only a total of 16% people can speak it, whereas [40% people speak Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers_in_India). Tamil can be spoken by just 7%, Kannada by 5%. All 4 south Indian languages together are spoken by 20% of Indians. If you are advertising on a very costly billboard, using Hindi will give you highest ROI compared to any other language (if your product is targetted at masses). I have actually heard people say that. When someone pointed out that it's not the case for a majority of others, I thanked them and have changed my opinion on this now. What's your point? Even if your numbers are right - >40% people speak Hindi Why do you think this is the case? It is a result of Hindi imperialism over the decades. Several linguistic scholars have found that a person who speaks a so-called \"dialect\" of Hindi such as Maithli have mentioned their mother tongue as Hindi in censuses because they either thought that their language is a) inferior to Hindi b) same as Hindi. Both of which are false. There isn't anymore urdu signboards in UP. They were blacked out and darkened or removed. Sigh! I see. Even spoken Hindi has changed. I'm from Delhi, like 6-7th gen Delhi. We've married men and women from UP to Punjab but remained Delhite. When I was young the words, idioms, style, accent were different from what I hear even in my own family. First is the Punjabi influence. Even in my way of speaking, I speak with a Punjabi accent even though I can hardly speak a sentence or two of it. Back in the day only the Muhajirs had that accent. Families coming out of Old Delhi didn't.(On that note, we actually are Punjabi with a very Punjabi last name but left the area near Peshawar in the 18th century) The words have gotten pure hindi, so much so that I hardly hear the language of my younger days anymore. It used to be sprinkled with Urdu, Persian and even arabic. Common tongue in Delhi was a mix of all those languages+English. The English(and Punjabi) is still there but all other languages are gone. The difference is a bit jarring since I visit Delhi only occasionally now, since the mid 00's. Why would Pakistan, a country which even imposed Urdu on a population whose native tongue is not Urdu, use a Sanskrit word for its name? The word Pakistan is not merely Urdu but also loaded with the promise that here, things will run on *sharia*. So you want to say The two Gujaratis running the government and his Gujarati business friends want to convert national language to Hindi and not Gujarati? Seems like they are actually trying to unite India on a single language South Indian and their language. The simple things you baboons don't understand that numbers are everything and way more people speak, understand Hindi than any other language in India. English is not our own language and is south indians are more educated then why do they demand reservation in MNCs. All this education and you have to cry abt language?. All I've seen is south indians being conservative. Only up bihar is the breeding ground you're talking abt and north indians hate them even more. Stop generalising north indians its like saying south indians are conservative because all my mallu friends are conservative Tbh in the beginning I was in favour of promoting Hindi extensively. I mean having a common language would be very efficient right? And being north-central India I shouldn't have any issue with it. But no Hindi is rapidly displacing many native languages like the Pahadi languages, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri etc. Terming these as dialects of Hindi just diminishes their value, I speak 3 \"dialects\" and they are in no way similar to each other. If that's not enough then with Haryanvi, Bhojpuri etc. we are actively discouraged from learning our own language (external and internal pressure) and why? Because it's \"gawar\" or villageish. I get that Hindi is way more \"formal\" than our native languages but we shouldn't be looked down upon for speaking our native tongues, this is just Hindi imposition but the North Indians are actually supporting it. South Indians and Northeast people have conserved their language very well. Atleast the Paharis recognise that their native languages are dying. Hindi ain't our language either. Don't impose that trash on south india if you don't want English. It's not just Bihar...Bihar, UP, MP, Rajasthan etc...the combined population is embarrassing. Odia is in no way a minor language One language unifies is a myth. If that were so, the whole world would be unified behind English now. True. It's also a direct consequence of nationalism. It's an extension of the \"one nation, one election, one leader, one party\" thinking. >Hindi is rapidly displacing many native languages like the Pahadi languages, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri etc Exactly! >Terming these as dialects of Hindi just diminishes their value I completely agree with you. What people don't realise is that the mainstreaming of one language in most cases results in the death of many others. Let's accept it. Perhaps by accepting the reality, we can save minor languages. Odia don't even have simply Wikipedia pages, what else proofs you need to consider it a minor languages. My use of the term is unproductive sense, accept the linguistic reality and through that perhaps we can save them. Especially, the headwind from English and Hindi is extremely high and I doubt how long weaker languages will survive if people remains in a denial mode. I don't give blanket statements about something I am not fully aware of. And reddit off lately has become a cesspool of semi intellect try hards trying to sound smart. Get a job my man >I don't give blanket statements about something I am not fully aware of Good for you! >And reddit off lately has become a cesspool of semi intellect try hards trying to sound smart Lmao. If that was a jibe at me, it's quite amusing that you associate a discussion on Hindi imperialism with \"semi-intellectualism\". Where do you stand on it, by the way? Or are you just here to talk about this one thing? Also - >reddit off lately has become a cesspool of semi intellect try hards trying to sound smart I thought you don't like \"blanket statements\" and generalisations? Are you a fellow semi-intellectual, then? xD So who you guys identify as? Commies? As sane people who want equality, justice and liberty for all. Too abstract, then every single person from majority of the ideologies will say the same thing (on the surface) ✌🏾 Do not care. That's how I identify. same here, everyone identifies and assumes their own ideology is just and fair. That’s the fault of you Odia people. Odia has a rich history, that’s what I meant"
