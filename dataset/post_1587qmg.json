        "> We want a return on investment in our lifetime through social security measures.

Education where I can send my child, healthcare of a reasonable quality, unemployment or old age pension on which I can live. Europe has almost 50% tax but check out the benefits...People are proud to be a taxpayer there.\n\nYou should be proud to be a taxpayer here too. You're one of the rare ones who's actually helping eradicate poverty and are uplifting the country through your contributions.\n\nPlease stop this comparison with Western Europe. We are simply NOT that. Neither in terms of where we are economically nor in terms of demographic or population size or religion mix or history (of colonization) or any other factor. You can talk about specific things they do as an aspirational goal for us to achieve - but a direct comparison is just plain silly.\n\nIf you want to do a real comparison, the only country to compare with is China. Because they are the only country with a similar population and demographic and history. Or perhaps Brazil.\n\nYou say you want a \"return in investment\" but your taxes are not an investment. And the \"returns\" are meant for all of India's population and not just you. You're trivializing the infrastructure development made in roads and rail but only focusing on the things where progress still needs to be made.\n\nFrankly, you're doing a lot of cherry picking and using double standards. You talk about education - India has plenty of top notch colleges that are virtually free and provide world class education. What's even your problem?\n\nYou talk about healthcare - it is certainly available - maybe not provided by the government although even there, you have the AIIMS etc which are quite top notch. But assuming you earn a decent amount of money, what's even your complaint?\n\nThese two things you mentioned - they cost a quarter of million dollars in the US for both education and healthcare. Are you willing to spend that kind of money for top notch education and healthcare??\n\nYou also mention old age pension as your last item. You realize that earning a good salary in India allows you a tremendous amount of savings potential. Many/most people are easily able to save more than half their salary as spending caps out after some point. Are you saying you or many people living a cushy upper middle class life are NOT able to save enough money for retirement?\n\nLike, what the heck do you even want? The government to provide you 1 lac every month in retirement because you paid your taxes??",

        "Have you not heard about surcharge and cess? With surcharge and cess, the maximum tax rate in India is 39%.",
        "As far as I know for some Health and education it is 4% and for income above 50 lakhs it is 10% but this percentage is applied on the tax. So even if you pay 30% tax, after applying the surcharge your tax would be 30*(1+0.04+0.10) which will still be less than 35%. Also, very few people in India have income > 50 lakhs and 30% is applied on the max bracket only, so surcharge is a very small amount, still it would be much lesser than Europe. Please correct me if I am missing something or doing some wrong calculations.",
        "There are higher slabs too for surcharge going upto 25%. \n\nSurcharge applies on Total tax + cess not base tax rate.\n\nSo it is x is the income. The base income tax is 0.3x. With cess it is 0.312x. With 25% surcharge it is 0.39 or 39%.",
        "Don't you think completely digitizing our currency and eliminating cash completely can solve many such issues? I feel our government no matter it's flaws has done a lot to take us in that direction, and eventually GST and other indirect taxes will become impossible to evade.\nBack in my parents time salaried individuals were in for life, starting a business was a pipe dream and imagining a better life within India than abroad was impossible, so things have definitely become much better for salaried individuals like us, and will definitely continue to do so. Same can't be said for the west, where quality of life is slowly falling"

This is why the system is getting bloated and running a deficit. I didn’t understand how we paid 50% of our income as income tax. The highest slab is only 30%. So technically the income tax paid is always less than 30%. Indirect tax like GST vat cess But there is such tax in Europe also, one of friend there feels India is much better as the min European VAT is 17% and goes as high as 27% apart from the >40% income tax which in countries like France is 54%. I think India is better, but at the same time I fell that infrastructure and basic facilities should definitely improve here. Someone said 'u get a cheap maid/labour and what not cz 1% population paying those high taxes, and govt subsidies many things, remove that and companies not gonna get workers who waste 12-14hr daily for 20k per month, this will reduce companies profit also it'll reduce ur income as well Like govt heavily subsidized crop production that's why food prices don't go through roof except some seasonal tomato prices (farmers get chillers bt that's another story) Obviously maybe 50% gone to pockets of corruption Some of you haven't seen your country and it shows. Paid 20 lacs tax this year as per my income... Fuckall we get from govt We want a return on investment in our lifetime through social security measures. No point telling me that I can go to kashmir by train or drive to Itanagar on a road if I live in Kanyakumari. Education where I can send my child, healthcare of a reasonable quality, unemployment or old age pension on which I can live. Europe has almost 50% tax but check out the benefits...People are proud to be a taxpayer there. Lol. Frankly the salaried pay for all those who don’t pay tax. Indians in Reddit really need a reality check to realise that India is among the poorest countries in the world. Pay your fair share and encourage others to pay. Some dickhead wants unemployment for being unemployed because he paid tax. Do you know how much a typical farmer makes? Or the lowest paid govt salaried employees? Or any of the 800 odd million in real rural India? All of your tax (even VAT and petrol) is more than paid back by the extremely suppressed food prices you pay. We are the only country where the rich “taxpayers” are subsidised by extremely poor farmers. Your tax and a lot of borrowing pays for the food schemes, medical schemes for BPL that just about keeps them alive. Some idiot says he has no roads, no water or fresh air anywhere in India. Step out of your make believe polluted Bengaluru suburb and smell the Chikmaglur coffee. India is a very poor country just about able to feed and clothe all of it’s people. The broadest shoulders have to bear the burden. > We want a return on investment in our lifetime through social security measures.

Europe has almost 50% tax but check out the benefits...People are proud to be a taxpayer there. You should be proud to be a taxpayer here too. You're one of the rare ones who's actually helping eradicate poverty and are uplifting the country through your contributions. Please stop this comparison with Western Europe. We are simply NOT that. Neither in terms of where we are economically nor in terms of demographic or population size or religion mix or history (of colonization) or any other factor. You can talk about specific things they do as an aspirational goal for us to achieve - but a direct comparison is just plain silly. If you want to do a real comparison, the only country to compare with is China. Because they are the only country with a similar population and demographic and history. Or perhaps Brazil. You say you want a \"return in investment\" but your taxes are not an investment. And the \"returns\" are meant for all of India's population and not just you. You're trivializing the infrastructure development made in roads and rail but only focusing on the things where progress still needs to be made. Frankly, you're doing a lot of cherry picking and using double standards. You talk about education - India has plenty of top notch colleges that are virtually free and provide world class education. What's even your problem? You talk about healthcare - it is certainly available - maybe not provided by the government although even there, you have the AIIMS etc which are quite top notch. But assuming you earn a decent amount of money, what's even your complaint? These two things you mentioned - they cost a quarter of million dollars in the US for both education and healthcare. Are you willing to spend that kind of money for top notch education and healthcare?? You also mention old age pension as your last item. You realize that earning a good salary in India allows you a tremendous amount of savings potential. Many/most people are easily able to save more than half their salary as spending caps out after some point. Are you saying you or many people living a cushy upper middle class life are NOT able to save enough money for retirement? Like, what the heck do you even want? The government to provide you 1 lac every month in retirement because you paid your taxes?? Business Karo relax kro. Dear saar, have you heard of the temple we are building and the statues? xoxo, gormint Have you not heard about surcharge and cess? With surcharge and cess, the maximum tax rate in India is 39%. As far as I know for some Health and education it is 4% and for income above 50 lakhs it is 10% but this percentage is applied on the tax. So even if you pay 30% tax, after applying the surcharge your tax would be 30*(1+0.04+0.10) which will still be less than 35%. Also, very few people in India have income > 50 lakhs and 30% is applied on the max bracket only, so surcharge is a very small amount, still it would be much lesser than Europe. Please correct me if I am missing something or doing some wrong calculations. There are higher slabs too for surcharge going upto 25%. Surcharge applies on Total tax + cess not base tax rate. So it is x is the income. The base income tax is 0.3x. With cess it is 0.312x. With 25% surcharge it is 0.39 or 39%. Don't you think completely digitizing our currency and eliminating cash completely can solve many such issues? I feel our government no matter it's flaws has done a lot to take us in that direction, and eventually GST and other indirect taxes will become impossible to evade. Back in my parents time salaried individuals were in for life, starting a business was a pipe dream and imagining a better life within India than abroad was impossible, so things have definitely become much better for salaried individuals like us, and will definitely continue to do so. Same can't be said for the west, where quality of life is slowly falling"
