    "selftext": "I'm from UP, I read the Bill, and here are some concerns:\n\n1. &amp;#x200B;\n\n[Section 3](https://preview.redd.it/tdgmdbtydd161.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c091561c4e4f1f9ef03867f7282a25bf902f727a)\n\nMain issue is with the term \"allurement\". Definition of Allurement in section 2(a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zk936aqfed161.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31bc211b50dcb6a4d4450a440215ec29157fb837\n\nPrimary concern is that this will be misused to target dalits and bahujans who adopt Budhism to escape structural caste based discrimination, marginalisation and violence from Hindus. This phrase is just vague enough for sanghi vigilantes to file FIRs. \n\n2**. Exception for reconversion to \"previous religion\"**. This is found in other state's similar legislations (for ex. Jharkhand permits return to \"ancestor's religion\"). This is a sneaky little way to allow for all the ghar wapasi/shuddhi. Sanghis love to argue that everyone in this country was once \"hindu\".\n\n**3. Who can file a complaint? Literally ANYBODY.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6gq73lffgd161.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f3a78b485796a78eb73948b34f7c75ba3949019\n\nFreedom of Religion (Article 25, Constitution of India) is a personal right. How is a lay person allowed to lodge complaint? What does \"aggrieved\" mean? Why is the locus standi so wide?\n\n4. Declaration to DM one month before conversion from the person trying to convert and the religious priest undertaking the ceremony:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x69q4l4lid161.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc5cbbdc5dced7a4ee8c947521dd0f036f783539\n\nConcern: Information can be leaked and publicized. Minority community and Budhist orgs converting dalits will be particularly at risk. One month is a long and sufficient time to intimidate and harass. Even after submitting the Declaration, the DM will conduct a police verification. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3wt3xo7jd161.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9633867e187f991300d7c4c9b466504403e0b9d\n\nAs long as there is a BJP sarkaar in UP, this is an additional tool for intimidation. \n\nIn case anyone had any misconceptions here are more tools for intimidation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kpbrk3w3kd161.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b83524bb649cbff9939716dd1d1df0e95f4d270\n\n5. Who all can be punished under this Act:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/03nf2bdpkd161.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fc4a1479377a65d4257195ef47c6719f0326b81\n\nAgain, frighteningly broad ambit of who all can be booked under this Act. FRIGHTENINGLY BROAD. What does \"counsel\" and \"convince\" mean? If my friend wants to convert, talks to me about it, and I tell her to follow her heart, have I \"counselled\" or \"convinced\" her? I am a criminal now?\n\n6. **Burden of Proof on the accused:** Normally (there can be exceptions if statues provide for them) in criminal law, whoever lays a claim must present evidence or proof. So if a random person alleges that A converted in contravention of this law, burden of proof has to be on this random person. But instead, A now has to prove his innocence. In other words, MORE HARASSMENT.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsehkii2md161.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e632931c528ae0809a9df10ccb3a55d4cbbbfaed",
