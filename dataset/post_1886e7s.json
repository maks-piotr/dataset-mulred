        "He should have use protonmail, poor guy is now gonna get caught",
        "this has definite chaddi energy",
        "Like how tough is it to get to know which email is the safest, he could have gotten away easily with ten more minutes of research",
        "This is a hoax for sure. Just hoping that police are able to trace them and strict action is taken against them.",
        "Even protonmail is required to reveal your ip address if law enforcement asks for it.",
        "Didnt know that but I know if you use enough precautions it is very tough to track a person from email, if I remember properly even the FBI couldn't find a black web drug trafficker until he revealed his identity by mistake.",

        "They had a hard time forcing twitter to certain account. Pulling this one off would be tough.\n\nIt's not the technical trail I'm worried. Whoever done it, could brag to his friends about it",
