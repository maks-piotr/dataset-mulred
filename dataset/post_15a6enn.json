However, I noticed that your last film was \"Housefull 2\" in 2017, and I wonder why you left Bollywood. I sincerely hope that you consider making a comeback, especially through OTT platforms, as they are the next big thing in the entertainment industry. With OTT, you can collaborate with pioneers like TVF, TSP, SonyLiv, Netflix, etc., and reach a wider audience. Your fans, including myself, would be thrilled to see you back on the screen. Please do let us know the reason behind your departure from Bollywood. We miss you and love you, Zareen, and eagerly await your return.",

Great story and great cast too especially karan singh grover and your performance. You looked really beautiful and i loved your outfits especially that pink flower kind of outfit which you wore during the scene where you congratulated Sharman Joshi and his brother. The songs were my favourite part too especially wajah tum ho song. My rating for the film - ( 4 / 5 ). Worth rewatching\n\n\n\nI would just like to ask did you enjoy watching the film hate story 3 and how much would you rate it?   would you say that it is one of the best films in your career (noting that you did hum bhi akele tum bhi akele which was so good).

What type of fitness regimen and mental strength did it require? Any sacrifices you had to make? Do you feel like main stream Bollywood can't make good comedy movies anymore for the theatres without being downright offensive or idiotic? Say, movies like Housefull 4 we're full of ableist jokes, while intelligently made films like Kathal/Monica O My Darling choose OTT releases because they think they wouldn't find an audience in theatres.

And did you faced any such incidents? Hi! What was your favourite movie you took part in? Hi , So when I entered this industry , I was literally like a lost child since I don't come from a filmy background so it made me feel really happy being compared to Katrina as I was her fan too and found her really pretty.

On that note, keep shining‚ú®Ô∏è Barbie or Oppenheimer? You've been part of many mass masala movies where the actor, director, or producers have been known to be eccentric and/or not concerned about conventional film making. Yet, somehow, these movies still make money due to an ardent fan following for the leads. When you are on these sets, is it hard for your to get your voice heard as an artist? Or do you just approach them as a way of making easy money, since you don't have to use your brain so much owing to the one-dimensional nature of the characters? How tough it is to be an influencer and deal with all the negativity? how do you cope with the social media pressure? Hi ZK..! It's always a pleasure to watch your movies.

You should start a vlog channel :D would love to see it Reddit pe kaise aana hua? Nice to have you here, I missed you! who is your favourite actress amongst thess kareena deepika priyanka alia Now last Salman related question. Does he plan his look in his films himself? Because most of them don't look like they're done by professional makeup artists. Next/upcoming movies? Hi, hows your journey so far? Do you ever feel like switch career or try something more different ? :) Hi Zareen, did u try venturing to other movie industries in India, did u get such offers from outside Bollywood What's the biggest movie you have ever rejected? yeah enjoyed that. Do you use reddit generally? What are some toxic Bollywood standards that you would like to call out? I will have to say - Princess Yashodhara from VEER ! Because I've been a complete tomboy all my life , and playing a princess was like a complete 360 degree turn. Nepotism is common across many industries in India‚Ä¶ raw talent isn‚Äôt enough in many cases, sad as that may be.

How is Salman Khan really? Like real life behind the stage? And do you think nepotism is stymieing our ability to make good and meaningful movies and also music- not the cringe stuff that is being served currently? OR awe are just not able to make good and creative stuff (knowing fully well even movies like Sholay was copied and renowned music producer or the past copied shit straight - not ignoring the recent ones) OR is it something else Have you tried to work in any film industry in India other than Bollywood and Tamil/telegu? Hello, what's your take on casting couch and is it a real thing. Have you ever been approached to take on a role in consideration of other favours ? Hi Zareen, can we expect any projects in the near future Hi Zareen, big fan. Had a question for you. What‚Äôs your fondest memory or moment while filming? With whom you don't wanna work again? And why? ( specific name ) enjoyed that Scary Bhai Cosmetic surgeries for better aesthetics? Any? Hi Zareen If dostana 2 had a sex change, who'd you want opposite you? (#KWKseChuraya) Can you share your weight loss journey and how do you keep yourself so fit? Hi zareen, hope you are doing good. How bad is the scene of casting couch and sexual exploitation withing the industry? Is it prevalent among big production houses also? I really wished you would do good in Bollywood How bad was your accident in Goa? Hi zareen, I wanna know about the casting couch, if it exists. Hi ZK, if you could have just ONE super power, what would it be and why? Yeah it's almost uncanny Kadi which pawaya ayi? 360 degree actually takes to the same point. It means you‚Äôre at the exact same point as when you started . You probably mean 180 degrees. Hi, I don't think one has to force spirituality... its something that should come naturally . I see and know of a lot of people who burn candles and give long talks about spirituality but in their reality , they are far away from practising what they preach. I feel spirituality is about doing good deeds and being a good human irrespective of any race and religion. Hi Zareen!!! I had a huge crush on you as a 10 year old when I watched \"Veer\".

Kinda unrelated but does the industry not treat it's musicians well? I have thought about it for some time now. What music you listening nowadays? So I get to work with you if I lick your ass? Damnit, I'm in /s Have you ever had to say that? /s S for serious/sarcasm (a trick you can use to reveal the truth too) Did you like doing Jatt James Bond lmao? Welcome to Reddit, Are you active in movies or switched to entrepreneurship? How would you rate u r life before and after getting into movies? How bad is the casting couch for people from outside the industry? Your favourite all time movies? Hi Zareen! What has been the worst experience for you in Bollywood? Hi Zarine, i have had a massive crush on you since I've seen you on the big screens.

Aa gaye Gyan Dene Wale mahapurush Nah I don't have time to keep up with celebrity drama. But I'll take your word for it. Who do you look up to as an actor? Hi zareen. What's your favourite behind-the-scenes moment? Hi Zareen you have worked in multiple film industries what‚Äôs the unique thing about every industry Do you think Veer as your debut movie was the right choice? I'd reckon being with someone as popular as Salman Khan in the first movie is going to be difficult for a lot of reasons. Thanks! Zareen, how do you handle criticism on social media ? What‚Äôs your height? What r ur upcoming movies?? Hi Zareen, \\-I was legit vibing to \"character dheela\" song like 5 minutes ago! Me and my family always liked you as a female lead in all the flim we've watched in the past (when I was small). \\-I really wanted to ask you about your take on Bollywood movies being turned to a commercial angle with lesser effort and gradual increase between the age gaps of male and female lead in recent films? When will u debut in Hollywood?? she was actually trolled heavily for that, she said the online bullying she received for that was a traumatizing experience for her Hi zareen üßö How was your experience working in Punjabi industry? Which is the one thing you liked & disliked working there? Hey Zareen. How challenging was it for you to do Hate Story 3? How does it feel to be the most beautiful girl on the planet? Hi Zareen , honestly how do you feel industry impacted your mental health? Hi Zareen, Wanted to ask about what the biggest misconception about Bollywood is and what you think is the biggest problem with the current filming scene in India (in your opinion) Hi Zareen so any film you regret doing in your career?? Hi Zareen Ma'am, do bollywood actors, directors, writers... use reddit regularly. And do they read about themselves on subs related to Bollywood? What's your favorite Bollywood movie that you weren't a part of? Hello zareen 1) Which movie you most enjoyed while shooting ? 2) Who is most punctual co star ? 3) Fav movie name ? 4) Will you dare to speak about Manipur ? Tooooo many things .... few to mention - Taking flying lessons. Visiting the pyramids. Having a pet snake and a pet tiger. Seriously dude üòí Spitting faxxxxx!! lmao what!? I think she proved her individuality really well in houseful movie. In a good way. Hi Zareen, first off I wanna say, you are really pretty! My question: what has been your best and worst experience of working on a movie? As someone who had a different body type than what is expected from actors in bollywood did you find it challenging? I feel you are an inspiration to many who realise that being fit is more important than being skinny Hi Zareen, I just wanna say you look gorgeous and you're ageing like fine wine. Hoping to see more of you, best wishes! What's the reality of casting couch, have you ever faced something like that ? Hi Zareen, whats the idealistic character anyone from the history that you would like to play? Hi Zareen , How do you generally prepare for a role or a shot , do you have to get in a certain mindset for a particular role , people always talk about emotional scenes but how do you go about doing a romantic scene or a happy scene if you are feeling down. Cheers. How was she an outsider when she was literally known to Salman Khan‚Äôs family? Are you the one who took part in character deelah hai? You look like sister of Katrina kaif Hi zareen, what‚Äôre some crazy things people do to get attention in the industry? Bollywood often stereotypes, the way you were presented in Veer movie and then you break the stereotype by signing Hate Story 3. While we like you in both the films.... How hard would it be to you for saying yes to Hate Story 3? loved your film with karan kundra , and ur song sun le zara was beautiful indeed Always felt you have a lot of potential. Hope to see you in some individual projects soon. Good luck Zareen. ***Hello!*** u/zareenkhanofficial Hello zareen ma'am, How do you manage stress be it work or life? Also are u a chai person or coffee? Your fav actors (pan indian) That's not nepotism, that's cronyism. It's prevalent everywhere. Even the precious Nolan. Why is answering random redittors important to you? How was your experience working in Punjabi movies? Hi Zareen! Any unwanted gossip that you've been associated with, on which you've laughed out the loudest Hey, Do you think nepotism is making it hard for new talents to set foot in Bollywood? Were you always interested in acting? Does it come naturally to you, or did you take training? Do you think someone can become good at acting just by training? What are your top 5 favourite movies? What kind of movies you like to watch and what kind of movies you like to act in? I feel that you bear resemblance to Elnaaz Norouzi too and she's doing good in foreign films. So how about Hollywood! Also wouldn't it make a really confusing movie if all of you star in a movie that includes Mandana Karimi! ü§∑ Who are you? Not mean to sounding rude but i am literally hearing your name for the first time. What is your favourite character in films? I love my mom's cooked food the best more than any restaurants. But if I have to tell u options .... Less than rs100 - BUN MASKA & CHAI , SAMOSA , MAGGI (esp. in the mountains) Around 5000 - Don't have such an expensive taste .... I'm a simple person with simple but delicious taste buds üòÇ Do you remember coming to SRCC, Delhi University in the early 2010s for a fashion show? I was one of the organizers for that event Do you select movies because you want to continue acting or do you select movies because you genuinely like the script or the story ? What would you have been if not an actor? Can you imagine yourself doing anything other than acting? Maybe within the industry or something completely different? i remeber you were pretty popular. Just curious, where did you go? Why did you stop? What happened? Please suggest some skin care tips from Bollywood industry, especially any medicated products or supplements common in beauty industry? Do you watch Anime? I know it's a weird question!! Why did u leave the industry? How's your current life going ? Lodu bada aaya I don't have time. Lame ass troll. How do you go about finding new projects? What did you liked about bollywood that you joined it? Fuck off. Not everyone cares for \"celebrities\" How has life changed after being in movies? How has the industry changed over the years throughout your journey working as an actress ? Do you think ageism will remain a factor for actresses unlike their counterpart in the industry in future? Hello ma'am, I am a big fan of yours and seen your movies plenty times but I was thinking that you have so many connections in bollywood still you aren't able to get good movies so what's the reason Yeah so a 180. AWWW üòä Thank you for your love ... I know this might sound crazy esp. bcoz I'm an actress, but I don't really know to do my make up .... what I showed in the video , is what I've learnt in all these years üòÇ I don't really have one particular shade that's my fav ... I always mix 2-3 shades. But I use this liquid lipstick from MISS CLAIRE in peach pink quite often. But here you are, asking a \"celebrity\" a question. Replying to comments as soon as they hit your phone. And your taste in wrestlers is trash. Sad lame ass troll. Were you always wanted to be in film industry or something else? Zareen - you are absolutely stunning! My question - do you feel like you didn‚Äôt get the roles that you would have if you were related to someone in the industry ? Are there a lot of roles that you didn‚Äôt get an opportunity to work on? Since it is month of Muharram... What do you think about the sacrifices of the Husayn , Hassan and Ali? Even from an non-religious political perspective, I find this moment of early muslim history to be very sadful.... Hey! I have no questions. Was just reading your responses on this thread. Rooting for you! üéâ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è All the best, Zareen! Hi! Hope you are well. What is your opinion on the need for \"intimacy directors\" on the sets? Which are your favourite anime shows? If you watch any... Do you plan do any OTT projects or any projects outside of India? Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Thanks. I wanted to be a lot of things but an actress .... But look at the irony ! üòÇ Do you think the opportunities for women have gotten better in Bollywood over the years? What do you think can change in the industry? What sort of movies interest you to explore currently? Why are you not doing any movies these days ? Hi, Zareen. Hope you are doing good. How's Savlon Bhoi these days? How often do you lurk on reddit. I m certain there are only a few celebrities who even know about reddit. Mam what brought you to the reddit ? Surely enough you are famous on every other platform . I love your movie veer ; you played the role phenomenally .(‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè) Hi Zareen, I have been following your acting career since your debut, saw you in some punjabi movies as well. Can you tell me a negative point you had to go through there? and whats guilty.pleasesure in general? Do you play games , take a walk or something different? Hi Zareen, is your character dhila or tight? NO ... you are mistaken .... I don't really have a lot of connections in the industry and I also don't really know how to do small talks . Heyy!! How‚Äôs your work experience with daisy shah? Why don't you work in South Indian movies? Gyan galat nahi diya gaya hai You never fail to impress, that all i wish to say, impress with your beauty, talent and fitness. What do you think about bollywood underutilising you? Have you ever come face to face with katrina? If yes How was the interaction? Casting couch is real right ? Oh I see thank you for clarifying my doubt hope you stay safe and good I thought Salman Khan was your biggest connection The dynamics have definitely changed over the years ! I feel with OTT coming in , there is no more ageism or any other 'ism' üòÑ Thanks for answering >a pet tiger. Mike Tyson approves üëç You were my childhood crush YEAH..

And would you ever be willing be to act in a Hollywood film? hi zareen hope you see this comment your first film was with salman khan despite being an outsider, how difficult or easy it was for you to land into such a role ??? have you seen any type of change in the audience taste in last 12-13 years you have been in this industry ??? Hi have you ever felt paparazzi‚Äôs dark side ? Who is the actor with whom you want to become good friends in future and who is the actor you don‚Äôt ever wanna see again? Recently got a flight simulator and can totally understand the flying dream! Now a pet tiger otoh... Count me out sister. Am I answering this or AI ? ü§î What's wrong in it though? If you take it positively you learn something new and in a way upgrade yourself. Hi zareen, thank you for this ama. We don't see you much on the screen, do you go for auditions and screen tests even after being a known face like how they do in the west? Or do you look to pick out the best from what's coming towards you? Sun lo. If suppose, this is your last day on this earth toh what will be your biggest regret? P.S:- Gautam bhai ke joote kaise chori hone dediye aapne.XD. I wish you all the happiness ahead. what was ur percentage/CGPA in class 10th and 12th ? Downvote kyun kr rhe yaar usme. Aisa jaruri thodi hai sabko reply degi. Mujhe lga my question will be lost in the sea of so many questions. Itna rude kyun ho rhe, I was so happy she replied üòä you really didn't need to ruin this üòî Someone actually did post an AI generated images of her on my sub. Looks a bit like her.

And STILL you are here... Not meaning to sound rude üòú How does it feels to be popular and known? Specially when it was never planned or aspired? Bollywood has a serious nepotism issue as well, the two issues can coexist at once &#x200B; YES !!! Just recently I came across a video claiming that I've been murdered ü§£ Whats your perception of Life in general ? Hi Zareen, If I may ask, how real is the ignorance from the Main stream personalities in the Bollywood Fraternity true...?? For the newcomers. Your question could have been phrased so much better. Even after she replied to it, the least you could do was not be an absolute asshat about it. How deprived of attention and delusional are you that this is how you behave on an AMA? What a pathetic person. Where is your hometown and who introduced you to the industry Hi ...when can we see you back in a glam avatar...and on ott.. i loved the india tour series with jeep... Will we ever get to see you in a character like one in HATE STORY 3?. Among all this character is my fav one. Hey Zareen, I am quite curious how would a normal day look like for someone in entertainment industry?? Also, how do you spice up normal days ?? Maybe don't engage with celeb worshiping subs/posts then. My god the irony Any particular cuisine you crave for which you are ready to sort of budge from your fitness schedule? Ma'am, What kind of man is your man of dreams . üòä How many of these questions are asked by your pr team ? What do you think about the Bollywood industry now? Is there a change from when you started to now? Where do you think Bollywood is heading towards? Maybe she isn't into Hollywood? Lol celeb worship karte raho didi What's the most challenging thing you've had to overcome in your career? Do you mean literally?ü§î Hi Zareen What are 3 things in life that scare you the most ? Could be anything from animals/people/experiences ! What is your favorite role you've played so far? Why? I am pretty sure its not just the ass that is being licked Hi zareen, who is your best friend Tumko kya problem hai dadaji? I like her. She is very simple and down to earth as I have been noticing her since a long time. Tumhari kyun jal rahi. Dum hai toh khud celebrity bano. Imma ask you the real questions. What did you think happened to Jiah Khan and Sushant Singh? I personally think Bollywood is dying due to lack of originality and nepotism. The rise of movies from the south does help either. Have you ever done modelling?? If yes, then is it really glamorous as it looks from outside or is it something else ?? How is OTT changing Bollywood? What‚Äôs your opinion about OTTs in general? Is bhai as arrogant and obnoxious as people say he is ? Very ! bcoz I never in my life thought I'd do something like this ... but there was a time in life when there wasn't any work coming in and I had to take care of my family .... so I did the film. I have no regrets now .... bcoz when I see what's happening in films and OTT now ... it is much more . This was the wrong sub Zarine. You should have done an ama on r/Bollywood and r/Bollyblindsandgossip Your PR people üòÇ What is your hobby? > A** licker Literally? Hii zareen jii I saw your film 1921.I want to ask you if you ever experienced paranormal activity in your life i read that zaheer khan at first lol Tum banjao itna pasand hai celeberity banane wannabe insta influencer ü§° hi zareen! what are some of your favourite movies? Has reddit finally gone mainstream in India? I don't even want to engage in any further conversation as you are clearly a happiness sucking cheap vampire. Go spread sadness. üòÑüòÑ You are so beautiful, how do you maintain it? Also how do u deal with self doubt? Oof tricky response. Since, you know, casting couch is a thing. Have you watched jojo‚Äôs bizzare adventures? Hi Zareen, I am curious, what did you want to become when you were a kid? Pragmatic baat bolne se I am spreading sadness lol get out of your dream world Hey Who is tour favorite actor in bollywood? Hi Zareen, first of all, you are one of the most beautiful people I have ever seen on screen. I have yet to see you off screen. I love you in comedy roles. Hope you do more comedy films. **My question is :** Have you ever faced a situation where you almost good a good movie but then at the end some other actress was cast because of nepotism and/or because she had more Bollywood connections? If yes, which movie was it? Hy Im always late fckkkkkkkkkkkkk Well that‚Äôs impossible for meüòù Hi Zareen Will we see you in OTT's ? Hey. Was reading through your replies and I never really expected you to be so insightful . Which intrigues me to hear your thoughts on the current situation of Bollywood in terms of box office collections. We‚Äôre witnessing a rampant increase in nationwide collections for Hollywood and even South Indian movies while Bollywood movies are still a hit or miss. Where do you think all of this stems from and will we see a possible change in these trends soon? Hey Zareen! How do you feel about the communalism happening in India? Do you feel Bollywood, as a channel reaching to quite remote parts of India, should have a responsibility to educate or instill a feeling that humanity is what will take us forward both economically and societally? Is it possible for like minded artists in bollywood to strive towards this? Hello zareen i am mirza from Pakistan i have question regarding your movies which movie shoot you facing a prblm and accident and you feel sad Hello ma'am \"Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated\" You guys know na, ke PR guys are answering the questions and not actually Zareen. Tu meri dost hai... I don't understand this obsession even my friends have to eat the same stuff in mountains on the way maybe i am odd one out Well idk if I like how civilised this comment section is, I guess people are lot more strict/anti fun on internet these days. But if this post was done during 2010 internet vibes then the comments would be interesting and not sounding so scripted. Anyway, didn‚Äôt know itne hot log bhi Reddit chalate haiüòù Lol Do you know anyone in bollywood who has never had a plastic surgery? How many have you had? You were fabulous and graceful in Veer. Made you my childhood crush ü•π. Are you still there? üòí I want to know which is your favorite indoor plants at home? \\> look at the irony !

Hi Zareen,the last heard about was about you walking out of a film because the producers were forcing you for more intimate scenes..I just want to say kudos to you..I felt proud of you that day and I‚Äôm getting a chance to say this to you jn person. Haan, tujhe kaise pata chala? Childhood crush man, used to wait for Surili Akhiyo waale and Salaam aaya to come on tv. I was like 7 Can you describe some funny incident while shooting ? Are you happy with the compensation you get in Bollywood ? Do you think there are other professions where people are getting paid way more. Do you have a suggestion for people who need to maintain a finance for running a home while pursuing acting ? When Did Nolan do it ? Thanks for doing this AMA Zareen. You answered a lot of questions and seem so kind and genuine. My question is, how has your interaction been with other Bollywood celebrities? Did you feel like they‚Äôre normal people you can enjoy hanging out with or did you feel a disconnect due to their privileged background in Bollywood families? Translation? Would you be interested in doing south Indian movies (Malayalam or Tamil)? People like you think by being an asshole to everyone, especially a girl, they are being badass. Lol, delusional much? Seems fake but okay Holy shit that is dark. Hi Zareen. Who is your favorite actor in Bollywood in terms of acting abilities? First time i read as Zaheer Khan lol I won't be able to do it correctly but the gist is, \"Do you slice your banana before eating or just deep throat it. /s\" Your presentation on Mahi ve remake was awesome! You remind me of my ex wife, lol. Ngl you were my childhood crush ü•∞ So you read that story. Tu hi to meri dost hai üéàü•∞‚ô•Ô∏è Hi zareen..........I want to see u again in ROMCOM. Is this possible? If you are really being honest Tell us about the casting couch and name some shady directors who want to take advantage of a woman in Bollywood. I am pretty sure you won‚Äôt answer this !!! Yea when?? HOW DO I SEND YOU GIFTS? HOW DO I CONTACT YOU? If all the marketing tactics and audience projection shenanigans were not an issue, what kind of movies would you like to try? Like Bollywood is known for a certain genre of movies which are a bit, I don't know how to put it, extra cheesy to appease the masses. But I guess actors themselves would've their own ambitions about, \"Oh I wish I could do an Indian version of Incetion (or Barbie based on the taste, lol).\" Do you have any of these Khayali Pulao like most of us do? Us bhai us \"Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world.\" My Cocaine is your answer. Try saying that in a Cockney accent Damn! Reddit is getting mainstream. Stop clout chasing here man, get out. Let reddit be. Go back to Insta or twitter or whatever. can i get ur phone number?üôÉ need to do a quick proposal.. I just said she will reply to you because it's ama and you think I am trolling you for saying truth and boom out of nowhere using gender card lol get a grip üòÇ I would love to see you playing something like Yashodhara from VEER again sometime when you need to mention movie names for recognition Loving your responses. not at all, it's a reference to the question Akshay Kumar asked Narendra Modi, he didn't mean it in a vulgar way Hi Zareen any updates on your upcoming projects and also do you intend to branch out into other spectrums of the industry apart from acting are you real zarin khan? You are literally trolling me because I post on Instagram (you said influencer in a mocking way) and also people like you have no other work than bringing people down. Consider thinking \"why I hate people so much who I have no business with\" Goodluck with your hate campaign. Hi zareen, you are one of the most beautiful heroines I have seen in Hindi cinema. Why don't you branch out to South and act in South Indian movies? Money maybe slightly less but they are very professional and movie shooting finishes in 6 months. I think it will add more value and help you strengthen your presence in the Indian film industry. BTW again you are very beautiful üòâ > I don't even want to engage in any further conversation as you are clearly a happiness sucking cheap vampire. Still you are engaging with meüòÇ and yourself trolling me and cussing me shows what a hypocrite you're, lol I have not even cussed or abused you anywhere but you are doing it and on top of it playing gender card, good for you.. Do you find it challenging to detach from a character after completing a project, particularly if it was emotionally demanding? Why you joining reddit? Worst people to collaborate with with Are you done? üò¥ Because I clearly am. I am sorry you don't have anything substantial to do todayü•¥ Hi Zareen, hope you're doing great! I'm really loving your honest answers. Just curious but what profession would you have rather chosen if it were not to be an actress? Han gali do khud aur jab point out karu toh are you done boldo ok üòÇü§° Hello Zareen, I am struggling to lose weight and your journey is very inspiring. Any tips you have is appreciated. Also really admire that you did not play the stereotypical stick thin heroine in your movies. Many of us struggle with weight issues and it‚Äôs good to see normal women on screen. Nice work by you ma'am. I like your role very much in Veer and Housefull 2 and others movies also. How do you feel about the influence you got after entering the Bollywood vs before Bollywood. I'm sure life is changing but how are you coping up with the changes of not being as active as before? With writers strike happening in the US as of now, could you shed light on how the Indian film industry views on unionization and do they receive the benefits done by the All Indian Cine Workers Association? Are people even aware of their own rights in the industry? Surili akhiyon wale, be my friend lolz Hi Zareen, What are your thoughts on current tide of entertainment industry (especially wrt OTT) Hi zareen, Why did you become an actor ? Was it your childhood dream? My sincere apologies in that case I hate reddit becoming mainstream smh. Let's hope ban na ho jae ya koe kand na nikle idhar se What made u log into reddit? Is it true that Bollywood only favors giving jobs to only light-skinned indians or indians that are 5'9 and above for both males and females alike? Any chance we can see you doing de-glam roles? Hello Zareen...This is all I wanted to say. Have a nice day. > esp. if you aren't an A** licker ! Damn ! You know, funny enough, Hollywood is the only industry that doesn't outsource it's jobs when hiring actors in places like India and china and stuff. They only hire those that are mostly within the States already, how ironic is that lol. How are you aging backwards? Hi zareen, hope you are doing well. There are ups and downs in everyone‚Äôs life, what do you do to keep yourself motivated and get through the bad times life throws at us? I just love your work; I adore your motivation and I so wish you get more to prove your potential; Looking forward to seeing you more.. Best Wishes, Tons of Love.. Rock on beautiful!! How did you get such huge boobs??Is there any chance that I may get to see and touch them?? What are your views on Salman khan? Hey. Zareen I really love a girl. How should I tell her. Any advice Hi Zareen ! How long did you have to practice for Lagdi Lahore Di aa dance with Melvin Louis ? Amazing moves !! if given an option which role of forgotten woman fighters? which one you would prefer to play and why? 1. Razia Sultana 2. Begum Hazrat Mahal 3. Bi Amma 4.

I strive for the same healthy mindset ü§çüí´ 360 is actually right ‚Ä¶the circle meets itself at the other end,.. its the journey to meet the new her is what she meant by 360 what is your opinion on nepotism in bollywood? Man‚Ä¶ you just opened my eyes.. maybe Akshay was really asking that. üåüWhat would be your take on how to obtain a successful acting career? üåüAlso is it challenging to get roles in movies? üåüHow to recover from public mistakes such as unknowingly put up political statement or something related to public being furious to you for ur statements. üåüDoes Instagram create opportunity for acting career? Did you watch Oppenheimer? Why does bollywood not make historical films which are actually accurate and cared for. Hi Zareen, which outsider/non-star kids do you admire?(Name a few). Hi Zareen. How r u??. And what are you up to nowadays?? I asked a question I don't know whether you seen or not,here i am asking again. Have you thought that hate story 2 will give a big push or did you know the movie state while it was in shooting stage? Few actors/actress openly confessed when they know they are acting in a bad/flop movie. Is there any movie you thought while shooting it is going flop? No hard feelings here, but you didn't get movies because you can't act! Period! How does bhai drive car would have been a better question Why all 3 movies socks? Pets or zoo ? Hey zareen, you haven't worked in movies for some time.. any particular reason for that? Hey Zareen, I have no questions to ask, but I love your acting and like you a lot. Stay the same, more love and joy to you HI ZAREEN , I AM VIJAY . I ADMIRE YOUR WORK A LOT , I FIRST SAW YOU IN YOUR MOVIE VEER AND IMMEDIATELY FELL FOR YOUR LOOKS AND THEN I LOOKED FORWARD ON MORE FILMS OF YOURS . ACTUALLY I AM FROM IIT BOMBAY AND HERE I HAVE MORE PROBABILITY OF MEETING A CELEBRITY LIKE LAST TIME I SAW VICKY KAUSHAL IN PAWAI. IT'S MY DREAM TO MEET WITH YOU . HOW CAN I MEET YOU? THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY It depends on the location. You really don't want to experiment with your stomach when you are hiking up. If that's not an issue, eat whatever you want. Waiting for you to come back with a bang! So are you going to make a comeback anytime soon?? How to maintain consistency with discipline üòÄ e.g.it may be diet, healthy habits or any habits which helps us to grow....how you maintained it.... Well I fear my stomach always but i cannot understand people craving for this stuff just on mountains so that's why I thought Reddit moment ü§ìü§ì Tigers and Snakes are not pets. Stick to domesticated animals for that. Keep wildlife in the little remaining wild areas. However, if you are interested still, you can adopt a tiger or snake in some Indian zoo or fund some animal rescue center or orphanage. They may let you tend the animals during their routine treatments etc. Sorry to sound pretentious. But please. What is your take on nepotism in the Bollywood industry ? Doesn't it make you angry to see that a talented and beautiful actress like yourself not get as much opportunities as other star kids ? How do you address body shaming and other stuff that goes around the media? Hi zareen ji loved ur all honest replies. I would like to suggest u that suppose if ur not getting roles which u want then You can switch to TV industry to showcase ur talent. One of the best thing I like about u is that to get roles in film You didn't compromise with ur values‚ù§üëè Appreciate your honest replies.

Btw i have a pharma company and would like to work with you for ad shoots. So what‚Äôs the good place to discuss for that stuff? Hii zareen ! Can you describe a hobby or interest that you have outside of your work and public persona? I absolutely love your song surili akhiyon wale . When it came out ,i was little girl. I used to think u were an indian disney princess üíó üå∏ üíó Favourite Cricketer?? Whats your fav movie of all time and why ? Hello.. a fan here.. What‚Äôs your goto cheat meal?

No one is nalla like you nihil Hi Zareen, what do you feel about guys masturbating to you Do you get envious? If so, how do you overcome it? I am at a point of this journey where it is difficult for me to overcome envy nature of mine. Its so tough. Lmao the comments under priyanka‚Äôs ama are brutal Hii Zareen. Do you speak Marathi ? Hi what's your next project Wow! You're truly an inspiring actress, Zareen. I've watched many of your films, and truly enjoy the themes and stories you bring to the screen. Hi Zareen, I have always wanted to confirm one thing. In 2010 when I was in school, one of the school kid (i forgot his name) claimed to be your cousin. He was 4th grader that year and was from Rajasthan. The school was Dawn Academy in Panchgani. Can you confirm this for me please? Do you feel weird when you go in public and to your surprise nobody recognizes you? Hi, which musician are you listening to the most these days? What's going on? we can now communite with celebrities? That's crazy Hi Zareen, Any question or comment that makes you feel ashamed Hehe good one zareen üòÇ Hi Zareen! Big fan of your work! How has your experience working in the industry been and what part of the craft do you feel like you need to work on the most, as an actor? How was your actual experience working with salman khan? Did you ever go driving with bhoi? Damn! Thanks. Have you ever faced sexual harassment from Bollywood people? You got the grace , deserve a slb movie As far as i know these things also happened earlier Ma'am do you know pashtun or pashto language how you are connected to it ? Influencerr ?? She was always an actor Do actors sleep around with each other? My Cocaine is an incredible actor, his characters always have depth to them. My Weed on the other hand... We can definitely cut some angles first tho What is your name, and what movies have you starred in? Billo Bagge Billeyan Da Ki Karegi? Bagge Bagge Billeyan Da Ki Karegi? Hey Zareen, i have no questions, just wanted to say that cant wait for your next movie. Its been 2 years since hum bhi akele tum bhi akele release and that was a really nice movie, excited for the upcoming stuff. Do you think you have been typecasted in Bollywood and how keen are directors/producers in general to give someone a role different from the typecast in today's landscape? You remind me of Lana Del Rey a bit. Sending likes of love for your future projects! üôå Session khtm ho gya kya? You mean two right angles?? How do you respond to creeps and perverts on social media? Has anyone ever told you you look a lot like Alexandra Dadario? Very hard if your name is not Alia. I eat at cheap places, so Chai, samosa, maggi etc are all < ‚Çπ50 stuff for me. If someone asked me about around ‚Çπ100, I'd be more likely to say Pav Bhaji, Chole Bhature etc. I'm probably never gonna buy any single dish for ‚Çπ5000 though, so same answer as Zareen. Ghapa ghap tak tha uska saath bas Hi zareen how are you so much hot and beautiful are you human ??? Tell me about the things or questions about life or your career that make you anxious...and also what you do when you feel quite low (something that cheers u up)..?? She‚Äôs not from a film family though Hi Zareen, I just wanted to say hi. Hi Zareen, are you a door? Did Salman fuck you ? Haha I was wondering why no one is asking her the obvious question Yes but she would not have answered that question üíÄ Probably because it's default to arrange visas. When the movies are shot in India, they will hire Indian actors. Eg: Extraction Cillian Murphy has been working with Christopher Nolan since batman begins and has been in almost all of his films ever since do you pray namaz? since women are ordered to cover themselves, how do u feel having your uncovered body displayed to so many people? Are you not afraid of jahannam? Hey Zareen, any advice for a 20 year old. Also lots and lots of love to you. Just look how rude people were and how they downvoted her every comment. No wonder celebs stayed away You were In Ready ? Having a big cat as a pet is illegal and saying this as a huge cat lover. Ain‚Äôt matter. If a superstar knows you well and giving you a break then that does count in nepo. Hey zareen i have seen your jatt james bond in my childhood its my face character for you. How was your experience in Punjabi industry Omg how do you have links Are you nude now? One min silence to all those who thought it's actually her lol Nomiesü§° bhi reddit pe ane lage, ab reddit chhordna hoga But she wasn't nearly as successful as katrina (no hate to her ofc) so bhai failed at it, didn't he. It wasn't just her looks that made katrina famous. She had charisma and an it factor. Also she is a really good dancer. So salmonella's whole \"I'm so powerful that i can launch another woman who looks like you because you're THAT replaceable\" schtick failed miserably. If you are coming to lucknow I would love to help you explore the city Hi Zareen, what's the thing that you love to do in your free time? Hi zareen, I have seen u in person during a Aldo major brand retail opening at phoenix market city and was in awe with ur skin. Just a question ? Are u really answering all queries urself ? If yes how do u address all What do you hate the most about Bollywood or noticed that \"this is happening and if it wasn't done, the quality of films could've been at a different level\"? S If you had to choose one Bollywood movie for an American who has no idea, where would you recommend I start? i.e. not overly stylized, good subtitles/dubbing, relatable story, etc Hi Zareen Khan! So far I haven't seen any big celebrities create an official account on reddit you did it!!. Kudos to you for also answering all the questions posted here. I'm happy to see this side of yours. Also who is your favorite bollywood celebrity (Male/Female)? Dave Shutton -- Springfield Daily Shopper. Who are you? Where are you going? Time to claim the term insurance in keep the money in the safe Ever heard of Rajpal Yadav... Any amazing memory with Salman Bhai, ma'am? Why pet snakes and tigers? Figuratively speaking....i hope... will the pet snake be named nagraaj Who is answering these questions? I don't think you are I hope this becomes a trend, Indian celebrities doing AMAs I didn't know zareen Khan uses reddit üòÆ Hi Zareen, You debuted and started off in 2010 if my memory serves, back when mainstream cinema and probably Television were the the only viable options to be a part of the show business. Now with the advent of OTT, there is a plethora of opportunities and a level playing to include talents across all levels. What would be your dream project given the plethora of opportunities we have today to make your mark as an artist with your audience? How easy or difficult is it to stay relevant in this age of 24*7 internet connectivity? How is Bhai in real life? Personally gaming come in waves I may go months without but other time I‚Äôll find one so good I just sink my life into it, don‚Äôt feel bad for loving something as long as it doesn‚Äôt effect your responsibilities Tell me your darkest phase of ur journey you fased Do gangs influence casting/other decision making in Bollywood? Haan dikha diya ki tu genius hai. Khush? Chut*iya saala Imagine the synchronicity! I was just thinking about you today and what have you been upto! Good to see you are doing alright. How much would could a wouldchuck chuck if a wouldchuck could chuck would? Good point. I didn't even think this through tbh. My favorite. But the shorter they are, I get the sense that these ppl get perm type casted unfortunately. Idk. for a moment I thought it was the cricket wala zaheer khan and got excited üò≠ Hii zareen, How did you started your career and when you thought about acting. Since you are not from filmy background then what kind of problem you faced in your early life before the industry One of the beautiful actresses in the world Indeed!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Does Salman bhai choreograph his songs on his own? Hi zareen . Keep up the good work Itni gandi movies me role karke apko kaisa laga Hi Zareen Are you related to Zarine, Sanjay khan s wife? Arey gyani chodu Hey Zareen, just wanted to say that I have the biggest crush on you, ever since I saw you as a kid in Veer. Since then I've been madly in love with you, and I loved your performance in housefull 2. You'll always be my one and only favourite actress!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Bhoi of bollywood After you became a star, how difficult was it you to make friends or personal connections? How were you able to see through individuals who tried to part of your life for the sole reason that you were a star and not you as an individual? I think PR Teams should leave Reddit alone and not try to turn it into Instagram which it never will. Lol. Haath Jodta Hu You have Best Lips in Industry don't screw their Natural Beauty like others have . It was identified as a PR activity and treated as such by the audience (fellow redditors) last time i saw you was in Jspm pune, this was before covid, you looked stunning. even cbum has strechmarks, those are medals of hard work. What were your qualifications like in study, if you don't mind telling me I think you have not fully utilised or explored the industry, you should have been working in more movies or OTT series. Are you very selective or is it because of lack of opportunities ? Such straightforward and honest replies ü§£ Beerbiceps asli I'd se aao. A fellow forrest gumper.. üòõ I have fapped to you many times. I hope you didn't mind. How do you think she got the roles Took it like a pro Hey zareen as you're a Muslim if it's not a personal one can you tell me are you a practicing muslim? If it's personal you can choose to skip . Apart from the I am girl from Pakistan I really love your bold looks and pretty smile love from Pakistan Have you ever thought working in Pakistan?? Are you still obsessed with shahid afridi? Do you listen to Pakistani music and do you listen to these tendy punjabi music of sidhu ap and shubh How director got fund for movies? Can we become a assistant to main director in short year (5 year) Hello, you look stunning. Have you ever considered trying your luck in Tollywood? When would we see you again on the big screen? We dying to see you again. Ever wondered if you were in Hollywood?? Man that Imran Khan AMA looks so fun! Dude seems like a genuinely nice guy to be around. Real id se aao Ranveer Allahabadia Do everybody do drugs in Bollywood ? Is it necessary to reach that stage ? Have you been offered? Do these top actors and actresses in the industry also do it ? Without mentioning the name can you please tell us about it Hi maam, in one of the reply you said you were like tom boy, Im kinda same but some times I do want to look good , so what should be the dress style and simple makeup thing which won't bother my comfort much. ü§ì and still make me look pretty I used to think that you are a sibling to Katrina Kaif for a really long time. It would be great if we could hear about your journey in the film industry. I mean she is she at the end right. Just she took whole new turn is not like she changed or something. So yeah I guess 360 is pretty valid r/Kerala users, you guys pressing X on this given what happened last month? I have question. If you had an superpower what would it be? Regards. How did you end up working in so many Tamil movies as well? Just wanna ask is the casting coach real or fake. Hello Zareen Khan, I have been a big fan of yours since your movie \"Veer.\" I fell head over heels for you back then and have loved you ever since. However, I noticed that your last film was \"Housefull 2\" in 2017, and I wonder why you left Bollywood. I sincerely hope that you consider making a comeback, especially through OTT platforms, as they are the next big thing in the entertainment industry. With OTT, you can collaborate with pioneers like TVF, TSP, SonyLiv, Netflix, etc., and reach a wider audience. Your fans, including myself, would be thrilled to see you back on the screen. Please do let us know the reason behind your departure from Bollywood. We miss you and love you, Zareen, and eagerly await your return. damn rarely have I seen any actor's account on reddit Will you marry with your boy friend??

Hi Zareen, I am big fan of yours and i follow you on Instagram and Reddit I saw Your All Movies i tell you true from my thinking you are more beautiful than Katrina Hi Miss Zareen . I just randomly watched Hate Story 3 during free time and I must say it is an amazing film. Great story and great cast too especially karan singh grover and your performance. You looked really beautiful and i loved your outfits especially that pink flower kind of outfit which you wore during the scene where you congratulated Sharman Joshi and his brother. The songs were my favourite part too especially wajah tum ho song. My rating for the film - ( 4 / 5 ). Worth rewatching I would just like to ask did you enjoy watching the film hate story 3 and how much would you rate it? would you say that it is one of the best films in your career (noting that you did hum bhi akele tum bhi akele which was so good). Omg and i hope you are making a comeback Hi zarine , let me be true to you, u ve been the most desirable girl for me and i like you as a human too, I'm just here to tell that there are a lot of men like me who would like to see more of you.
