    "selftext": "I know there are many fake reviews in amazon already, but this needs to be known because this concerns health directly.  \n  \nHas anyone used Carbamide Forte's products?\n\nI've observed two product (Vit D3 + B2 gummys and their multivitamin product) to have so many AI-generated/fake reviews, please check the attached screenshots for examples:\n\n[GPT Zero's opinion](https://preview.redd.it/hwelhmrr64od1.png?width=1737&format=png&auto=webp&s=51ebec268c42e044ece0aa9d5791115fb1ef7539)\n\n[GPT Zero's opinion](https://preview.redd.it/t2uynuor64od1.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e7503f053d5c28cc85a44732f6a3f6c81b4979)\n\n[These reviews look fake af.

But that is fine by me, at most that is just money wasted. I'm just worried (if they are behind this) if they follow poor manufacturing practices (and wouldn't care about fixing it if their business practices are this scummy). Did anyone had any negative effects from using their products?\n\n>! I hope I don't get assassinated xD!<",

I have not been consistent with it!Â \n\nI got their collagen powder & pills ( 2 different products)\n\nI am highly disappointed and shocked!\n\n1. Collagen powder!!\nHorrible taste & felt like I was drinking a sweet shampoo! Unimaginable amount of artificial sweetener! Immediately I got throat infection.. bad throat and cough for 3 days! I took a break from it! And tried again! Same thing happened\n\n\n2. Pills\nI thought may be the sweetener in powder was reacting with my throat and had hope with these pills!\n\nWith in ten min of taking the pill, I got skin irritation within 10 min!Whole body started itching! And very bad head aches and nausea and joint pains & Â fatigue!!! Urine smelling like sweetener! And alll these last for 6 hours!Â \n\nI took this pill for 3 times and same symptoms all the time!\nÂ \nI am not usually sensitive person at all!! I never get head aches, allergies, throat infections! Usually happens once in many years!!Â \n\nWtfffff I never expect these supplements to work! What on the earth they are mixing which makes an immediate reaction in 10 min!!?!!!!!!\n\nOmg this scared the Ffff out of me!Â \nRight now I took this pill 30 min back !my face & body itching very badly! Â Horrible head aches!\n\nDid anyone else felt the same??",
