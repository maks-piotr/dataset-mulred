        "Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has always underlined his crackdown on crime as a key imperative of his governance. To that effect, police encounters and bulldozing of properties of alleged criminals have become the visible symbols of a tough government bent on making Uttar Pradesh “apradh mukt” or crime-free.\nAn investigation of police records by The Indian Express reveals that since March 2017, when Yogi Adityanath took charge, and till date, the state has witnessed 186 encounters. This works out to more than one alleged criminal being killed by the police every 15 days.\nIn these six years, when it comes to police firing to injure (usually in the leg), the number goes up to 5,046 — more than 30 alleged criminals being shot at and injured every 15 days.\nIn the list of 186 killed in police encounters, records show, as many as 96 alleged criminals faced murder cases, two of whom faced cases of molestation and gangrape, and POCSO.\nPolice officials point out that between 2016 and 2022, there has been a sharp dip across the board in crime: 82% drop in dacoity and a 37% drop in murder, as per official records.\nBut few are linking this to encounters. In fact, when asked about these findings, Prashant Kumar, Special DG, Crime and Law & Order, Uttar Pradesh Police (see interview) told The Indian Express: “Police encounters have never been a part of our strategy to control heinous crimes or keep a check on hardened criminals.”\n\nRecords show that most of the encounter deaths go, effectively, unquestioned and unchallenged.\n\nA magisterial inquiry – the mandatory process in every police encounter that results in death – in as many as 161 encounters has been completed and disposed of with no objections raised by anyone, according to records.\n\nSignificantly, in a magisterial inquiry, the magistrate is required to record the statement of the policemen involved in action and any other people who want to testify, and submit the report with their own findings. In none of the 161 cases (25 still pending), were any adverse comments mentioned in the magisterial inquiry report.\n\nAnother procedural activity after each encounter relates to lodging of a case against the criminal (s) killed by the police and filing of a closure report in the court. Official records show that the police have filed closure reports in 156 of the 186 encounters. The respective courts have accepted these in 141 cases so far; 15 are pending. In the remaining 30 cases, the police investigation is pending, according to the records.\n\nThe scrutiny of encounter data shows that almost a third of these or 65 alleged criminals were shot and killed by the police in districts under Meerut zone. The Varanasi and Agra zones accounted for 20 and 14, respectively.\n\nIn ‘Operation Langda’ (in which an alleged criminal is shot in the leg and injured), the records show that between March 2017 and April 2023, as many as 5,046 criminals were shot in their legs during the encounter. Here again, Meerut zone topped the list with 1,752 wanted accused getting injured due to police firing.\nWhen asked why Meerut dominated these lists, Prashant Kumar, Special DG, Crime and Law & Order, Uttar Pradesh Police (see interview) told The Indian Express, “West UP has been traditionally crime prone.”\nDuring this six-year period – March 2017 to April 2023, as many as 13 policemen were killed in exchange of fire in the state, and another 1,443 injured. One of 13 policemen killed, and as many as 405 of the policemen hurt are from Meerut zone, according to the records.\n\nThe first criminal shot dead after Yogi Adityanath took charge as UP Chief Minister was on March 31, 2017. Identified as Gurmeet, he was a resident of Nandanpur village in Nangal police station area of Saharanpur, and killed in exchange of fire. The latest police encounter was on May 14 in which two men, Umesh Chandra alias Kallu, 27, and Ramesh, 40, wanted for the murder of police constable Bhedjeet Singh were killed in Jalaun under Kanpur zone. Police said Singh was allegedly killed on May 9 when he was chasing the two.",

        "An interesting analysis of these encounters on [The Print](https://theprint.in/opinion/yogi-adityanath-said-gunda-raj-over-and-people-bought-it-but-up-crime-still-the-worst/455360/).\n\n> The framing of crime coverage plays a crucial role. When the Samajwadi Party (SP) was in power, every crime committed was framed as a systematic outcome of government policy, of patronising criminals or ‘gunda raj’. Now, every crime is framed as an isolated incident that has taken place despite the Adityanath government’s policies about police encounters and zero tolerance for criminals. \n\n> According to Lucia Michelutti, an expert on Mafias in South Asia, Yogi Adityanath represents merely a reconfiguration of the mafia regime. In her book, The Wild East: Criminal Political Economies in South Asia, she explains how under the SP government, the ‘mafia raj’ was “competitive”. Whereas under the Yogi government, the mafia raj is ‘monopolistic’ — a centralised and authoritarian form of racketeering. The political economy remains the same. “The ‘mafia raj’ is still alive and is now camouflaging itself under saffron scarfs. The masquerade allows key players to keep breaking the law and maintain immunity, much in the same manner as the SP supporters did for the previous five years,” Michelutti writes.\n\n> The book presents evidence from Michelutti’s fieldwork in Janganpura where “the key Thakur and Jat bosses have now conveniently joined the BJP.” \n\n> much like the Modi government has owned the issue of national security despite a poor performance..., the Yogi government has owned the issue of law and order despite performing just as poorly. The mechanisms of both are essentially the same — shaping media discourse through buzzwords, symbolic actions (‘surgical strikes’, ‘police encounters’) and uncompromising rhetoric, in the place of any meaningful strategy. This has made both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath appear to be ‘tough’ leaders in terms of policies on security in the eyes of the public. And in politics, perception is everything.",
        "Very interesting analysis. But many of my friends in up say that they experience less crime these days. Whoever I talk to says the same. Is that due to the propaganda fed to them or reality or a mix of both. That's the question.\nOfficial numbers given by police are also showing decreased crime.But if what the article is saying is true , the numbers are possibly not true at all.",
        "Bhakt nahi manege",
        "I hate this trend of encounter justice, but I've lived there for a long time and we can't get rid of all goons, there'd be too big a power vacuum\n\n I prefer the saffron goons to the goons who were there before.",
        "Haha why do you prefer the saffron goons tho? I'm sure they don't do the crime in any kind of dharmic way.",
        "Lol a journalist from The Print went inside a police station once, she questioned them about allegations of killing only Muslims and they had a record of all the gangsters they'd encountered- he used that to prove \" Look we encounter people of all castes\"",
        "I have lived in West UP. And yes, I concur with your friends. The crime rates have dropped and the number of crime and rape reports have increased in the past few years, now there is 2 ways to look at this: Either the numbers have increased or the reports have increased to a safer environment. But from a personal experience, we see police vans taking rounds around the city even at midnight; and people are not scared to step outdoors even at 10 or 11, which wasn’t okay a few years ago.",
        "Yeah that's what everybody tells me!",
        ">I prefer the saffron goons to the goons who were there before.\n\nUntil they target you to get your land and paint you as a drug peddler.",

        "Well encounters have been successful in Mumbai and in Punjab in 90s. If the crime is entrenched, a few years of encounters does seem to have a positive impact on reducing the crime.",
        "I don't approve, but I understand.",
        "Our Maharaj is trying to implement population control in UP. Look at how all these andolan-jeevis are trying to defame him !!!",
        "Who's deciding that these are actual criminals? What makes police the judge?",
        "Well the police judged in Mumbai and Punjab and it eliminated gang violence and terrorism in those places. You might not like it, but put it to vote and most people would vote in favor of it on both sides of the political divide. It is what it is.",
        "Nah I remember what UP was prior to Yogi. How many broad daylight crimes used to happen. Crimes happen now as well. But it's a less worse option to the SAPA Raj."
