    "selftext": "I am beyond frustrated with the constant danger of cows on our roads. Despite paying tolls, these roads are littered with cattle, and it’s not just the national highways—it’s every fucking road in this country.\n\nJust today, I hit a cow on a toll road, which shattered my mirror. But that’s not even the worst of it. A few days ago, in my hometown, I hit a black cow while riding my Activa. The cow was barely visible due to poor lighting on the road, and it suddenly appeared in front of me, leaving me no time to react. This isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a serious safety hazard.\n\nWhat’s even more infuriating is the hypocrisy surrounding this issue. If you so much as touch these cows, you’re immediately at fault. Then, you have these self-proclaimed ‘Hindu Rakshaks’ and ‘Gau Rakshaks’ ready to pounce on you, all while the real question is ignored: Why the fuck do people leave these cows out in the open on roads?\n\nWhy do we pay tolls if the roads aren’t safe? Why are we tolerating this negligence on every road, from highways to city streets? The authorities, from the NHAI to local governments, are utterly failing us. Enough is enough. It’s time the government takes real action to address this issue before more lives are endangered.",
