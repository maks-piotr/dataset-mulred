I have no words for this. My hands feel a little shaky and my legs slightly numb as a type this. Is this where we're going? Everyday I see a new (and many-a-times false) case filed against someone's boyfriend / ex-boyfriend / husband / ex-husband, and the accusers get away with this as easily as breathing. I hope there is something we can do, some petition of sorts? This man, if not brought to justice, will stand as \"motivation\" for further exploitations and false cases to happen.\n\nI sincerely hope he gets the justice he deserves. Rest in peace, Atul. We can't blame you for leaving this cruel world.",

        "there is nothing to be shocked about , the thing is that this news got highlighted and just see the amount of married men suicide",

        "most people dont know about this too",
        "I will be honest men life doesn't matter in front of our judicial system",
        "Exactly why I made this post.",
        "I can assure you that this won't be picked up by mainstream media, just because it doesn't have the \"typical\" victim. Like vile and evil people have some particular gender. I hope his death wasn't in vain but deep down I know nothing will change. Our death doesn't matter....just another percentage or statistic",
        "Some men don't deserve life, but the measures taken to punish them are being misused by such cruel people. In the end, they often turn out to be much worse than the type of man for whom such measures were made in the first place.\n\n(I tried to word it properly, but it's a bit confusing, sorry! I hope you understood what I'm saying.)",

        "Thats sad",
        "The hour long video and his elaborative suicide letter is gut wrenching. Judiciary in our country is a fuckin joke, forget about rights there is not an iota of humanity in these people at power. And those evil scumbags who misuse these laws and power for their benefits. The system is far from repair. \n\nMay Atul rest in peace. And all those bastards be held responsible.",

        "Yes, that's what we mean here. Not trying to generalize all men or women alike. As I mentioned in my previous comment, **some** men don't deserve life, and the innocent ones have it snatched from them one way or the other, by misusing the laws made to keep the **some** men under control.",
        "Some men don't deserve life? You can phrase it as some people as it should include everyone right?.... because you are doing same as the screwd up system right?",
        "I mean it in the sense that there are special provisions for r\\*pe or domestic abuse cases, to hold the man accountable and punish him.\n\nCrime has no gender, I know that, but the special provisions are made against men only, as far as I've seen.

        "I hope laws should be gender neutral may be atleast not judge every man as guilty as soon as someone accuses them....\n\nI am willing to accept there are evil men who deserve punishment worse than death....but can we agree we should atleast acknowledge that not every woman that accuses a man is not always does it in good faith",
        "Yes I understand your sentiment ...there is no question about that ...I'm only saying you could have phrased it differently I did not mean any disrespect I completely understand your stand wording could have been different is what I meant",

        "Agreed. But as you see in this case, the laws played less of a role than the corruption. The judge, knowing the complete truth, was fed money from the woman (the money she unrightfully extorted from Mr. Atul). She could have stopped it, she could have saved his life and brought justice but she chose money over and over.\n\nBut yes, gender neutral laws are very much needed, as well as strict action against corruption. How ironic though, those who enforce policies against corruption are corrupt themselves. It's a vicious cycle."
