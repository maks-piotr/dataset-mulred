        "Caught fever last week, ended up finishing two books while lying inside blanket.  (Last two books of 'Of blood and bone' trilogy. They're good one time read, but not as good as expected. )          \nMe - 1, Fever - 0 .",
        "Am currently reading 'Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay - The Demolition and the Verdict'. Deals in detail with the history of the Ayodhya dispute. It is an interesting read but at times his passing between pre-1991 episodes to those leading to the events leading up to the Supreme Court verdict can happen abruptly leaving one confused about what one is reading about. There is a lot of clutter that could have been done away with or presented in a way that leads to the main thrust of the argument.\n\nNevertheless it is pretty informative. It deals with an important aspect which I too felt the Supreme Court had overlooked - the seeming lack of references to an actual temple at Ayodhya or pilgrimages to Ayodhya in the texts of that time. From the facts it would appear that the mosque was built over the ruins of a Buddhsit temple. The court overlooked the representation from the Buddhists in its final verdict.",

        "Finished ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù last week. It‚Äôs a great read, full of philosophical and psychological questions.\n\nStarted The Ship of Magic and it has been amazing so far. Robin Hobb‚Äôs world building and character development is unparalleled.",

        "Reading Red Rising series by Pierce Brown.\nNovel is set in distant future where humans have colonised the entire solar system. However to get to this point, a rigid and oppressive societal system has been erected where the society is divided into different colours with each having their own roles (similar to the caste system in India but much more rigid and oppressive due to technological advancement). The golds are at the top, destined to rule while the reds at the bottom, the caste of people relegated to live like moles and labour for the rest of the society.\n\nThe main character Darrow is a red living in Mars. His job is to mine helium 3 so that one day the surface is hospitable for future generations. Though he is only 16, he is married to his wife Eo whom is loves dearly. (The reds marry young and die young down in the mines). The reds live in abject poverty but they are a tough and proud clan. They have been told that they pioneers on Mars, making the place hospitable for human life which is essential for the survival of the human race. \n\nDarrow's wife Eo happens to be a rebel. She knows that they have been lied to and oppressed though brute force, systemic scarcity of resources and propaganda. Darrow's life turns upside down when he and his wife are arrested due to trespassing into an area restricted to the bronze administrators. Eo is executed and he is next on the list. But then he is saved by a revolutionary group known as Sons of Ares. The Sons of Ares have a plan for Darrow. Due to his intelligence dexterity and constitution, he is selected to undergo genetic surgery to turn him into a gold and infiltrate the Institute, an academy which produces top leaders of the system. Darrow's goal is to rise as high as he can within Gold ranks so that he can assist in the eventual revolution.\n\nI absolutely adore this series. There are 5 books written till now, with the last one scheduled to release this year. The cutthroat competition between the golds is reminiscent to the Hunger games. The politics, action, character development makes the story very compelling. Especially in the second book titled Golden Son where every chapter feels like it ends on a cliffhanger and I can't help but continue reading.",
