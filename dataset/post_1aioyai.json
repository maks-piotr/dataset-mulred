    "selftext": "25M from Mumbai. Apart from the usual insecurities people have regarding hair, body weight etc. - there is this one thing which I have a tough time getting over - skin colour. I'm a lil dark skinned (a lil lighter than this- [https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201902/Ajay-Devgn\\_0.jpeg](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201902/Ajay-Devgn_0.jpeg)) (mostly darker face than body types). I have got a tough history with it where I was teased for not being fair skinned from friends, a few family members. Used to think I'll \"lighten\" it up once i start earning well. But now that I have my own home, earn well, do what I love - this is the only thing that I see hurting me. I feel underconfident in inter-personal relationships, dating, wearing clothes etc. The worst of all is that my parents - obviously indirectly- have started asking to do a lot of things to look fairer etc obviously for marriage prospects etc.\n\nAfter 4-5 months of disciplined skin care routine, I am at a juncture, where I think i can get it treated - just to get more confident about myself, and probably have an even skin tone throughout and more important - MENTAL PEACE.\n\nWhat do you think? Should i get it treated? I can afford it if its under 50k ig. \n\nFor folks in the same boat, how did you overcome this insecurity?",

        "Dude don't try skin whitening treatment. Not worth it. \n\nWork on your confidence. And you are 25 and have your own home in Mumbai, that puts you in the top 1%. \n\nMy advice will be. Don't try to change your natural skin color. Embrace it.",
        "There are things you can control and there are things you can’t control. Unfortunately, what you’re saying is the hand that’s dealt to you and totally out of your control. Don’t sweat that - the more you think and try to obsess over it, the more your confidence tanks, and the more people will mess with you. Instead, ignore those comments and don’t show your vulnerability to them. You are successful in life. Use what bought you success to build up your confidence and lean on those qualities that made you successful….",

        "Things like colour of your skin you have no control. You can control weight, salary, job, things that can be changed so don’t stress over these things. If someone judges you for the colour of your skin they weren’t right fit for you anyways Love yourself and only then others will love you.\n\nwe Indians are obsessed with fair skin #shadeism that’s sad in this day and age but things are changing.",
        "Your insecurities are nothing to with physical appearances, it is showing through the physical appearances, if you fix this, something else will come up, I would go to therapy or talk with elders in your town who can help you and give some wisdom how to get out of your thinking and be grounded in yourself",

        "Look man,\nThere are two things here, if it makes you feel better go for it.\nIf you think you can \"accept\" it , try, but the fact you're 25 and still haven't accepted it, is an indicator that you're not going to do it easily.\n\nAnd don't listen to these commenters who say \"it does not matter\", or \" every colour is beautiful\".\n\nThey are all hypocrites , I've been bullied my entire life for my color, so yeah  I say GO FOR IT.",
        "I was in a similar boat as you when I was living in India, people used to say all kinds of things about my dusky complexion and about my skinny body. I used to feel bad about it, but over the years I realized that people (especially in India) need something to talk about, no matter how good you are, they will find something imperfect about you and keep telling you that you need to fix it. Once your skin is white, they will find another problem with your body, if not with your body, then with your relationships, if not with your relationships then your professional life, if not with your professional life then...\n\n\nI came to terms with the fact that I am more than just my face and my body and if someone has a problem with it, then it's their problem, not mine. \nWhen I was younger, I used to ask people like this (these people usually have fair complexion), that what they have achieved in their lives, has their fair complexion helped them..., they usually used to get angry when I did that because they usually didn't have a good answer to that. I don't do that anymore because ignoring such people is the best response, I am telling this to you because I don't want you to give any attention to these people.",

        "Skin-whitening treatment will age you and destroy your skin.\n\nWork on your insecurities and internalised colourism.\n\nIf you care so much about what people think, remember Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o and other dark skinned actors are widely considered as certifiable beauties. It's just Indians who hate ourselves for something that is a desirable skin-tone worldwide. Like the Kardashians and Ariana Grande spent a fortune trying to look brown.",
        "1st step is to embrace yourself however you are. Going for a skin treatment in an attempt to lighten your skintone just puts you in exactly the same category as your those so called friends who teased you earlier, that is RACIST bcs you too view lighter skin tones as superior, whereas when it comes to marriage prospect anyone who is blessed with a good heart and nature will instantly reject you bcs of the way you view the world. It will leave a permanent stain on your character. Why bother your hard earned money on such practices that will ultimately lead to deep down self regret. As said Life is too short too judge and get judged, throw all such insecurities aside. Everyone feels that they are the spotlight in the crowd, but the truth is everyone is busy with their own hurdles , and those who still bother with all these even being mentally stable are labelled outright BROKE. Enjoy the life after all the stress and struggles you have enamoured in your 25 yrs of life to reach at this stage of life. Be cheerful buddy and I wish you the very best of luck for your future plans.",
        "I’m dark skinned and I absolutely love my skin color. If I was lighter skinned I’d always would have thought what it’s like to have dark skin. You and I have fundamentally different beauty standards and quotients. If I were you, I’d get a skin care routine and focus on getting glowing skin? Eat a lot of good food and drink hella water",
        "I’m still trying to overcome this insecurity by telling myself I’m more than my skin colour. And that my self worth remains the same regardless of my skin colour. \n\nSadly, colourism is so deeply ingrained in us Indians we naturally give more value/importance to a whiter skin tone. However, the perspective differs wherever you go. In Europe, for example, I was exoticised for having a wheatish (this word is used mostly in India) skin tone. Europeans usually select tropical destinations for their summer vacation to get ‘tanned’. Infact, the more you’re tanned, the more people assume you’re rich (this is what my European friends told me). \n\nWhat I’m trying to say is the grass is always greener on the other side. Straight haired people want to curl their hair & vice versa. Embrace what you have & find people who see beyond your skin tone :)",
        "As someone who is dark skinned , I have learnt that indians are very insecure about their skin color, Their racist perceptions and prejudice based on color is  a product of their upbring and lack exposure/knowledge. \n\nI find my skin color to be blessing, as occaisional racist encounters act as lessons and have helped me become more humble, matured and respectful. To me, These experiences are what make me different from the majority of close minded, brainwashed people who believe that color is everything. \n\nEmbrace your natural self, Trying to fit into these clusterfuck of social norms makes your mentality no different from the very racial standards you are trying to escape from. Perhaps you might find a cheaper or more suitable skin whitening treatment, but the real cost is your identity.",
        "I married someone who is dark skinned. I think he is beautiful and he also owns it. It never mattered to me. People always like doling out advice - ignore it and go your own way. Your skin color is yours and the quicker you embrace it and work on accepting yourself - the better off you will be. The world will always find something wrong with the way you look or just are. You cannot change yourself to appease people.",
        "My understanding is skin whitening is not possible.\nThere are few options like: glutathione. Will stop working as soon as you stop the dose. So not gonna work.\nYou have skin lightening creams having mercury. This can really whiten your skin but you will get mercury poisoning. I read a Korean women who had miscarriage due to this.\nThird is laser.\nThis will not whiten your skin, but may be lighten it 1-2 shade and is generally safe.\nYou need to do good skincare to maintain it.\n\nI would say just build a good body, wear good clothes and be rich if possible. People will be pleased with you.\n\nYou see Will smith actor? He looks good right with dark skin. Work on your fitness instead. That’s something you can change",
        "I looked in the mirror one day stared at my bald ass head and said fuck it let me rock the bald head instead of putting my self through all the prp treatments and the finastride. There's no manual or a standard of beauty set by a committee, all beauty is subjective. Beauty standards aren't monolithic. We are all playing with cards we are delt with and there's no exchange policy, so better play your hand to the fullest and be happy. Stop comparing yourself with others, this is the source of most of our problems.",
        "My dear friend, you live in a country whose demography has genetically higher melanin, derive power from it not insecurities!\n\nMelanin is beautiful, doesn't matter less or more. Your skin tone is a part of your identity, it makes you unique from others! It's fantastic that you have developed skin care routine but what you really need to take care of is your limited knowledge. \n\nIt's cool, you can read so many articles out there which celebrate different skin tones! \n\nYou are amazing just the way you are! 🙏😎",
        "You’re 25 and own a home in Mumbai? Dude you’re already way ahead of most folks! That is an INCREDIBLE achievement! \n\nTake it from one dark skinned guy to another, the colour of your skin DOES NOT MATTER! You want to get over your insecurities? Join a gym, follow a healthy diet, read 1 book a month and pick up a musical instrument. Do this for 2 years and by 2026 you’ll not recognise the guy who wrote this post.",
        "My father is extremely dark in complexion yet he is the most confident person out there. It’s because firstly he doesn’t give a fuck about what people say about his complexion. Secondly he has also been very sound professionally with an extremely jovial nature that people love him for his personality. Even if someone would comment on his complexion, he would ward it off as a banter and embrace it so beautifully that the other person would get embarrassed. \n\nSo please don’t be insecure about your complexion. There’s a lot more than that. It’s the personality that is attractive, not the complexion.",

I have very fair complexion but I don’t mind being with a guy who is not fair. \nWhat actually matters - your knowledge, hygiene, you are respectful or not. \n\nAdditional tips - work on your dressing, get good perfume, get a nice hairstyle. \nYou should be good. Skin color is not the thing girls want.",

I used to feel the same while growing up, but then i got introduced to other cultures of the world, like black Americans and their media, how they own it and have come up so far. So yeah they did influence me a lot, and in large made me feel like yeah there exists people like me whom I can relate to. \nAlso I started hitting the gym and started putting sunscreen(a must) and just in general moisturized the skin, not just the face. \nAnd it did wonders, just taking basic care of your skin and keeping it healthier is key.\n\nI would say don't let their own beliefs and choices project on you. You're so much more than their opinions. A lot is going on for you.",

There are thousands of white handsome and sharp looking guys but they give toxic vibes...

Show how you are not bothered by what they say and their opinion doesn't affect you at all. \nBut yea understand it is what it is and expect things accordingly",
        "I am dark and proud. This is what I think and sometimes say to people who may speak like your parents: beauty is in the eye and that of most Indians are corrupted by centuries of colonialism/slavery to consider light skin as beautiful. The country needs to recognise itself as a people originally of dark skin that provides more protection and is less prone to skin cancer. They need to stop using fair skinned models or even foreign ones in ads etc. to help Indians accept and be proud of how they are instead of aspiring to look like their erstwhile masters. Until that happens help yourself and know that the case and that the others are all suffering from slave mentality. \nI was shocked and sad reading your post and am sure you are not alone. Hope you don’t harm yourself because of slave mentality.",
        "It goes as with all other insecurities- the truth is, if it were not for the history of colonialism & racism, you would not have to even think about it. So your issue is not dark skin, your issue is racism and colorism & how they affect your life. So try to rationalize it. You are not the problem, your skin color is not the problem. Racism is, colonialism is, colorism is. \n\n\nSame goes with other social issues, like sexism leading to the idea that women need to have xyz body type. If you do not rationalise it, you will eventually keep changing yourself cause there could always be a new problematic thing and you will have to adapt or will fall for thinking \"no how do I change that about myself. I am not good looking\". \n\n\nDark skin is the most beautiful thing. \nBeing confident in your own body is the most beautiful thing. \n\n\nPlease please, surround yourself with people who respect you. Call out colorism when it happens and do NOT harm your skin and risk your health. ",

You'd eventually have flawless brown skin.\n\n**Treatments like skin lightening and whitening are invasive. The more you do, the faster your skin will age.** \n\nI have a sister who is a lot fairer than me. My grandmother says stuff like \"She is more beautiful than you, your dark skin is ugly and no one would want you, everything looks better on her than on you\"  I tell her that I'm amazing and I love the way I am and don't give a shit about what she or anyone else thinks.",

Then, to that, all I’ll say is that I don’t give a fuck about the component of skin color with regards to my evaluation of beautiful women or handsome men (I’m straight). Perhaps our differences arise since you’re from india, I was born in the US and have lived to have harbored America’s interpretation of beauty. And trust, me here there is beauty found in every ethnicity and of every race. I have met so many stunning dark-skinned South Indian American women here throughout uni it’s insane. That’s why my anecdote completely trumps your interpretations of beauty, because I find them and I find light-skinned women beautiful too. There’s beauty literally in every type of morphological phenotype in the human female bruh 😂😂😂.

I’m getting there, but I started balding 🤷, so I might just wear a hair system in the future",

    "light_cleaned_title": "How do you get over your physical insecurities?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "25M from Mumbai. Apart from the usual insecurities people have regarding hair, body weight etc. - there is this one thing which I have a tough time getting over - skin colour. I'm a lil dark skinned (a lil lighter than this- [https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201902/Ajay-Devgn\\_0.jpeg](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201902/Ajay-Devgn_0.jpeg)) (mostly darker face than body types). I have got a tough history with it where I was teased for not being fair skinned from friends, a few family members. Used to think I'll \"lighten\" it up once i start earning well. But now that I have my own home, earn well, do what I love - this is the only thing that I see hurting me. I feel underconfident in inter-personal relationships, dating, wearing clothes etc. The worst of all is that my parents - obviously indirectly- have started asking to do a lot of things to look fairer etc obviously for marriage prospects etc. After 4-5 months of disciplined skin care routine, I am at a juncture, where I think i can get it treated - just to get more confident about myself, and probably have an even skin tone throughout and more important - MENTAL PEACE. What do you think? Should i get it treated? I can afford it if its under 50k ig. For folks in the same boat, how did you overcome this insecurity?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Dude don't try skin whitening treatment. Not worth it. Work on your confidence. And you are 25 and have your own home in Mumbai, that puts you in the top 1%. My advice will be. Don't try to change your natural skin color. Embrace it. There are things you can control and there are things you can’t control. Unfortunately, what you’re saying is the hand that’s dealt to you and totally out of your control. Don’t sweat that - the more you think and try to obsess over it, the more your confidence tanks, and the more people will mess with you. Instead, ignore those comments and don’t show your vulnerability to them. You are successful in life. Use what bought you success to build up your confidence and lean on those qualities that made you successful…. You need to work on your mental strength and not skin colour. Things like colour of your skin you have no control. You can control weight, salary, job, things that can be changed so don’t stress over these things. If someone judges you for the colour of your skin they weren’t right fit for you anyways Love yourself and only then others will love you. we Indians are obsessed with fair skin #shadeism that’s sad in this day and age but things are changing. Your insecurities are nothing to with physical appearances, it is showing through the physical appearances, if you fix this, something else will come up, I would go to therapy or talk with elders in your town who can help you and give some wisdom how to get out of your thinking and be grounded in yourself Any skin whitening treatment is temporary, once you stop, you will return to your old Skin. Scary part is that sometimes hyperpigmentation comes back stronger Look man, There are two things here, if it makes you feel better go for it. If you think you can \"accept\" it , try, but the fact you're 25 and still haven't accepted it, is an indicator that you're not going to do it easily. And don't listen to these commenters who say \"it does not matter\", or \" every colour is beautiful\". They are all hypocrites , I've been bullied my entire life for my color, so yeah I say GO FOR IT. I was in a similar boat as you when I was living in India, people used to say all kinds of things about my dusky complexion and about my skinny body. I used to feel bad about it, but over the years I realized that people (especially in India) need something to talk about, no matter how good you are, they will find something imperfect about you and keep telling you that you need to fix it. Once your skin is white, they will find another problem with your body, if not with your body, then with your relationships, if not with your relationships then your professional life, if not with your professional life then... I came to terms with the fact that I am more than just my face and my body and if someone has a problem with it, then it's their problem, not mine. When I was younger, I used to ask people like this (these people usually have fair complexion), that what they have achieved in their lives, has their fair complexion helped them..., they usually used to get angry when I did that because they usually didn't have a good answer to that. I don't do that anymore because ignoring such people is the best response, I am telling this to you because I don't want you to give any attention to these people. Is it that you feel underconfident because others you used to make you feel like that in the past and that feeling isn't gone yet or others still make you feel underconfident? Skin-whitening treatment will age you and destroy your skin. Work on your insecurities and internalised colourism. If you care so much about what people think, remember Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o and other dark skinned actors are widely considered as certifiable beauties. It's just Indians who hate ourselves for something that is a desirable skin-tone worldwide. Like the Kardashians and Ariana Grande spent a fortune trying to look brown. 1st step is to embrace yourself however you are. Going for a skin treatment in an attempt to lighten your skintone just puts you in exactly the same category as your those so called friends who teased you earlier, that is RACIST bcs you too view lighter skin tones as superior, whereas when it comes to marriage prospect anyone who is blessed with a good heart and nature will instantly reject you bcs of the way you view the world. It will leave a permanent stain on your character. Why bother your hard earned money on such practices that will ultimately lead to deep down self regret. As said Life is too short too judge and get judged, throw all such insecurities aside. Everyone feels that they are the spotlight in the crowd, but the truth is everyone is busy with their own hurdles , and those who still bother with all these even being mentally stable are labelled outright BROKE. Enjoy the life after all the stress and struggles you have enamoured in your 25 yrs of life to reach at this stage of life. Be cheerful buddy and I wish you the very best of luck for your future plans. I’m dark skinned and I absolutely love my skin color. If I was lighter skinned I’d always would have thought what it’s like to have dark skin. You and I have fundamentally different beauty standards and quotients. If I were you, I’d get a skin care routine and focus on getting glowing skin? Eat a lot of good food and drink hella water I’m still trying to overcome this insecurity by telling myself I’m more than my skin colour. And that my self worth remains the same regardless of my skin colour. Sadly, colourism is so deeply ingrained in us Indians we naturally give more value/importance to a whiter skin tone. However, the perspective differs wherever you go. In Europe, for example, I was exoticised for having a wheatish (this word is used mostly in India) skin tone. Europeans usually select tropical destinations for their summer vacation to get ‘tanned’. Infact, the more you’re tanned, the more people assume you’re rich (this is what my European friends told me). What I’m trying to say is the grass is always greener on the other side. Straight haired people want to curl their hair & vice versa. Embrace what you have & find people who see beyond your skin tone :) As someone who is dark skinned , I have learnt that indians are very insecure about their skin color, Their racist perceptions and prejudice based on color is a product of their upbring and lack exposure/knowledge. I find my skin color to be blessing, as occaisional racist encounters act as lessons and have helped me become more humble, matured and respectful. To me, These experiences are what make me different from the majority of close minded, brainwashed people who believe that color is everything. Embrace your natural self, Trying to fit into these clusterfuck of social norms makes your mentality no different from the very racial standards you are trying to escape from. Perhaps you might find a cheaper or more suitable skin whitening treatment, but the real cost is your identity. I married someone who is dark skinned. I think he is beautiful and he also owns it. It never mattered to me. People always like doling out advice - ignore it and go your own way. Your skin color is yours and the quicker you embrace it and work on accepting yourself - the better off you will be. The world will always find something wrong with the way you look or just are. You cannot change yourself to appease people. My understanding is skin whitening is not possible. There are few options like: glutathione. Will stop working as soon as you stop the dose. So not gonna work. You have skin lightening creams having mercury. This can really whiten your skin but you will get mercury poisoning. I read a Korean women who had miscarriage due to this. Third is laser. This will not whiten your skin, but may be lighten it 1-2 shade and is generally safe. You need to do good skincare to maintain it. I would say just build a good body, wear good clothes and be rich if possible. People will be pleased with you. You see Will smith actor? He looks good right with dark skin. Work on your fitness instead. That’s something you can change I looked in the mirror one day stared at my bald ass head and said fuck it let me rock the bald head instead of putting my self through all the prp treatments and the finastride. There's no manual or a standard of beauty set by a committee, all beauty is subjective. Beauty standards aren't monolithic. We are all playing with cards we are delt with and there's no exchange policy, so better play your hand to the fullest and be happy. Stop comparing yourself with others, this is the source of most of our problems. My dear friend, you live in a country whose demography has genetically higher melanin, derive power from it not insecurities! Melanin is beautiful, doesn't matter less or more. Your skin tone is a part of your identity, it makes you unique from others! It's fantastic that you have developed skin care routine but what you really need to take care of is your limited knowledge. It's cool, you can read so many articles out there which celebrate different skin tones! You are amazing just the way you are! 🙏😎 You’re 25 and own a home in Mumbai? Dude you’re already way ahead of most folks! That is an INCREDIBLE achievement! Take it from one dark skinned guy to another, the colour of your skin DOES NOT MATTER! You want to get over your insecurities? Join a gym, follow a healthy diet, read 1 book a month and pick up a musical instrument. Do this for 2 years and by 2026 you’ll not recognise the guy who wrote this post. My father is extremely dark in complexion yet he is the most confident person out there. It’s because firstly he doesn’t give a fuck about what people say about his complexion. Secondly he has also been very sound professionally with an extremely jovial nature that people love him for his personality. Even if someone would comment on his complexion, he would ward it off as a banter and embrace it so beautifully that the other person would get embarrassed. So please don’t be insecure about your complexion. There’s a lot more than that. It’s the personality that is attractive, not the complexion. I am a female and for us skin color doesn’t matter. I have very fair complexion but I don’t mind being with a guy who is not fair. What actually matters - your knowledge, hygiene, you are respectful or not. Additional tips - work on your dressing, get good perfume, get a nice hairstyle. You should be good. Skin color is not the thing girls want. The only thing you should do is go to the gym I have my skin on the darker side and while living in a 3rd tier city. I used to feel the same while growing up, but then i got introduced to other cultures of the world, like black Americans and their media, how they own it and have come up so far. So yeah they did influence me a lot, and in large made me feel like yeah there exists people like me whom I can relate to. Also I started hitting the gym and started putting sunscreen(a must) and just in general moisturized the skin, not just the face. And it did wonders, just taking basic care of your skin and keeping it healthier is key. I would say don't let their own beliefs and choices project on you. You're so much more than their opinions. A lot is going on for you. Bro I don't know about your skin colour but I can tell I am much , much darker than you and fack it I don't care, skin whitening is not even a question , like never. It is okay to have dark skin A suggestion from a girl... Don't change color.. Stay n look smart.. fit.. Go to gym... Nice hair cut.. Wear nice decent cloths... Skin care routine will be a bonus., Maintain good hygiene... Add some confidence and Enough.. Basically your nature matters... There are thousands of white handsome and sharp looking guys but they give toxic vibes... And decent girls don't find such boys attractive at all.... And there are plenty of dark radiant looking guys who are attractive.. Confidence is the key.. only stupid insecure people do skin whitening treatment, god krishna was also dark skinned, cant understand whats wrong with society the other day they worship lord krishna they other side they discriminate with dark skinned people Use that money for a good therapist , instead of skin whitening treatment. There is no problem with skin tone . G Y M Buddy skin colour doesn’t matter. In fact women love darker skinned men. Being insecure is normal. But don’t let it dominate your thought or stop you from doing what you want to do. You wouldn’t want to be with someone who’s caveat is that you’re lighter skinned than you are. Anyone who teases you ask them \"are you plannin on marryin someone from your home to me? Then what's itching you how dark/fair I'm? Worried about your nephews? After saying this laugh confidently and don't show an iota of anger, or shakiness, teary eyed. Show how you are not bothered by what they say and their opinion doesn't affect you at all. But yea understand it is what it is and expect things accordingly I am dark and proud. This is what I think and sometimes say to people who may speak like your parents: beauty is in the eye and that of most Indians are corrupted by centuries of colonialism/slavery to consider light skin as beautiful. The country needs to recognise itself as a people originally of dark skin that provides more protection and is less prone to skin cancer. They need to stop using fair skinned models or even foreign ones in ads etc. to help Indians accept and be proud of how they are instead of aspiring to look like their erstwhile masters. Until that happens help yourself and know that the case and that the others are all suffering from slave mentality. I was shocked and sad reading your post and am sure you are not alone. Hope you don’t harm yourself because of slave mentality. It goes as with all other insecurities- the truth is, if it were not for the history of colonialism & racism, you would not have to even think about it. So your issue is not dark skin, your issue is racism and colorism & how they affect your life. So try to rationalize it. You are not the problem, your skin color is not the problem. Racism is, colonialism is, colorism is. Same goes with other social issues, like sexism leading to the idea that women need to have xyz body type. If you do not rationalise it, you will eventually keep changing yourself cause there could always be a new problematic thing and you will have to adapt or will fall for thinking \"no how do I change that about myself. I am not good looking\". Dark skin is the most beautiful thing. Being confident in your own body is the most beautiful thing. Please please, surround yourself with people who respect you. Call out colorism when it happens and do NOT harm your skin and risk your health. If you are concerned about your skin colour then don't be !! Just make it healthy not FAIRER..... Healthy skin looks good whether it's dark or white doesn't matter treatment and all is bullshit. There is only way to lighten your skin. Buy this apply for 6 months its called monobenzone. [https://www.netmeds.com/prescriptions/benoquin-cream-30gm](https://www.netmeds.com/prescriptions/benoquin-cream-30gm) Thanks man! Yeah credit to my parents for showing that level of support to buy a good home in Mumbai. This skin color nonsense was the only thing probably that always nagged me since I was 10. But I'll try to accept it. Thanks for your help! yeah i agree. will work on that! thanks! Cheers. And don't stress yourself. Yeah I'm a sucker for overthinking, but seeing this skin color trauma happening with me almost at every stage of life till now made me think that I'll get rid of this when i earn big. But yeah, things always look greener on the other end. Being thick \"skinned\" for all such hate is the way to go from here! Thanks for your though! Loving myself for me is still in the works - but for sure- accepting my skin is the biggest barrier before it. have been able to take control of my weight salary job pretty well and ill try to focus on the controllables. thanks! I didn't realise that! I was thinking of some carbon peel, given I'm not too dark; I just want my skin tone to be same throughout the body. I am not sure whether there is a safe treatment for it out there. But i think ill try to accept the way I am rn. Thanks for your advice though. The trick to loving yourself is to forget about other people's opinions and expectations. They can shove it up. You seem to have everything else sorted out. Just take care of yourself. Eat good, sleep well, exercise, dress well. Continue with your skincare, do some research and invest in good quality products, seek help from a derm. You'd eventually have flawless brown skin. **Treatments like skin lightening and whitening are invasive. The more you do, the faster your skin will age.** I have a sister who is a lot fairer than me. My grandmother says stuff like \"She is more beautiful than you, your dark skin is ugly and no one would want you, everything looks better on her than on you\" I tell her that I'm amazing and I love the way I am and don't give a shit about what she or anyone else thinks. Yeah man, when I was 18 i saw this stupid video of a lifestyle influencer who said - \"bhai abhi iska mat such career banale - fir paise fekna and ye sab this karvalena\" and i grinded the last 5-6 with that same. now that I am at a good space, these thoughts came back to haunt lol. But I'll also check the effectiveness and side effects of these things - if i decide to go for any. saari females ka aapne theka liya hain? jo unki taraf se bol rahee hain. Totally agree to what you said! I wish you the best, since I think we are in the similar situation! and yes you are definitely more than your skin, height, weight, looks, money etc. > We are all playing with cards we are delt with and there's no exchange policy, so better play your hand to the fullest and be happy. Woah! would remember this one! Thanks for your help bro yeah! sometimes i also think - today it is skin - tomorrow it would be some small problem adn god forbid - if things down turn - then there would be no turning back. I think I'll have to fix my outlook towards this non-essential characteristics. thanks! Yes. I represent whole female community. 😂 Isliye maan lo meri baat. Skin color chhod k baki chizo pe dhayan do. yeah just that these feelings came back again! and now that marriage is on the cards in the next few years - you'll find some aunty coming and saying beta facepack lagalia kar - thoda besan lagalo - shakal dark mat rakho. no wonder how worse is it for girls! At skin care, good food for the past 5 months - didn't see any great results in complexion but it does help to an extent! But i love that you accept off who you are! Thanks for your help! I think we are exactly the same. One of my motivations to succeed in life was to \"become fair\" lol. So I ran after money and got a great job and made a a.lot of money. I thought of going for treatments ,but then I told myself why I change myself for the shallow women of our society. So I didn't do it. I am 26 and have never had a girlfriend, but well it is what it is But I highly recommend, if the medications you are taking are not straight up steroids or something harmful, I say go for it! Don't listen to the losers who say \"accept yourself\". These are the same losers who bully dark people. It's your money and if those treatments make you confident, why not! I am not very dark, more like a dusky guy, in fact shared a photo of an actor in the desc(similar face tone). but thanks for the advice bro! haha! yeah i sometimes think therapy could be a solution to it..let's see if i can work it out on my end once and for all. thanks! yeah bro! at it since the past 1.5 years. was a potato. lost a ton of weight. and now gym is life - never miss any day! LFG! Love yourself that includes your skin colour It’s actually pretty simple. People should know you for what you are good at! Are you good cook, musician, sports statistician? If you are good at something and the world knows about, you will immediately become attractive when looked at! Lmao, I’m not going to attempt to interpret your tone as patronizing, rather of sincerity. Then, to that, all I’ll say is that I don’t give a fuck about the component of skin color with regards to my evaluation of beautiful women or handsome men (I’m straight). Perhaps our differences arise since you’re from india, I was born in the US and have lived to have harbored America’s interpretation of beauty. And trust, me here there is beauty found in every ethnicity and of every race. I have met so many stunning dark-skinned South Indian American women here throughout uni it’s insane. That’s why my anecdote completely trumps your interpretations of beauty, because I find them and I find light-skinned women beautiful too. There’s beauty literally in every type of morphological phenotype in the human female bruh 😂😂😂. I’ve adopted my own personal skin care routine as I wanted to get the glowing skin effect and achieve my glow up. I’m getting there, but I started balding 🤷, so I might just wear a hair system in the future I’m a light skinned Indian from Delhi and yet I feel a little insecurity about my skin color and my dark eyes. It’s a never ending shit show. No one is satisfied. There is nothing to fix here, you are not broken in any way or form, need to train yourself to accept the world as it is, even if it gives you insecurities, accept as it is, because when we think we are broken and need to fix, there is no end for this, we can keep on doing until we die, or we can train ourselves that the world is going to make me feel insecured , and nothing I can do is going to fix it, nothing, so everyday when you have that thought, practice this sentence, I heard you, now you can leave, say that every time when you are made feel inadequate either by other people, or media or your family or your friends, there is nothing broken in you that needs to be fixed Work on your fitness and keep your skin healthy. Darker is skin is very attractive when it is healthy. Apply moisture and other routines to keep it condition3d. Unless you are looking for a light skinned partner, what is the problem exactly? Fun fact: the global cosmetic industry's market size is about USD 350 billion. While roughly 50% of the consumers desire to brighten up their skin tone, the other half want to tone it down using cosmetics. What is your insecurity now, again? You're welcome. There are safe over the counter products, you should consult your derm for it By accepting them . Keep grinding and you'll be ripped as John Abraham is it wrong for me to have skin tone preference for a romantic partner? Wow! 25 and own home in Mumbai. That's crazy. Keep it up man! Thanks for those words man! Join a gym - 2 years :)) follow a healthy diet - done read 1 book a month - sucker, never take action pick up a musical instrument - seems interesting but i would want to spend more on my profession and go 10x in terms of positions and money from here. yes, im in a hurry haha! But appreciate your advice man! Woah, that's so cool man! Dads are the real OGs Thanks for helping out buddy! :) Already cruising with that, close to 2 years now, lost a ton of weight and almost a gymrat now! Thanks! I generally have stopped going outside in the sun and since I work remote, I am able to focus on my health rn. I dont understand sunscreens - leaves the skin very oily and messy somehow. But will see if I can optimise the routine for better results Thanks for those words! Much appreciated. Thanks for you advice! &#x200B; >There are thousands of white handsome and sharp looking guys but they give toxic vibes... And decent girls don't find such boys attractive at all.... I would kindly disagree on the nature part. Learnt it the hardway but mostly for girls and boys, skin color and all the other non-essential(i call them looser) characteristics matter. But totally would agree on the part where you mentioned confidence is the real deal! Then you should improve your wardrobe, buy clothes that accentuate your features. You shouldn't worry about your skin colour. Yeah somehow! That feeling takes everything over even the slightest of rejection one faces. But i think if this isn't resolved now, it'd get difficult later. &#x200B; >In fact women love darker skinned men. Can't confirm or question that lol &#x200B; >You wouldn’t want to be with someone who’s caveat is that you’re lighter skinned than you are. I think even if i fix this with some treatment, she'd find some other reason that is a problem. a shithole from there. i think no one is perfect and i would love to have a partner who is way more than her skin color or any other characteristics. But thanks for helping me here. yeah i agree. it is all about focusing on what's at hand and what can be worked upon. Love your mental strength bro! I agree skin color is a sad story in India. We should thank the british and colonial mindset for it. The fact that I heard a lot about it from relatives lately and then some indirect mentioneds about it was disheartening. &#x200B; >Hope you don’t harm yourself because of slave mentality. No! Never. I was a 0 after graduating during the covid period. Lost almost everything careerwise and built from scratch, all my working my ass off. I am where I am because of ME and only ME. I am grateful for the ppl in the journey but i am little narcissistic about my achievements now. Thanks for your advice though. yeah I agree, the 12 year old me was once fighting with my close friends because they teased a dark skinned girl haha ( had a crush on her lol) - but yeah- i try to call it out where i see something like it. i was thinking of some carbon peel treatment. but i have little to no research on the safe treatments possible. But ill see if i can fix myself without it. Yeah, ngl, I hate wearing light colored clothes, don't wanna expose my skin color too much haha! and I feel for you as well. Hope you get through it with a wide smile. :D Thanks though. Amen. Very true. Thanks! Oh really? Now this is interesting. But yeah its always greener on the other side. All i can say is there are many indians dumping in lakhs of rupees to get your skin color. So better be grateful and proud with who you are. Good luck! Will do thanks! Look I am not having any hardcore preference for my to be partner. All I want is someone who is good on values, educated to a good extent and more important believes in mutual respect and loyalty. I think if a guy finds a girl who fits this, he should consider this a big W. lol. It's just that some stupid relatives told to find a fair skinned girl to have light skinned babies, haha! It feels like they consider fair skin as a success. And ofcourse the history behind this insecurity was also quite frustrating. Anyway, I'll try to work on this mentality now. Remember that it includes your parents and loved ones and yourself too. Everytime you think you are ugly or do not like your skin color - you are bullying yourself and show internalised colorism towards yourself, even thou your skin color did nothing wrong. hey. no i didn't intend to patronize or looked down you or anyone who commented here. sorry if it sounded that way. i just loved and respect the fact that i can count on so many brilliant folks in the world as some inspiration for getting mentally tough and accepting myself, the way I am. I agree there would obviously be differences across geographies, some good some bad but everyone is unique and interesting in their own way. As for skincare, yeah I'm also trying to find that perfect combination of skincare that helps my skin and keeps it clear of any disturbances. And yeah, I also have got some hair problems(premature graying) going on with me :), and personally i wouldn't want to hide it with some color etc..i can change it whenever i want though. but sometimes it looks cool to have some grays haha :D You are welcome. Forgive people their ignorance and stick with what you know. Get enough sun to get your vitamin d and improve mood etc. Keep working on your career no doubt! If a musical instrument feels like too much commitment, then start learning foreign languages. Maybe start with German or a language that gives you an upper hand to work internationally! By taking anti-depressants. Doesn't really work, but it's enough that you don't end up deleting yourself."
