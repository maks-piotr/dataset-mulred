    "selftext": "I am foreigner interested in acquiring a book about the Ramayana of Valmiki, but the price is a bit salty where I live. So I was browsing other regions and I was surprised by how cheap that book is in India - compared to my region, your average price is half as much the last discounted price Amazon had here.\n\n[In this table](https://i.imgur.com/kz0PSwO.png) you can see that Amazon.in is 900 rupees cheaper than the second cheapest option (700 from Amazon's partners), and the book is ‚Çπ1,029.00 (also from a partner, but fulfilled by Amazon).\n\nSo it made me curious, are books really cheap in India, or is it just this book that is cheap for some reason only Amazon knows?\n\nThanks!",

        "It really depends on the book - publisher, author, page count, language. 300-700 rs. is the average price of story books most people would buy. Some bestseller english novels can sell for even cheaper (200rs). It really depends on the exclusivity of the content and the publisher - classic book contents (out of copyright) can be republished by different publishers at different price point and paper quality, whereas new books from some premium publishers can cost quite a bit (800-1500 rs). In general, more than 1000rs can be considered quite expensive as a book. \n\nInternational academic/niche books are a different beast - without a local publisher, it can cost significantly more than US price and is hard to get. Students might have to do with library copy/xerox/old books. Some books might even be cloned (scanned pdf print) to get them at a reasonable price point. \n\nP.s. Sharing the book link would help.",
