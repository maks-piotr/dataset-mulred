    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1fvs485/why_do_indian_uncles_ask_for_ctc_so_casually/",
    "selftext": "So I have come home for few days since my father is getting retired . So a lot of Uncles are coming to meet him . And me being the only son , I have to meet all of them . While my sisters dont care to meet them .  Now this one uncle started talking about my career and salary , and directly jumped to how much I earn now (\"Kitna mil jaata hai ?\") . Now I thought i would just brush it off somehow but couldn't. So ended up telling him 40LPA, a round fig which is a  tiny bit more than I earn  .\n\nNow the funny thing is I asked about his son who recently got placed . Lol he didn't tell the exact number. His son did masters from ISI  Bangalore. He started saying that he got placed low because he sat for the first company and couldn't sit for other placements . He even said the average placement was 40LPA at the college üåù. I am like man why do you have to match the number that I quoted . I have been working for 6years to reach there. There people have just come out of college, although with a masters degree but still 40Lpa doesn't sit right.\n\nNow I have realised the best way to deal with such questions is to reply with an insanely inflated number. Next time anyone asks me i will say 60 LPA üíÄ",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Why do Indian uncles ask for CTC so casually",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "So I have come home for few days since my father is getting retired . So a lot of Uncles are coming to meet him . And me being the only son , I have to meet all of them . While my sisters dont care to meet them . Now this one uncle started talking about my career and salary , and directly jumped to how much I earn now (\"Kitna mil jaata hai ?\") . Now I thought i would just brush it off somehow but couldn't. So ended up telling him 40LPA, a round fig which is a tiny bit more than I earn . Now the funny thing is I asked about his son who recently got placed . Lol he didn't tell the exact number. His son did masters from ISI Bangalore. He started saying that he got placed low because he sat for the first company and couldn't sit for other placements . He even said the average placement was 40LPA at the college üåù. I am like man why do you have to match the number that I quoted . I have been working for 6years to reach there. There people have just come out of college, although with a masters degree but still 40Lpa doesn't sit right. Now I have realised the best way to deal with such questions is to reply with an insanely inflated number. Next time anyone asks me i will say 60 LPA üíÄ",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "No, lowball your response - they'll feel good. but why would you want to make them feel good? Why massage their ego? To be judgemental Two reasons: 1. They are nosey. 2. Because most people don't say 'no' when asked just out of sheer courtesy or pseudo respect. its their version of d!ck-measuring contest That‚Äôs how they measure anyone‚Äôs worth They‚Äôll either feel great if you earn less or taunt their kids incase you earn more. Mat batao seeda bolo it's low it's confidential.. but i am ooking forward to have 90lakh PA.. do you know anyone who can set me up for a job with this much salary? Well said Haha perfect reply I read here that they ask your caste (ctc now) to decide if you should be respected. Me like: ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•á ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ï‡§≤ ‡§ú‡•Ä, ‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§ï‡§≤ ‡§¶‡§∏ ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ñ ‡§Æ‡§π‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ Salaries should be discussed openly with everyone. The corporate policy of not discussing it was created to keep salaries low. Let uncles know. They'll probably have the knowledge that you're getting screwed and have better jobs for you. Jaat poocha toh 'shaved hai' bolneka Indian uncles and aunties have 0 sense of boundaries and shame. Will start yapping about salary, weight, complexion, height, hair, skin, marriage prospects, children or the lack thereof, etc. Hota sabke paas hai dikhata koi nahin They dont give a shit. My dad, when he first met my Indian girlfriend, said to her face that she was darker skinned than her sister. Later, he told my white American girlfriend that her skin looked pale. These guys have no filters LOL But that was 25 years ago... things may have changed now for his generation. Uncle ke bete ke L lag jayenge iske baad . They aren't asking so they can look out for you. Openly sharing salary info with colleagues, sure. With nosy relatives? Naah. ü§£ü§£ Bruh, your uncle just asked for CTC. Mere toh in-hand, bonus vgrh bhi puchte hain üòÇ A lot of things happen. A lot of things don't. Lot of things just never happen. Unkils asking CTC to help is something that most never happened. Uncle HR me hai kya and u r naive like OP to say it or smart like others to not share it My parents as well relatives frequently asks me when your CTC will get increase, xyz got 15LPA package; abc got 10LPA Nowadays I‚Äôm literally in frustration though I‚Äôve enough salary that I saves upto 15 to 20k monthly I just say ‡§ú‡§ø‡§§‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§µ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á ‡§§‡§ø‡§§‡§ï‡§æ ‡§™‡§ó‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≥‡§§‡•ã and smile :) Forget why - be assured his son will get some words handed to him tonight for getting lower package üòÑ Pagal hote he ye log. They won‚Äôt be happy anyways. I am also talking about my dad, he was not satisfied with my salary. I am satisfied but he is not. When I left the job and was jobless then he was like kuch bhi mile kar lo. Bruh why to make them feel good . Give them an insane amount . Ig uncles ask for dick measuring and to shame their kids. And aunties ask to update their arranged marriage network database. Damn 6 years 40LPA, i chose the wrong profession Nope... His kids have gone through the high CTC low in-hand situation isliye he knows üòÇ Almost everyone is naive during their first job, especially when it's asked by someone close to parents. Main nhi toh vo bta denge üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è Average placement at ISI Kolkata is indeed 40L. However, at ISI Bangalore should be lower - but still should be greater than 30L. In any case Indian uncle and aunty se Bach ke raho. This is an innocent generation who dont have filters and have fake face and thats the fact. I agree they have those negative traits of asking and comparing skin, color, height, package but thats how they are made. Why Indian‚Äôs can‚Äôt man the fuck up ? Ask uncle, I‚Äôll tell you my CTC if you tell me how much you have made in your career working ? The number he quotes add 10 lakh to it and say that‚Äôs your CTC. Because Indians BARELY have the concept of consent, privacy and personal space. They judge people with their bank balance and family's wealth. Let me tell you, a lot of them are LYING when they mention their own LPA. Jo mann mein ayein bol dena, throw in some foreign country visits as well, they won't ask again. Well to be fair everyone is an indian uncle separated in time by a decade. I got asked that question multiple times and I respond to them by saying that I don‚Äôt share this with anyone not even with my dad. Ann that is true. Parents have this thing to show off their kids income in social circles. This has some direct or indirect consequences. People think I am rude but I don‚Äôt give a fu*k. ‡§¨‡§∏ ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§≤ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à Once i said - I don't discuss money and walked off. I felt so proud. Lol avg placement of 40lpa in any college is insane. The BEST of the best, that is MBA from IIM A B C is 35 lpa Tbh I earn as much I you and I assume you also know how the actual placement statistics in most colleges are inflated, I clearly know that uncles are lying and that they can never match me salary lol. Say less bro, some people will ask for loan when they think you earn a lot. you should also have said something like \"mil jaata hai thora bohot\" and immediately started talking about his son and how's placement in his college. Never give them the info they are looking for, they are just here to compare and be jealous. Arre gaitonde bhau ü´° I always reply Bas kharcha pani chl jata h thik se. honestly I feel like they just ask so they can give you free advice/suggestions I've noticed a lots of ppl in our country likes doing itüòÇ. FR they have nothing going on in their lives I mean I discuss it with close circles . Not for showoff but because they genuinely want to know \"Next time, just say ‚ÄòOh, I don‚Äôt count, I just let my financial advisor handle it.‚Äô üòé That way, the awkward number game gets crushed before it even starts!\" Ask them their salary too before answering. Tell them yours is more than theirs, and ask them if they want to work in your company. Bas mil jaata h , kaam chal jaata h - the very cliche reply you can give. You n ur parents r enough to know how much you really earn. Some random uncle uses it either to humiliate you or to bring some marriage offers from his side. Well there was a time when my parents asked me to leave job and prep for govt exams. I denied . But being unemployed for 2 years would have made them happier then. Luckily they dont force it now . So that they don't ask you for money lol CTC. I am an indian , this is what i have experienced over many years so Indian uncles and aunties ask and get straight to the point. Where did you study? Where do you live? How much do you earn ? Are you married ? Different interpretations can be drawn from where the person asking the question is Delhi - mostly snob value Mumbai mostly practical and assessment based Bangalore you won't hear these questions here Chennai more curious and pigeon hole assessment . Calcutta don't know. All the more reason to despise these seemingly harmless questions. next time praise the size of their pelvis to assert dominance! let uncle live with it for the rest of his life being uncomfortable! indians ka bas ek hi goal hota hai. sharma ji ke ladke se better karna. western concept hai maslows theory of hierarchy. india mai toh saari needs hai sharmaji ke ladke se better karna. whats funny to me is that these parents dont compare themselves with other parents though. always kids are used as pawns to play this dick measuring contest Pretty sure not 40 even in calcutta Never share your CTC. It's the worst thing to do. Casually say I don't share my salary with anyone, I am sorry. I have done this because there was time I was earning 10k per month, and now I earn a lot better, but I know one thing my salary doesn't define who I am or what I am worth. Once you share your salary, people try to categorize you unintentionally, and it's super racist. Never share your CTC. It's the worst thing to do. Casually say I don't share my salary with anyone, I am sorry. I have done this because there was time I was earning 10k per month, and now I earn a lot better, but I know one thing my salary doesn't define who I am or what I am worth. Once you share your salary, people try to categorize you unintentionally, and it's super racist. I think it‚Äôs a boundary issue. I‚Äôve set boundaries with the entirety of my extended family, and no one dares ask me such questions. Or maybe they‚Äôre scared that my response will probably want to kill their kids and start questioning their own life‚Äôs choices. (: Kya pata apni ladki k liye potential husband dhoond rahe ho Happens less to me. But whenever they ask me my salary, I ask them theirs. \"why do Indian uncles ask for CTC\" Have some self respect, man. Call it your income. I can understand why your company would call it CTC -- from their perspective, you are an expense -- but for you to call it that is you acknowledging yourself as nothing more than that expense. I always respond: enough to keep me happy A man‚Äôs worth is how much money he makes in society. This is bitter truth I have learned as I have grown older. I just say, enough for me. Or say something very low like 4lacs. I don‚Äôt need people to know, and I don‚Äôt care what they think. Even my dad doesn‚Äôt know how much I make. The more you say your salary is, the more people with expect from you down the line. Quoting your CTC acts like a double edged sword. Be Careful. Bas aapki dua hai. Ghar chal jata hai bolke nikal Jaane ke ka Sir CTC bolo ya income bolo , kaam to tum company ke liye hi kar rhe ho . Always go low, tell them that you go to gurudwara to survive and work behind Wendy's part time Ye to sirf ye jaaanne ke liye hai ki kitni ijjjat deni hai saamne waale ko, very sad but true. Just say \"bhookha nahi sona padta hai\" and move on Lol I used to say i work at a startup and make very little. It helps weed out people who are only interested in talking to me for my status. I always quote low numbers, and pretend that I'm barely scraping by. My mom always scolds me for it but I'd rather let them think I'm lying about it being that low just to mess with their head True, lol even tier 3 colleges boast their average like that,my friend who did her engineering from chandigarh University, chandigarh, said mba guys of her college get placed at 25lpa on average. 40lpa+ in any tier 1 college is possible for only the top 20% of the crowd. Just say 2 Cr. Lol Wait for random reddit dms dwüíÄ Never give them a figure. They will borrow from you and when you'll be asking for return, they will say you have this much, why do you need it now etc etc. Just say that dal chawal ho jata hai... never give them an estimate. Tried to make himself feel better by putting you down but instead ü§≠ I‚Äôd like to add - even women get asked . What annoys me even more is , it is not just in India and it is not even the uncle-aunty types or age group: it is the comparison or nosy type mentality more than anything else . In the US there are this type which ask ‚Äú when did you come to US‚Äù without even saying the usual Hi- Hello pleasantries Aur jhaat pucha to bolna brahman In this case I prefer to be a low-key coz they just want to see that you‚Äôre not that successful. Yehi chiz unke dil ko tassali deta hai. As Mark Manson said : ‚Äú A rich guy doesn‚Äôt have to prove that he‚Äôs rich similarly A beautiful women doesn‚Äôt need to tell she‚Äôs beautiful ‚Äú Hence apne and apni family ko khush rkho, bhaad mei gya dunia ka competition. This year IIT-B has average of 4 LPA. Right? Next time just say bus kharcha nikal jata hai Majority of Indians, especially men, spend their lives centred on their jobs and salary whille having no other discernable identity So they can only make themselves feel better by depending on salary or money You aren‚Äôt bound to answer them so why even lie. Not many people have asked me such questions but those few who have asked I straight away told them I don‚Äôt discuss my salary with anyone. TBF even my parents never asked me my salary and I only told them out of respect and for them to know that I earn enough to spoil them and they can ask me for anything if and when they require anything. There's this uncle who was asked to renovate our house that we currently live in. We later found out that he had ripped us off and used low quality materials for the renovation. We discussed it and just decided to ignore him and move on. He also maintained his distance. This was around 2012. He's never been inside our house since then. About a year and half ago my grandmother had a minor accident and is bedridden. All neighbours and people in the area came to see her. This guy just drops in 3 months ago and comes in under the pretence of seeing my grandma. I was working in my room. I just came down to meet him and he suddenly starts asking me where I work, what kind of work I do and how much I earn. I was pissed and just told him that I get enough. I thought that was the last of it but no, he had the audacity to then ask my mom my salary which she too didn't answer. He then proceeded to forward his son's resume to me and to my aunt (she's a VP in a huge corporate firm) to get him a job. All these uncles are toxic and rotten to the core. My Father told me to say this if anyone asks what I earn. I tell people like Kaam chal jata h. Kharcha Nikal Jata. i tell such people to quote theirs first or straight up f off, hate nosy seniors more than modi My answer is always \"pet paani ho jaata hai\" The other thing indians insist on telling you is your last name. Thats to determine your caste and hence social standing. I refuse. Guys may I know the best answer to this question? I get a lot and I have just started my career so I don‚Äôt wanna let them know I am working with low wage pay. The diff is between bachelors and masters Bruh I'd always lowball my salary. Keep people around you happy, keep them pampered and live an easy life. lol, i have been in so many such situations and I just say 2 time ke roti khaane jitna. if they ask further, I stare them blank. even my dad is supportive of this. he says koi bhi salary pooche, irrespective of their age, no need to tell them. they're not your father in-law asking before handing his daughter's hand to you. Flash a smile üòÉ and ask them why Do they want to know!? That will eliminate more than half the questions. Next point is more custom: Be ready to keep a poker face and ask them some uncomfortable questions. That will shut up the rest. Check with your parents and tell them that you are going to ask uncomfortable questions :-) Let's say you tell your CTC and that didn mention his son's CTC. What's there to loose my friend. Its very common for them to ask these questions. And if you try to reason with them that they should n ask such questions, they won't understand. My response always has been ‚ÄúPet Bhar Jata hai itna, aur kya chahiye life mai(?)‚Äù (with a sarcastic smile). Then he‚Äôll never ask again ‚úãüèª Foreigner here. What do these acronyms mean. Like LPA - what is this? and CTC? Their whole personality is based on money and career,you live well they envy and you didnt make it they feel good about themselves.Next time dont mention how much you make instead set boundaries with them that its wrong to ask about how much money you make coz they dont have any shame about privacy. If you give an inflated number, be prepared for marriage proposals, loan requests. I don't get asked this much, but last time this happened, my answer was just the equivalent of \"more than enough\" Thats my Dad himself ... I told him my CTC, now he continuously ask every 1 or 2 weeks, that when I am switching job, or increase my ctc or to do a certification ..... And many times his talks will be like, my friends son/daughter got in this company, and got this package, like someone got in google; same will talk about some relative. ...... Another thing, my dad's sister's kid \\[*3 year older then me, but got job just recently as he was jobless*\\] not earned degree from a good college and not earn that much \\[*THough I don't judge or even ask about his ctc, bcs others ctc does not matter i guess*\\], but dad will try to put him up, and even lie for it, like will say that he is earning same as me \\[*even though he is not*\\], then dad said recently he is also doing freelancing, and earning as much as my salary.... I dont understand, why he try to put him up like me or even above, even by lying, even he is not, to belittle me. He says so proudly and also try to put me down, like dad's son is my cousin instead of me. This feels so frustrating and annoying before as it felt like comparison and putting me down, but I learned to ignore it. Anyway, it is better bcs now I learnt that \"it does not matter who says what, and to ignore it or even reply to him\", and not taking it to mind, draining my energy and wasting whole day etc. I have strong mind now. Ps. I earn good double digit lpa ctc \\[still a fresher\\] and proud of myself, as well as working hard to further improve. And never thought my dad will be like this He now got his sharmaji ka ladka LPA means what? Lakhs per year? I told my dad my CTC, now he continuously ask every 1 or 2 weeks, that when I am switching job, or increase my ctc or to do a certification .....

Equivalent of pulling out your bigger one in response. Best response. I was so frustrated once I had written a short article of sorts on this topic & forwarded it to my relatives saying it‚Äôs a forwarded message I received xD Here it goes‚Ä¶ Indian relatives & neighbours suffer from inferiority & superiority complex irrespective of their financial wealth. Some reasons : Getting a sense of superiority by comparing themselves with their relatives/neighbours is one of the few cheap thrills they can afford in their lives under the garb of social interaction AND concern ('We're just concerned for you, beta'). In India, etiquette & culture is more about touching feet & listening to elders, regardless of how they treat you. But the real global etiquette, the real culture, which is fostering good feelings in others & preventing people (even enemies) from feeling bad at all costs ‚Äî is unquestionably absent in India. Ultimately, how you make others feel about themselves says a lot about you. The typical Indian relative is lackluster, uncreative & lives an unbeautiful life. So they settle with their boring mediocre life as it is & spend the rest of their time being inquisitive about others. these relatives Never come to ask about health at our bad times but they want full information on how we're doing in our lives. LPA is lakhs per annum . Lakh is the currency here. CTC is Cost to Company . It doesnt show the complete picture of how much you will actually get in-hand . CTC usually has a base component, variable component, stocks , bonuses , etc Dal roti kha lete hai Is that considered upper middle class? isliye to son mention kar diya post pe. Uncle ne apne bete ki class laga di hogi ghar jaake. Dekh usko 40 lakh ka package mil raha hai. Should have told him even more to piss him off Ladki se umar aur ladke se salary nhi puchi jati üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è LPA- Lakh per annum, 1 lakh = 100000 rupees =~ 1200 usd CTC- cost to company or total compensation including perks aint no way matka avg from isi that too banglore is 40 lpa avg What‚Äôs CTC Then you say \"uncle ji, rent is 30 LPA, and commute is 8 LPA\". Never have been in this situation but the best response I have learnt from others in this case is \"Bas chal raha hai, kuch khas nahi\" Next time ask him what was his salary at the time of retirement. If you don't shame these uncles, they will never change their behavior. Ladkon mein tharak bahut hai. Nhich chhodte kisiko There was this uncle in.my neighborhood who loved to boast about his son who recently got placed in a good company. He would sit outside his house in the evening and tell everyone who passes by how his son is now successful and earns a lot of money. A close friend came home recently and we were talking about it. He told me the uncle has this bad habit of boasting a few years back as well when his son was preparing for the JEE exams. He decided to prank her. One evening when he was sitting outside (to boast to people obviously) me and my friend started strolling outside our homes. He called us. Started to ask us about our career. He then asks, \"salary kitni hai tumhari?\" My friend says, \"zyada nahi hai uncle abhi toh bas 2.5 crore ka package laga hai. Freshers ko itna hi milta hai\" Uncle ki shakal utar gayi. My friend then proceeded - \"uncle ye apko pata hai aas paas zameen kitne ki bik rahi hai? Soch raha hu lelu. Kaam ayegi\" From that day on. The uncle was never seen outside his house. Same difference between \"I'm living\" and \"I'm dying\". Both mean the same thing, because every moment you are living is every moment you live is a moment that draws you closer to death. Alas, the philosophy of language seems to be lost on you. Just say my Cost to the Company is ‚Äò Priceless.‚Äô Smile and walk away! lakh is not a currency, it's the amount. lakh means a million Funny bhai kaafi funny . Bhai sun : Tu aapne liye hi musibaat bana raha hai Instead of saying 40 LPA, next time play this simple trick : Uncle layoff ho gaya tha, abhi to me 18 LPA wali job kar raha hu. Phir Wo bolenge mere beta to 25 LPA Kama ta hai Your simple reply is - acha hai uncle, phir uski company me lagva dijiye please And trust me : the moment you ask these uncles for favour, they never comeback - do a casual follow up 2-3 times and they are never gonna bother you in life. From 2020 - till now, my actual salary growth is quite a lot but in eyes of my relatives and all, it is still 18 LPA & I still work at Paytm ü§£ ( even better to show that I don‚Äôt get much money because of all the drama ) I always say as you know IT industry is under pressure, lots of layoffs etc happening, it is tough to find job in such market. kala jadu vashikaran krwa denge wrna isliye inn sbse door rehna h..XD The consequence to saying 60LPA is people will start calling for monetary help :-) IMO, Iwould just say a pretty lower number so that the other person empathises and closes the discussion. P.S. I have not encountered this situation as I earn pretty low. I just say 1 Cr se thoda kam hai uncle .. and wink .. never have I have been questioned back till now üòÅ Next time tell them: \"I earn 100 INR per minute. Calculate rest of it\" then leave with little smile. Every time I get asked this question, I almost always reply to that enough to survive and then some. People who are envious and insecure People who are looking for partner for their son/daughter In any case I think just denying answer the question is the best or quote a really low number. If you say 40LPA and shit people will be envious of you and tell it to everyone around or keep taunting you by saying he's the rich man or ameer bangae etc etc. to flex People are so random, I was in Singapore and there all of a sudden an uncle from Delhi with whom I had exchanged some pleasantries asked me how much I had paid for the trip. I was stunned, didn't even know what to say. Just say 5 lakhs more than your son or daughter. Now do the maths üòâ How to flex your ctc without actually flexing it Oh yeah sorry i was lost lol . Just updated Yes somebody is gonna get hurt today.. somebaaady I tell my income depending on the person who asks, if he wants to ask me for a loan or something, I say bahut loss hogya iss saal. And if someone wants to compare, I tell them my family businesses' profit 4cr+ ( most people stop after that). Some questions you can ask to drive the point : Toh how much property uncle has? How is he performing in bed these days? Just tell him \"Uncle gareeb log poochte hain ye sab, hum to pushtaini ameer hain.\" i usually tell 2cr. Bhai inflated number bolna hai toh 10cr bolde hafte ka. /Jk I respond with kaafi mil jaata haiz ki kya karoo nahi samjhta toh Ghar pe thoda, savings me thoda, trading me thoda aur baaki jeene ka thoda spend hota hai. Aap kitna kama lete ho, (mami, mausi, bhabhi, etc ko kuch dete ho) Give vague answers and ask to the point hard hitting questions they will take the hint or get offended. Sometimes it's okay to offend some people cuz petty log cheezo ko pakad ke rakhte hai, khud se cutoff kisko karna ya bhav nahi dena dikh jaata hai. /Ps. Discussion salary, benefits and everything should be more normalised imo. No harm unless the degens are there Haha more or less CTC is a problem! The Q&A session always remain, worries uncles and aunties. its Lakhs per annum, one lakh is hundred thousand aka 1,00,000 rupees so 10 lpa would be 10 lakhs per annum I just say, theek thaak hai, kaam chal jata pura, then they generally quote a number as question, which is theek thaak according to them, and I just say yes to that, which is always way less than what I get paid. Over the years, I‚Äôve seen that relatives will expect you to help them during money problems if they find out that you earn more than their metrice of enough, and property division ke time bhi tumhara hi katega because you earn more That's exactly what I say -\"I earn enough to spend and save a bit with your blessings\" and join my hands while saying that. They usually understand this as my boundary and don't pester any further. \"do waqt ki roti kha lete ha itna\" ahh reply Next time start with this \"not much but in between 60-80 LPA\" My cousin was beaten up by his father, because his father somehow name to know my salary. üôÅ How do you earn so much bro ? What kind of job are ya doing bro ? It's gonna backfire spectacularly when one uncle needs money and asks your dad .. and then days \"your son earns 60L can't you do even this much for me\" . Avoid salary discussion, just say I get enough to afford food and accommodation and be done Aaja Ahmedabad mein, bina jaat bataye ghar kiraye pe bhi le ke dikha, kharidna to durr ki baat hein (T) Come to Ahmedabad and rent a place without disclosing your caste, (forget about buying) Bro my dad is exactly opposite! I want to switch for so long and my dad is like.. if it‚Äôs just money no! Dont switch, sort priorities first you want to give up on tennis or your easy routine the ‚ÄúWLB‚Äù at the cost of 3Lpa more? Not worth it. When you see him next time, just tell you got promoted and your new salary is 50 L. Let him stew. The only correct answer is \"enough for my needs and some savings\" (or, if you want to be snarky, \"‚Çπ1\"), unless you *know* it's more because they're looking out for you (e.g. 40L sounds about right, or _with you skills you really should ask for 60_) There's also the angle of who to ask money from if they're short. \"oh you make 40L a year, surely you can spare 50k\". bro don't! XD they'll come to ask for money someday. you better keep your money safe from them. Your money Your Rules! 40LPA is a fair package why do you with such a package hesitate to tell. I would‚Äôve brag it. ...racist? They are assessing how much respect they should give you.. Initially I wud openly tell them my CTC thinking that they are asking casually. But now I understand they r judgemental, better way is to say mil jata h achha thik thak. Just say 6. \"6 LPA?\" \"No 6 inches\" \"What?\" \"Indirect kyun pucha uncle, maine direct answer de diya\" The point is not that it is a fair package. Point is that it is my personal stuff which I dont want to disclose Never knew this side of Gujarat.. :( ~~Wow, under which rock are you living?~~ :D It's well talked about and very well documented fact. this is a common practice in Indian households, to belittle their own son, and praise sister's/cousin's sons. I see, it comes from the parent's own deep rooted inferiority complex, which they unload on their child, and belittle him/her. Even though you're meritorious than their nephew/niece they'll still try pulling you down in one or other situation. Best is to assign Zero to their opinions for your own peace, when you know you're better. PS: Indians only look at the money you earn as a metric of success. Whereas every individual can have his/her own definition of success. As a person working in govt, these uncles never ask me this, they rather show respect in a very envious way. I'd rather have that corporate money than this false respect tbf. ~I know it very well~ :'( I choose to stay ignorant... Just give different numbers to every uncle every time they ask and leave them very confused Bhai, I am staying in Gujarat for last 20 years @Surat. Previously I was staying in Mehsana. I didn't face any atrocity and neither any body asked my Jaat / caste. BTW, I am from Bengal and doing a job in MNC. aunts too. She just asked casually in front of everyone. After hearing the number she was like I should help my cousin too to get a job 2 waqt ki roti nikal jaati hai. Baki 2-4 hazaar ki saving festival me kharch ho jato hai. This takes care of most of the nosy ones. Where can I find such men? That's a dream salary and I am sure you've put a lot of hardcore work along with great grades from a great university. But what do you do for a living? Out of all this your sister is the one with brains. I won't lie I have a big brother as well and because he's the older one people generally know him more than I do and I can't be more happier about it. I remember when I went to meet my boyfriend‚Äôs mom for the first time, she asked me kitna kama lete ho. It felt a bit weird. I am born Ahmedavadi and what you says is completely wrong. I can show you ads and billboards for real estate, totally discriminating based on the caste. Just because you are an exception doesn't make you an example. Make a post mentioning you wanna make friends or you're an F. Most likely they'll pop up. Next time when someone asks how much you earn and you don't want to share it, just reply \"Enough\". I told one such nosy uncle that FBI is watching over me and that I can't disclose my salary as it is legally forbidden. I was kidding but thanks for the reply! XD Yeah, next time some uncle asks you that just say you have a \"handsome package\" üòå Yup. I am quite young, compared to my cousins. I have a cousin who is overweight, and a general slouch of a human being. Still it's unbelievable how casually people like my mother use a casual condescending remark as the ice breaker. Atleast the last time I was sure to reprimand her bullshit. My god that woman's jealousy and backbiting are a major cause of my fucked up head. Bro don't do that, they will die of cardiac attack üòÜ My answer is Thik Thak Hai CTC uncle Oopsie haha. Main to Bol detach 1 crore hai Kyun ki unko Kitna kamathe ho bolte hai Islie amko ctc bolke puchte Yeah good plan. Then they will expect you to pay for things or ask to borrow money. Tell them an amount way lower than actual and then ask to borrow money. They won‚Äôt interrogate you on salary any more. I love fuckin around when they ask shit like this. Always give them a higher number and watch jealousy take over them ü§£ I have started drawing lines whenever needed. Just like the cockroach ones. Just say No and get the popcorn ready (with caramel of course) Correct .. I made it a point to not tell my parents my CTC early on in my career and they don‚Äôt bother too much. If anyone asks them they just say he earns decent. Also I am an entrepreneur and my income varies a lot and I am potentially one of the highest tax payers in my T2 city but no one around me knows other than my CA. >Next time anyone asks me i will say 60 LPA Pagal hain kya. Quote it so low that it should contradict your lifestyle. He should realise you are being sarcastic just say its confidential. i usually tell them 50 % of what i earn. if you earn much they might ask money to borrow. its better to take sympathy then lend money. in this way they dont bother me to pay for unnecessary stuff. Once an uncle asked me \"Aap Kitna kama lete ho?\" I replied coldly \"Sharad se duguna hein mera\" Sharad is his son. That man never visited us again. Between colleagues yes. Family is asking just to benchmark and brag 7 karoooddddd Classism maybe? Bro I always respond 10k per month, if they say ki last time bhi wahi bola tha toh I increase it to 12.5k. I keep it consistent. OP EARNS 40LPA FOLKS. If anyone couldn't figure out. I had a random uncle in my building meet me in the middle of the street and state loudly how much weight I had put on and how my cheeks are chubbier for a good 5 minutes. I am a 31 year old married woman. Shocked disgusted and unable to respond in that moment, I left. When someone ask me something like this, I just put a. Exaggerated expression on my face and say it is a lot !! Worked for me till now Nothing, they are failures in life, hence they try to feel accomplished by projecting themselves on their children. Unfortunately my parents are also like this...too much invested in other's businessüò≠üò≠ This will happen you cannot avoid it, make sure you are telling 60% of your actuals if it is utterly necessary else tell them \"bas uncle ji daal roti ho jati hai uppar wale ki kripa se, kitna bhi kama lo salary to kam he padti hai aajkal.\" then divert talk to all the expenses and all... They ask just to understand the market. Someone might have cited that you earn a lot. 40 LPA is a big number. Secondly older people dont see it as offense to ask salary. They dont judge anyone past 10 lpa. Since thats a lot of for them. You are 40 LPA. I am Mechanical Engineer I started a 3.5 LPA and till first 7 years in my career I reached only 5 LPA. When you are asked at that time and compared. You feel not bad but like you whole existence is useless. Not inflated. Always say ‚ÄòItna kama leta hun ki sukoon ki do roti kha leta hun. Hai na uncle, or kya chahiye life mai? ‚Äò with zen face Say it with confidence. Is jawaab se logo ki bohot jalti hai. Kyuki they do not get number they seek for. They assume either you earn too much that you don‚Äôt wanna speak it loud. Or tooo less yet happy . I, too, don't share it with my parents. They understand that I earn good, but they are clueless about my salary. When I get asked \"Kitna mil jata hai\" and the person doesn't get the hint I don't want to respond... I reply with \"itna ki mujhe paise k liye shadi karne ki zaroorat nhi\" I'm the youngest amongst all my cousins and unmarried with the age thats considered \"too late to be married now\" in my relatives' perspectives. All my cousin brothers got married receiving lots of \"gifts\" and cousin sisters got married giving lots of \"gifts\". This leads to a bas taste in their mouth and embarrassment for my father who then jumps to salvage the situation. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Just tell them a huge number and say it takes a lot of hard work to reach here, your kid will be able to earn this much too if they work hard enough and then walk off These are the same kind of men who during school time used to peek in toilet and compare dick size. I usually say it is confidential and brush it off. Because if you say any x, they will come back with some y >>> x. Ridiculously difficult to understand the badgering though If u dont want anyone to budge u for money Then tell low ctc If u think like u wanna flex it Then tell higher ctc Ill choose former xD If you can be adamant enough to not tell them how much you earn, you can also tell them no when they ask for money. But if you feed their ego by saying you earn less, they'll ask someone else too, in hopes of feeling that ego boost again. Why give them that satisfaction? \"I am comfortable and I am not allowed to disclose it. I could get into trouble.\" Just say itna kama leta hoon ki do bhainson ka doodh pilati hai meri maa ü§£ Ha bhai kitna hai? ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer not to share my salary details, hope that‚Äôs okay with you‚Äù say that with a smile but firmly. In India we are expected to give a reply everytime someone asks us something. Not true sometimes we don‚Äôt need to give info just because an elderly person asked for it. I have found great solution for this. Always say 50$ per hour. I work with international clients and they pay per hour. So if any uncle or annoying aunty asks i just confuse the hell out of them My normal answer is \"50$ per hour one client and 30$ per hour second. It fluctualtes depends on number of hours worked\" Repond to their second question - so approx how much i make My answer \"somewhere between 10 LPA to 40 LPA. Depends on retianer amount and hours. Different project has different hourly rate some are fixed. Itna irrirate kr do unko wo smjh hi na paye aur bhag jae When you share your salary with anyone, they will categorize you and pass statements about what you can afford and what you can't. So you will start feeling the heat. If you earn good and everyone is aware, there will be high expectations about how you live your life, and they will call you chindi if you choose to live with simplicity. Second is even worse place to be, people will look down on you because of your earnings and you will be given low importance. This is my personal observation. So I never ask for anyone's salary, I am not even aware of my close friends salary , and I never disclose my salary to them, forget about disclosing it to my Dad's colleagues. Never. I just refuse to answer. They can go fuck themselves. Especially some relatives, If I say them smaller number they will judge, get cocky and try to demoralise if I say them decent numbers they will try to fleece me. Hahaha oh God such an Indian thing to do! my family was opposite money is never discussed. I still don‚Äôt know my dad‚Äôs salary üòÇ That only applies to Sthan I mean Dhanü§£. I simply say \"Bas kharcha paani nikal jaata hai\" and repeat until they give up Why do Indian gen zs get easily offended by every single thing? ü§î It's a question, answer it, don't answer it, upto u. Move on and focus on more important things in life. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This is so intrusive. Just like so much everywhere in India. I wish one could be sarcastically yet respectfully able to brush off this inquisitiveness until it becomes too insistent when a more direct approach is needed. I am exercising a direct approach right now in a different context. just say \"bas kharcha nikal jaata hai\" and move on. Be a man, these stupid stories don't need to be cared about. And that‚Äôs bad I am home for a few months. I am 29, left my job and going to start PhD soon. All the uncles and aunties are so intrusive. They want to know everything from money I was making, how much I must have saved, when am I getting married, what my salary would be after PhD. One of my uncles told me to get married soon so I can concentrate on PhD and not have to worry about doing chores at home. To measure your net worth And since they‚Äôre Indian they can‚Äôt have a real dick-measuring contest since there would only be losers üò¨ You should say ‚Äúenough‚Äù A few years ago I was asked my salary by the kind of motor mouth relative everyone has, in the middle of 8-10 other relatives. I replied quietly \"Ninety Thousand\". Relative: \"Aap milo mujhse aa ke, kuch help karta hu job change main.\" I barely even know the guy. Me, embarrassed, speaking in a low voice so no one thinks I'm bragging: \"It's 90 thousand a month.\" Relative: .... He did not mouth off for the rest of the evening. >He even said the average placement was 40LPA at the college I laughed so hard at this. Coming from a top 10 ranked IIT ,Less than 10% of IITians earn that. If that's the case people would prefer ISI Bangalore over IIT Mumbai lol. Your uncle is definitely spicing up the numbers Better to quote, enough to make my parents retire, lol.... Might just say \"Jitna milta hain usme mai bohot khush hoon\". And after that if they still poke and ask you a figure just keep saying the same thing over and over \"Arey uncleji Jitna mil raha hain usme khush hoon bas\". I know to some close relatives who have no boundaries we can't really tell anything much to their face, but we can maintain our boundary, BY making it known to them that we aren't interested and will not give an answer to a question which isn't their concern. Whether I might learn less or more, no matter I wouldn't let even the range of my salary known to people, cuz if it's less they would think less of us and more then you know unki nazar hogi. At the end if they say \"arey bacha batana nahi chahta\" , just continue your work, give a smile, get up and go from there for a while or just change the topic. One of my friends keeps asking the same question. I don‚Äôt want to answer, but she keeps repeating it. I don‚Äôt like being asked such questions. I tell ‚Äúenough to manage my expenses‚Äù üò¨ best jawab diya hai- jitni zaroorat hai, utna milta hai. as if roz bhagwan poochhte hain- kitna budget hai aaj ka? fir malik se utna hi dilwa dete hain The best answer according to me is - \"Bus uncle itna package hai ki Daal, Roti aur Kiraya nikal jata hai\" You should compare him with other dad's and give a taste of his own medicine. Like that guy's dad gifted him a bike/home etc. Speaking of boundaries... Wait till you have a child and travel by train with the toddler. Every Unkil and Auntie will want to squeeze her cheeks and feed her god-knows-what! Looking at the comments, no one is giving a fuck about the CTC so it‚Äôs alright I tell them there is an NDA between me and the company and thus can't disclose the amount. I tell them I earn enough to live happily and peacefully. \"3 waqt ka roti, kapde and makan aa jata hai. Itna kaafi hai\" Time has changed. Ab log \"Rahul naam toh suna hoga\" ki jaghe \"Rahul kitna kama lete ho\" pe focus hai. Where are all these jobs offering so much money re I just tell people really low number and let them have their ego satisfied. I just secretly feel happy that no one knows I make a lot more. Never undersell yourself, always mention a number above 1cr net after tax i hate this thing in our indian culture people poking there nose in other's life. Whenever any of my relatives asks this question i give a very blunt reply, i get enough money to sustain myself and i am sorry i cannot tell you the figure. I dont give a shit how they feel after this. It's a generational difference- while they battle on respectability, us youngins ask stuff like \"do you have pets\", \"are you a cat person or a dog person\" etc üòπüòπüòπ good analogy We didn't ask for OP's CTC but he told us all (anonymous users) so casually. Why do Indians do this? One doesn't say any figure in such situations, least of all the real salary. One tries to portray oneself as humble and get by with \"bas, guzaara chal jaata hai\" (or the equivalent in other languages) and a laugh. Can somebody tell how to respond to such questions without being rude but not even sharing the figures So you were offended when some uncle asked your salary (and I don't blame you for that) but you have no qualms about openly boasting about it to thousands of strangers on the internet. I've started answering. \"Acha hai (Its' good)\" and when they ask \"fir bhi kitna\" - (still how much) I reply - Its' quite good! by the third reply, the conversation starts getting awkward, and i brush it off with a smile! You are among the few who realizes the importance of privacy and sanctity of these boundaries. When you become an uncle, you will do much better. But there will be still a large group of Indian uncles who don't know any better. In other words, there are several people of uvuncler age today who also are sensitive and do not intrude. It may just be that such folks may not be among your dad's friends. Haha, tell them an astronomical amount like 3Cr and destroy their mental state. While you are at it tell them you got an opportunity to go to US but only got 40% increment, so waiting it out until you get atleast 80%. Make them suffer in silence. Unhinged uncles know no boundaries. So that they know who to borrow money from Every time when I visit my hometown, there is at least one relative or parents friends who ask this question. And my answer every time has been , enough to manage the city life, parents expenses and save some for future. When they ask for further details I tell them the same thing above. When they are asking this question, be sure they want to know yours because they want compare with their son or daughters. And when they try to be picky and get more details I straight forward say, if it‚Äôs less than your son/daughter then you will feel happy else you will feel sad. And I know I don‚Äôt want to make you feel sadüòÅüòÅ They understand that and stop further questioning. You said 40L? If you are earning 40L you should say 14L when asked with uncles like this your salary should always be 3lpa and food is 2lpa Pretty much sure ISI Bangalore average placement package is not 40 LPA. People get placed well with good package, but, no, 40 LPA is definitely not the average. people who go to ISI are passionate, they do not care about things like money. They often go towards research. They value respect more than money. After 12 years of experiences I will advise you never give them inflated number those people are only want to put other people below them. I always deflate my no. Around 50% than see them smirk. Listen them to boast about theirs. Than give them cunning smirk without telling them they will know you played them and never ask CTC again ever. Lmao, uncles stare at any woman who passes by like monkeys, but they like to moral police them saying 'kaise kapde pehente ho' They directly ask for in hand salary Next time say this - uncle kaha lage hue ho, sun ke apko constipation ho jayega, rehne do! ü§£ It‚Äôs a common Indian society interaction technique to bring you down to their level, and then berate you! Never-Ever play a game to others terms! Let them guess.. In India, people access each other's value by numericals. How much you earn, how many cars, houses, etc. He or other Indians ask these because they think they can. Whenever someone asks you how much you earn, always tell them a false number much more than the reality. If they want to be like this, have fun with it. Tell them you are earning 1 crore pa. And laugh at the end or wink at them. üòÜ 70% of population of urban Ahmedabad is moving out of the old Ahmedabad where they have seen how other people influence and now they don't want to be with the others again So that they can ask pic of your bob next time. Because you can never accuse Indian Uncles for Subtlety Well I had one such incident in Bangalore as well. He asked if we were Brahmin. I mean casteism is pretty much prevalent everywhere. Literally how they determine your worth as a person so they don't even see anything wrong with it! Damn, dude thats right, I am gonna tell everyone insane inflated numbers and tell them like it's a secret and I haven't told others It‚Äôs a generational thing. We‚Äôve become more and more reclusive and careful about how we interact with people. But 40 years ago, no internet no phone, talking about your life and everyone else‚Äôs life was the key form of entertainment. While some of that has been replaced, the habit is unlikely to fade away in that generation. Today it‚Äôs offensive, then it was an actual ice breaker / get to know you sort of thing. What do you do? From what I know with a master's degree and 6 years of experience 40LPA is just about right, anything less and you are underpaid. OP, next time same situation happens, just say: I think ur son or daughter is lying to you. There‚Äôs no way a fresh graduate will earn the same as an experienced professional (unless the offer was from Google or so). Congrats OP,you have achieved Sharma ji ka beta status... üòÇ Don't know about them chickas my sorry asss is feeling a bit let down though... It's good to know what's going on in the Indian job market. In the US here. Appllies everywhere. When you dont tell them the get offended. I think it's just culture with that generation and especially true more of those that have come here from india no matter the age. Early on in my career I've divulged this information only to be ridiculed. I make close to 170k USD annually and they dismiss it as if it was a small number. No number will satisfy them unless you makeup some insane number. I just don't answer any questions on salary anymore. Exactly! I had said politely \"personal finance ka mamla h I don't discuss this with anyone, sorry.\" Bhai.... Face dekhna tha! Even then he was like firbhi roughly then I gave the broadest range. ü§£ Karo beeth k guess. Thank god, I don't believe in caste system, mujhe affect nahi karega ü§£ You nailed it. So many moments I wish I had a quick retort that would make them feel like shit so they‚Äôd never cross a boundary with me or anyone else. I‚Äôm waiting for next time lmao Bro you are still earning low if you‚Äôre living in Bangalore or Mumbai or Delhi. I hope you understand that. What was their reply Agar aisa hua toh taro mairo bhairo bolke nikal jaunga (I know the language but I'll act like I don't know) It honestly depends on what you do . You can have a phd w/6 years of experience and still earn less than half of what you quoted (40lpa). Not all professions scale the same way, please stop living in delusion Panauti hai tu What did you do your masters in? i did a B.E. Sr Data Eng I say the lowest respectable amount (30k per month) as I am afraid of people borrowing money from me due to bad past experiences. No no. Just tell them a lower amount. Like pennies. Tell them Your salary is 1.2 LPA and that you are planning to start a business. ‚ÄúUncle you must have saved crores in all these years. Gimme a zero interest loan of 40L, I‚Äôll pay you back in 5 years‚Äù. Keep doing that 3-4 times and watch them run at the sight of you. Let me correct your last sentence for you - Openly discussing salaries is a good thing since it tells you about market standards. At least you won't be low-balled in interviews. Just because people don't discuss salaries is the reason why now we must pay out of pocket for analysts to share salary reports every year (such as motion recruiting). Just because people don't discuss salaries is the reason why it has become taboo. Maybe we could learn a thing or two from your uncle. mere paas to hai hi nahin üòé Still not racist it's true indeed. They bring this mindset along to other places too. Gujaratis in Mumbai love to gatekeep. If they live in a housing compelx, they will make sure to populate it with Gujaratis/Marwaris only. Fucking retards. Apna to ek hi jawab h ... Athanni Chavanni.. just tell them a low number so that they get happy and sense of pride that their son is earning more. you keep earning and enjoy your peace‚úåÔ∏è I didnt say I am earning a lot. It is good enough for me currently. But I also know there is a huge skew in the job market . So you will always feel you are not earning enough. Ye sab cheezo se upar uth chuka hoon ab. I just say - \"Bas guzara ho jata hai\" and watch their face with innocence. >you guys are not my uncle Areh beta! Kaise esa? Woh uncle seh achhe hai hum uncle aapke. üòÇ Amdani athanni kharcha rupaiya is the only right answer Totally bro ... Arre uncle ! Aunty se milwao kabhi. Batata hoon Thailand trip pe kya kar rhe the aap Apne pe kabhi nahi lenge magar apne bacho ko zarror sunayenge It‚Äôs like measuring your brick size by assessing your market price. sabko apna wala bada lagta hai Work hard to the point where revealing your income is not an embarrassing confession or a misleading lie, but a proud flex. My usual response is \"bus sukh shanti se jeevan nikal jata hai\" Once an uncle asked multiple times so I asked him, \"Ram (his son) ko kitna milta hai? Usse kitna kaam ya jyada hai me btata hu\". He went mute after that. When uncle‚Äôs ask how much do you make? I tell them - humko kya hai jee hum toh jhola uthakar chale jaayenge. There are fields other than STEM Wao ! Hade for honesty! I guess this generation has some serious issue guys. We need to fix ourselves before blaming others. I am not supporting them, i am just saying thats how it is- try to see some beautify is something at times instead of just hating everything. Agreed! Never said it isnt but we can we fix them is the question, which is a no in this case. So better see what is good in them The correct answer is \"roti khaane layak kama, leta hun\" This. That's it. Boundaries. I learnt it the hard way. No one teaches these things. I don't know why all the other answers assume the worst in people, but at least from my own experience - Indian uncles who ask this question are always looking for a groom for their own/sister's/neighbour's/watchman's daughter. If they're asking you CTC it's to enter you into their mental database on which they run their matchmaking algorithm. Bhai bandi hai meri üíÄ Uska kya One of my uncle brags how his daughter gets a stipend of a lac per month, she's my cousin too, he motivates others to study hard etc, on the other hand, she's totally burnt out, wants to quit and has lot of health issues but he doesn't care about that These uncles/aunts gets some sort of orgasm talking about your CTCs and comparing them with others and belittling you. I tell half of what I earn...too much crying by everyone & hajam nahi hota hai unhe sunke Average uncle convo. These convo are either 100% vibes or just like what op got Don't over flaunt your salary just to win a dick measuring ego contest. Once the world knows you earn good first they feel impressed and some of them feel insecure. They will start asking small loans from you which you will find hard to refuse. In case you refuse they will call you egoistic, prideful and bad person. Tell your parents also to maintain a low key. It's better to avoid the fuss. Spend, save and invest your salary wisely. You don't need to tell inflated number, in fact you should tell if at all, very less number. Try to avoid answer directly as much as possible like 'kaam chal ja raha hai big city hai, high expenses etc' , similar to like your acquaintance tried to avoid telling exact figures for his son. If nothing works out tell some random but less number. Also you don't need to be disrespectful, they are your parents friends. Uncle tera hi market badha re hain, chod gayi bandi to option rahega baad me. Aajkal arranged marriage ki market bahut kharab chalri hai waise bhi, accha hi hai pipeline bana ke rakhna. Never share your CTC. This will turn into ‚Äúarre aapka beta toh itna kamaata hai, aap udhaar do/ kharch karo‚Ä¶.‚Äù, in blink an eye. I‚Äôm from a notorious northern state so never know when someone will abduct my father for a ransom equals to my CTC, lol - kidding but as a general practice, never share finances with outsiders. I have similar uncles and relatives too, when they ask - I say ‚Äúkaam chal jaata hai‚Äù. Some hard asses don‚Äôt let it go and keep asking, but I don‚Äôt relent. The looks on their faces is worth enjoying üòÑ Just reply w 'a comfortable amount/bas ghar chal jaata hai' unless it's an uncle whose daughter you might be interested in. Aukad janni hoti hai Usine bheja tha muje! Tu kya batayega! Bhai, this never changes in such households. I am from a tier 1 college, earning \\~50L pre tax, with 4YOE. I also get same shit from my father. So, my point is that it has nothing to do with how much you make or how good you are doing. Some people just have this habit of putting their children down. What I have observed is that they are more concerned about other people's opinions, rather than their own children's happiness. ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ ‡§ö‡§≤ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ! Give a very low number, like 10% of what I really make. In reality they want to feel good about their children because comparison is important for Indian parents. It makes them feel better. And I don‚Äôt get to reveal what I make. you are so right THIS. Earning enough to cover the expenses should be the right answer for such people. Say 2crores You should've said ew. Aapka beta below average kamata hai kya? Ew. People are absolute shameless these days , they just know to flex on their achievements and make others feel small.CTC is not just one thing they flex on other things to like we got a property there , we went to so and so country for vacay etc Abe chip kar show off. You and the uncle aren‚Äôt different. One of the major reasons why I left India was this. I was considered as a rebel talking back to these sort of uncles and showing them their position. The fact that indians thrive on unhealthy competition and jealousy is beyond my comprehension. Next time if the uncle says ‚Äúkitna mil jata hai‚Äù, just say none of your business. You will feel bad at first, but will eventually realize that these sort of interferences in your life has reduced. I just tell them. 5CR. Then add monthly. Good to see their faces after. You ask them revenue and profit details first average placement of ISI Bangalore masters is not that high. Next time you meet him, ask what branch he is from. From what I know, average placement for ISI Bang is around 12-15 LPA, with exceptional students landing 25-30 LPA. The college itself is not placement oriented, hence please stop your uncle from doing such bragging while we actually publish previous year placement and package records online. PS: I am from ISI Bangalore hence commenting. I just say it‚Äôs close to 1Cr and every uncle/aunty gets very awkward üòÇ Cause ur value in front their eyes is based on the amount of money u make, It‚Äôs not there fault, it‚Äôs our cultures fault Remove one zero and that's my CTC. It's insane to imagine that somebody gets 40LPA fr! i know so many people well into their careers making a fourth of that. it's all about the perceived value of a profession and available labor pool You have a thing or two to learn from your sisters. Always give a range but never tell exact number. Why doesn't it sit right? Our company gives a base of 40LPA to fresh Masters grads too, CTC easily crosses 75-80. You wanted to flex, but couldn't lmao. How do you create that boundary with your parents? My parents enquire about EVERY aspect of my life, including what I ate for every meal. the result of limiting your personality to your kids If an Indian uncle is working in the IT Department, then how should we answer this? Asking for a friend yes they probably meant classist Being from the UK whenever I visit India that is the first thing I always get asked, no how are you, how was your trip, haven‚Äôt seen you in ages, straight to how much do you earn in the UK. Most Indians seem to think that everybody earns millions and that the streets are paved in gold! Whose boobs are bigger? It‚Äôs the same shit ‚ÄúBoundary? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù - every Indian uncle/aunty I think they do it so they can judge you. The more you earn, the more valuable your opinions and forgivable your sins. You‚Äôll never see them treat someone with respect who earns less than their own son/daughter etc. I'd rather answer lower. Inflated figures are also being heard by people around you. And Indians are nothing if not entitled. You'll become the default lender of the family. Rather answer lower, smile and wave, and not to take the \"arey beta itna kam\" personally bol do 220 volt aata hai If I were you, I'd have said 20LPA. Leave alone you rounding it up, but you would say 60 in the future ü§¶ Just live your life man coz it gives happiness infront to their goofy ass Just say - ha mil jata hai thik thak and bounce, why even give them any figure lol Wait for a year, they will start asking you money for hospital charges. Indians are the most racism culture in the US. Ever see an African American at one of the Indian witch companies ? Question- why inflate the number, is it an ego game where you have to be on the top? People are inquisitive. If I don‚Äôt want to share, and I know they are asking to measure the social status, I would downplay. Quote something meagre just for them to be happy. ‚Äú Well Thats none of your business uncle , but I assure you , it‚Äôs not low‚Äù‚Äù Kuchh shlok bolke dikhao Aham kalam, twavam kalam. Russian gulabam. Salaries should be disclosed. So that people get treated equally for pnce Brother I'm in the same boat as you. 3+ years of experience but still far from 10 lpa. I keep hearing taunts from parents. Switch is the only option but in this market it seems so hard these days. What are you planning brother ? Dm me maybe we both could help out each other in job hunting Bhai a number is not the goal. Goal is to be satisfied. See beta, that guy got this much of salary. And thanks might use some bad words towards you though. Like that bacha got this much, why can't you? Good for you man üôå . Uncle ghar hai paisa hai gaadi, do jodo me ladki bhejo ladki hui hamari üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è You don‚Äôt have to answer. I just respond, it‚Äôs a decent amount. My parents also do not know my exact salary. Finally we are comparing boobs now . Too much dick comparison was going on I always dodge the question. Apart from my parents and my partner, no one else needs to know - and only because I have a healthy relationship with them and it helps to plan life. ‚ÄúI get as much as I need‚Äù I usually give a vague answer at first but if they still persist then I quote a figure 5-6 lacks less than my CTC. Never tell your relatives how much you're making, you don't know when they'll ask for money. Uncle's ego gets satisfied knowing a low number, my ego gets satisfied in actually earning more than what I've quoted. Win, win! This is the same way they ask about your kids percentage marks this year. Because they are stupid. Never tell anyone how much money you make. If for some reason you feel compelled to then do the opposite, give them a really low number. You can rest with the fact they will not be asking you for money. It's none of their business. Then they'll reply \"Haan avg 60 hai\". Never say specifics. I lived in the urban Ahmedabad until last year. One of the poshest, most cosmopolitan areas too. There were people from all castes but not one muslim. Zyada se zyada potential recruiter ko batao salary, not rishtedaar. I remember when I was asked when i got my first job. I just said 'Nahi sorry ye toh na ho payega, mera bas chale toh ghar pe bhi na batau, itni kam hai....' with a smile. Nobody asked me this question after that How to tackle such situations is the question here!!!!! I really need an answer to this I too have a besharm fufa who would outta nowhere ask what is my salary???? I mean wtf???? Ughhhh! This post was relatable Most of them couldn‚Äôt counter it. One of them (my aunt) said she still believes Indian culture is the best in the world. According to her, ours is the only culture which cares about aging parents. So thoda curiosity is fine apparently. Muze to raste se jate jate log puch lete he mahine ka kitna bcoz they have niece and daughters to marry off... my father in law used to always ask me about my package everytime i changed jobs... My approach is the same. There was one incident though. I was invited by an uncle who is a family friend. The uncle himself is a self made man and a very nice guy. So, we were sitting at his place and one of his neighbours joined us ununounced. This neighbour was a retired judge and he asked for my salary. Initially, I didn't respond but he kept asking and the situation became awkward and tense. To diffuse the situation, I gave him a figure that was 1/4th of my actual salary. He then went on a rant about his son rejecting a govt job and instead joining private sector. In his rant, he disclosed horrible stuff he used to do to people who were businessman. I believe he missed the power and was a psychopath. I sucked it up at that time to save trouble for the uncle later. But yeah, I don't disclose in the first place and if I have to then I give a very low figure. Huh never said that's my salary, that's what my company pays for Masters graduates, it's really the market rate especially if you're from ISI Bangalore üíÄ Atleast ghante ka kitna toh nahin puchte women too!! Tell them an insane number like 2-3 Cr. they will happily tell u incl encashed leave and what da they receive and how the indian govt fleece them Our society needs at least few more generations to mature and learn some basic manners and boundaries. mumbai too Then good for ISI peeps. Tbh I dont care so much kitna mil rha inko Indians in general lack boundaries. Commenting on salary, job, weight, childlessness, skin color, hair etc. is fairly normal. I have to cultivate inner fortitude for about 4 months every time I visit family back home. I‚Äôm not kidding. In India nobody is taught what is basic etiquette in conversation. Parents dont have the time in such a competitive society to impart this knowledge and the less said the better about schools. Ye reddit par nai bolna tha üíÄ Now turn off dms for your own sanity I ask my dad the same thing. I tell him my friends dad's are making so much more what are you doing. The best way to deal with this is ask the uncle how much he is earning or how much savings he has. And then non chalantly tell them all your friends dad make more than them or have more savings than them. We should hit them back at the same place they try to hit us lol. This is what I do whenever my dad asks me why I am earning less or some bullshit in this regards. I tell him modi a chaiwala has become the president and is earning crores everyday what are you doing. And then I can also feel pity for them for such a sad situation: ‚ÄúUncle despite 30 years of experience you could only save this much‚Äù. Look at Sharma uncle ji who invested in plots and he‚Äôs worth this much. I usually do the other way. I dont like anybody gauging my financial ability. If i make 40LPA, i would say 25LPA. Just go with 1 Cr as base and add there is variable component of 20% to 90% stocks I face this often. I‚Äôve stopped giving them numbers. Worst case scenario, give them a deflated number. Saves you from nazarüßø For some reason I read this in South Indian accent in my head. I can proudly say that I can refuse to answer such question with no hesitation to ignore further inquiries What is this CTC term ? Don‚Äôt over inflate. Make your self poor. Then they won‚Äôt ask you for money. Say that after the promotion I get 10 lacs! With a beaming smile. They‚Äôll slowly slink away Honestly, I fucking hate such uncles. Similar to your story, some uncle asked me about my salary at that time and I hesitantly told him 30LPA(which is decent for 2yoe). But this uncle mocked me that it‚Äôs so low and what‚Äôs the point of so much of your education. I was also furious that my dad didn‚Äôt told anything to him and just told me to tell the inflated numbers from next time. From then on, I have stopped telling people my CTC unless they are my good friends. It‚Äôs good to discuss CTC with your peer group in a healthy way so that you are aware of market trends but I am not revealing actual numbers to any uncle. I just brush off the topic or if they insist too much, I tell them an inflated number. Funny that Indian redditors feel only uncle and aunties are doing that. Just go on most Indian subs and they are talking about salaries almost everyday. There is not much difference but yet uncles and aunties would be made fun of while it should be other way around at least they are asking known people you guys are shamelessly asking random strangers over internet. Stop shaming oldies when you are doing the exact same thing in a different setting and yet you will have a non sense defense for it. My family members used to do this until I started making more money than them. Surprise, they never asked again! Whenever they ask always say, i do well for myself. When they asl but how much, say, good enough. When they insist, say your company has made ur sign an NDA and it would land you in trouble if you give details. > tactics men employ. people who complain about ctc gossip are usually well earning individuals. People who live paycheck to paycheck don't care to post about this gossip because they are insecure about their income levels. that is so true. Bhai shaadi ke baad bhi some will crib about how the wife snatched away her son. I am like aunty bada ho gya hai beta , sax karne ki umar ho gyi hai karne do bhai . yes. LPA- Lakhs Per Anum. 40 LPA is equivalent of $47,607.68 USD, which is like earning $172,875 in Los Angeles. (PPP conversion) When I started earning, I had 6 lpa and my father's friend had 12 lpa so I got constant reminders that I was a failure. Now they don't know what I earn and never will, only people who should be aware of your salary are your colleagues and significant other. Easy - lie This is the way. I've done this and then enjoyed not budging as they pressed again and again, their faces becoming visibly uncomfortable. Then they start sharing numbers of other people to goad me, to which I say \"bohat accha uncle\". I quote a number based on what I think, they think of me. Which usually isn't too much! And the conversation ends up at - \"Koi ni beta, aaj kal market kharab h\". All uncles are also matchmakers. So they are trying ti judge your market value in shaadi market. Sundar pitchai's father isn't happy either. lmao the timing of this post is exactly on the day i got placed in campus interview. This happens to me. When no one is around me my mama(with a smiling face) comes n asks me \"kitna hua increment\" and I'm always uncomfortable sharing. He keeps on asking till I give him the number.Any suggestions on how to avoid.Due to this I hate going to family functions . Don‚Äôt you mean prime minister lol. Typical Indian Unkil or Aunti whose highest point in their entire lifetime was to make a kid and shove all their hopes and dreams into them. People like these are usually sad really. Just shatter their perspective like you thought you‚Äôd do by giving an inflated number, works the best. They stop asking. Or, just say mahine k 3 iPhone ajate hai. Oh yeah. Edited the comment thanks lol. Plz have balls to say ‚Äò‚Äôit‚Äôs personal uncle, I am very happy with what I am making‚Äù that‚Äôs it!!! If he insists, just move to diff convo. Well.. in future if someone asks you about your CTC and you are left with no choice but to answer them you can just try saying \"enough to live comfortably\" with a little smile so that it can make you seem not too rude also you will not be revealing facts about the paycheck. It worked for me might come in handy for you too and even after answering their question if they are still being Persistent and want to know the exact number..hey 40 LPA is a great number if you are working in INDIA or as you said inflate the number soo high they start questioning their own existence. Ladki hoke aise bol sakte hain kya? üò≠üòÇ Dude, my manager asked me ‚Äòwhat‚Äô I am on my first day. I‚Äôm an advocate. Working in corp law üò≠ü•∞ you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be more aware/ sensitive considering their education and field of work but nope, definitely not the case lol Not even them, only you and Him. Their is the last generation _ have fun. They will be extinct soon Its weird i already know this trick‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ in my case it was college marks. In general people at least in the same field should talk about CTC often. That's how you know how much more you can ask the company. !?! Really? Only a few tier 1 mba and eng colleges can provide close to that for their flagship course Currently , on paper 10 lakh Indians make over 50 lakh yearly and that includes non salaried professionals who would def be making the majority of this number. So roughly 5-6 lakh salaried individuals r above that figure , again, majority of those would be having a lot more than just 6 years exp Bolna hota hai bas dal roti chalrhi, this is the way. >people saying I was offended , Nope I wasn't Honestly I would he offended. I would've worked 6 years to reach there and this uncle is lying to show off. Even top colleges in India does not have 40LPA overall average package. (I would've said that to his face frankly if I were you) Every situation doesn't need a comeback...a polite walkaway is better. Always be respectful even if the other isn't specially if they are older i quote 5 lpa that too gets deducted after tax soo 3 lpa uncleüòÖüòÇ. So that i can be sure that they never come to ask for money. Always say low, my dad thought me that My standard response is ‚Äúmore than your illegitimate son‚Äù does. That usually forces the moti aunties gathered around to faint and I walk away pleased He lied for the same reasons you did, and similar reasons as you plan to next time. Perpetuating the cycle and complaining about it. Fascinating. Hey how did you got that much salary ? I did this a couple times (a bit more respectfully obv) and now nobody asks about my pay anymore. I'd say it's a win Just have the balls to say \"none of your business\". If our generation can't say it, this shit will never end. My trick is say something around 1.4LPA. Its barely 10k in hand lol‚Ä¶this way you both are happy! Dude, I don't know why things like this are contests. This was in 2014, not so much domestic air connectivity as today and before I was leaving for US for my MS. Before leaving the town this Uncle called me to visit his family and I went. While speak we spoke about my travel arrangements, date etc. I got to know that the Uncle's son(similar in my age) is also going to VIT(Vellore one) for Masters. I congratulated him and we moved on with conversation. The next day I received a call from the Uncle and we spoke for a bit. And he not so casually mentions that his son is leaving for his masters on a plane and that too a week before me. So he will have his first plane ride before me. For the express purpose of flying, he and his family went to bigger metro 6 hrs away by train. Never ask a Man His Wage and Women her Age. It gets worse when you realize it‚Äôs really a sons d!ck measuring contest. Lmao my sons pp is bigger than your sons pp ü§£ They don't care about being politically correct. They don't think it's an offensive question. Does this uncle have a beautiful daughter? Then definitely go for 1 Cr To inhand bara kar bol de.. bas uncle ki bolti bandh.. Try backanswering with \"Tumhaari beti se shaadi karwaani hain....?\" I dont think they mean to be crude, unless of course they are Sharma ji and they compare beta's ctc to yours You should say 60LPA \\[haath me 25\\] that amount would shut up most.. It works for me.. Na man that's too much.. Out of experience let me tell you. The uncle would have flaunted his son‚Äôs CTC if that would have been more than yours üòÇ I always prefer to quote a much lower number. Totally relatable, it is so frustrating to deal. Happens with me in flights as well. Inki mkc I answer like this .. gujara ho jata hai by Indian uncles and aunties you basically mean everyone lol. our gen has learnt the concept of privacy, they apparently never did 1st of all placements are shit this year everywhere and no way ISI Bangalore avg salary is 40 LPA. I had hired from ISI Kolkata in 2022 and 2023, and we paid 18 LPA. So ur uncle is bluffing. Lol you should've asked whether he had a fight with aunty These are the kinds of uncles who work as a clerk in some shitty government office for 20k pm and are the reason why getting any government work takes so much time I was like you. Then I noticed how people started taking advantage of me knowing i have money. Now my answer to how much i earn: I am unemployed. Sthan ya dhan? Wait does this really works do these annoying people eventually stop asking such questions Btw nice username üòÑ I am a poha lover too Indians usually don‚Äôt have any civic sense and don‚Äôt respect any boundaries It is just to troll him. Why do you think you are liable to tell the truth It came hell more creeper when u told u are a married woman like wtf don't these uncles think ur husband would best the shit out of them if they talk to u like this,leave that also u are a grown up person and one can't talk to a person like this Age-old wisdom from my grand parents to my parents and then to me : Never disclose your salary. Stuffs I say when someone asks: 1. Bas guzara ho jata h aur kuch bach jata h 2. well off for every day life 3. Industry standard, (I am in tech) jitna 2-3 saal ke experience me milta h logo ko. If they insist, I asked point blank: Aap to eise pooch rahe ho jaise rista karane wale ho.. Nobody except my manager and coworkers know my CTC. I always avoid giving a number They do that to people whi are not related to them, mere.se poocha tha ek baar, maine bas ye bola ki kyu uncle apni beti byahne ki soch rahe kya, meri to shaadi ho gayi kisi aur se pooch lo. He got very angry.... Their kids learn the same and the cycle continues. TBH always share your salary with uncle aunty whatever. And share it without any pride or shame, Indians already have too many stigmas around money Or Agee jada noisy hai to samajh jao they are not good people and avoid them, but reddit pe aake apne low agency hone ka pardarshan mat karo Quote an absurd number next time. Bold of you to assume, things have changed. We are still very judgemental society. Not sure whether to feel good or bad for you. If you are getting good treatment, enjoy. But, I personally feel is bad, treating people based on their earning potential. The reason, is if things go south, these would generally be the first person in line to bad mouth you as well. Most of the people especially relatives get happy, if you're not on their level. Not just uncle's bro aunties too .all relatives are like this . Hell even my parents are too . Now What do parents do with these details? they torture us with the \"Sharma ji ka beta 300000 rupay kama leta hai tu toh 300 ka ek din me kha lete ho sharam karo\". Its like a stress relief for them to nag at us 1)Find a simple reason to yell at your child . 2)Yell at your child . 3)If child rebels Say the dialogue\"We are all working hard for your sake \" . 4)Happy sleep for them . Op the link says 2021-2022 highest is 21 lpa. Are u guys getting paid 40lpa in India? Holy shit!! I'll just tell them I'm unemployed and see their reaction.... To such questions i always answer ‚Äúguzara chal jata hai‚Äù they immediately know to back off .. but then there are some who will put a number like 50k per month to mil jata hoga na to which i respond han itna to hai .. so basically you didn‚Äôt tell them the real number and said yes to their quotes figures so probably giving them the satisfaction ki chalo kam hi kama rahe hain hmse / hmare bachho se !! Which in my opinion is much better than getting evil eyes ! A better answer will be Uncle itna mil jata hai ki aapse help lene ke liye aana nahin parta Kabhi zarurat hua to aapke pass hi aunga Learn to say No. Simple. Grammatical mistake: Asking about the CTC, not \"for\". It's not something you can give or do for them. Ahh the great Indian parenting saga, my mom still compares how kids younger than me are married and have offspring and how I failed them even though they indeed provided me all the support to be successful. I don't even feel bad about myself but for my mother as it's nearly impossible to change her point of view, which is tangled with society's expectations and never ending path to content. I mean look at Americans, they retire, sell off their big house, move to a small one so that they can travel around the world. My grandfather, he gets a pension from the army, money from agriculture activities, rent from the shops and at 80 money is still on his mind, same goes for my father and sadly for me as well. Our whole 3rd generation just has money in our mind Don't inflate the number. Deflate it. a lot. you should have said 10LPA, and very proudly. Now he will brag about his son getting 20LPA, and also start pitying you. But you can be laughing inside, because you know the truth. ‚ÄòBas ghar chal jata hai Uncle‚Äô - you have to say only this I do exactly the opposite, I deflate the salary and say it. For example, Random Uncle (RU): How is your job? How much do you earn? Me: 1.3L per month(Any number between 1.2-1.5) RU: Bangalore is expensive right? Or are you planning to buy a home?. Me: I don't have any savings, 50k goes into rent, maid, bills etc. Another 70k for groceries, outings and travels to functions like these. RU looks at me with such disappointment for getting this after 10+ years and a very good college. Sometimes they give suggestions. RU: Why don't you try learning XYZ or do certification or go to the US, or join ABC company, etc? Me: I need to work extra time for that, If I move to a different company or the US I need to work harder. I can't and don't want to work hard. I am happy with what I am getting. RU thinks I have gone nuts and either gets a call or changes the topic. I am happy, that he will not bring up this topic again with me or ask me to help his neighbours cousins son to find a job, who has completed BCom and wants to work in AI. To Humble You I didnt ask for your emotional response. It was just sharing a particular experience. Earning potential had nothing to do with his response, he was happy that his daughter was secure although she had a fairly secure PSU job and income which was pensionable. Also the person is a traditionalist; will never bad mouth the damaad unless I have done something criminal. Also relatives dont give a damn of where u are in life unless u are living with your extended family in a ghetto I have an MBA - working at one of the largest MNCs in India - 2.7 LPA. An MBA doesn't guarantee high package, the college you graduate from makes all the difference. What line of work are you in Bob? You seem about just as fragile about this as your uncles. >An MBA doesn't guarantee high package neither does a master's degree and 6 years of experience. In other news, the sky is still blue. What line of work are you in tho? True, the initial comment above was a little ignorant on my part. I work in auditing, specifically IT auditing at a Big4. Isn't 2.7 really low for even after an MBA degree? I did my BCA and my friends who opened for placements were getting average 4lpa... I'm guessing you're not in the IT field. Tier 1 MBA colleges have an average of 25+lpa tho Bhai, agli baar koi CTC pooche toh 500 ka note nikalna, aur use aag laga dena uske saamne. Gand fat jaegi uski. Devesh Dixit ka recommended hai. I usually say an average salary since I don't bother nor care what uncles, aunties or my next door nosey neighbor think! I grew up in the U.S., so I tell them \"it's rude to ask about salaries in my culture.\" They never know what to say, lol. India is the most judgmental country on the planet. I love India. Even despite this problem it is my favorite country. I have traveled all over the world. However, this is a good thing. Everyone needs to be intrusive and know how much money everyone is making. It only helps the 0.1% and hurts 99.9. This is how two people working the same job at the same company can get half the salary of the other one. This is how you can earn 50% of what you should be earning in your field, bc you didn't know. Yeah the comments and judgment are absolutely disgusting but i would rather have everyone being paid fairly. Just counter them and ask them how much money they have in savings My answer was always ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù You are not far from truth. That uncle died one year later. I am like, me exact figure nahi bata sakta. App batao aap kitna kamate ho then I will tell you if it is more or less. That really shuts them up. Plus, I am known to be very straightforward, so folks in my family don't ask dumb questions to me. I'm wondering what would happen if OP had told random uncle \"I'm not comfortable discussing that\" concept of privacy? were 1.4 billion people produced from intercourses that happened openly in public? do people in your family expect you to change your cloths or shower while they are watching? Do they ask you to share your password or private diary or online journal? Aukaat naapne ke liye. why can you explain the context behind that? I give contradictory answers. Example ‚Äúeven my father has no idea, do you think I will tell you?‚Äù And then not a single word coming out of their mouth. I‚Äôm 5.4‚Äô ft in height so some uncles be like my son is younger but taller than you and I answer them ‚Äúmeasure how much we grew mentally not physically ‚Äú and pin drop silent üòÇ I think you have to give savage answers that they never dare to ask such questions. Peace ‚úåüèª You know Indian society was poor in the last generation, so money matters a lot. And a person feels great if his son/daughter make good money as compare to kids of his peers. The previous generation outlook couldn't evolve beyond a narrow spectrum unfortunately. What‚Äôs CTC ? Indian uncles are anything but who we are today, they despise us, are jealous of us. May be they have daughters they are just looking for a wealthy groom Total compensation Didn‚Äôt knew builders also practiced caste system for selling new projects? üò≠ Indian parents life is all about comparasion. This sole behaviour makes them miser, since someone will always be at better place than you. This behaviour also makes one to take silly financial decisions like taking home loan when one is not really needed. Home is important but with planning. My pops became sad after placement cause my best friend got 52 lpa package, and I could only get 20. Still he says to me \"kuch to kamk reh gayi hogi\". I do appreciate his hardwork for me throughout his life, but this comparasion mindset of our society ü§°. plan is to silence not create more questions My friend used to dodge this question by saying ‚Äú not enough ‚Äú which I think is perfect On the face reply with a smile \"How does it matter how much I earn, anyway I am not going to give you a single paisa from it\" So they can ensure their son/daughter make more than you avg salary is not a good indicator. median salary is a better indicator for a college placement. Thanks üôèüèª So you can say 'mind your own business' or 'f*ck off' if you are sanskaari enough Jhaat pooche to bolo katuaa I too used to face same question long ago and as I didn't want reveal my CTC/salary amount with my relatives/acquittances, I have figured out replies. One of the reply I tell them is 'Uparwala ki meharbani hai'. Second is 'bas uncle guzar basar ho jata hai', although we both know I earn decent money (by the grace of god) but they would never know exact amount. yes. learn the sublime art of telling but not revealing. it will come in handy with HR, family, friends, girl friends. and one night in the dark, when no one is around, tell yourself how much you earn to yourself! You should always reply with bas roti pani ka kharcha nikal jaata h uncle üòä It is very simple. They want to know so that they can compare it with their kids and prepare their kids to compete. \"Dekho sharma ki ladka aaj kitna kama raha hai\", for this one activity. I always tell them the thrice of my salary so they never dare to ask and never try to compete. May be he is doing market analysis like you can do anonymously , but he doesn't know how to use reddit. It's generation thing. May be he is not personal , but also happy for you . I am not sure his intentions were not to hurt you, but you did had bad intentions. So what's exactly the difference here ? Just because someone is asking your salary doesnt mean you need to let them know, just deny, plain and simple. You are absolutely right man, some motherfuckers in this society will even try to say lies in order to match a more successful person in conversation, like what the fuck man you have become a fucking 40 year old person and rather than being wise you are trying to protect your so called reputation by lying? People just don't realise that the person in front of them has worked really hard to achieve their level. ü§£üëç Correct !! Bhai kya bolte ho aap? When people ask‚Ä¶? Always lowball such questions, I feel it just gives people a sense of achievement and no harm is done. Wait what ? How were my intentions bad ? He asked mine , I asked about his son's . Instead of giving me the straight answer he just played around with words . Naah he has 2 sons , none are gay Correction‚Ä¶ father is retiring. It‚Äôs not ‚Äútoday morning‚Äù. It‚Äôs ‚Äúthis morning‚Äù. Life is too short to argue about money. Just say, \"Aapse matlab?\" and move on. Just ask them to mind their own effing business. I would really be annoyed if somebody asked me this question Maybe just say 'enough'. Remember that meme: to kamao na bh****K? Tab seedha vinaybhang chillaneka, permanently chup hojayenge Suggestion (and what I do during this scenario). My conversation with uncles/aunties goes like this -- Them: \"Kitna salary milta hai ?\" Me \"Aapko kya lagta hai ?\" Them: \"Humko kya pata ? Tum batao kita hai ?\" Me\" \"To bhi, kya lagta hai aapko kitna milta hoga mujhe ?\" At this point they might say some figure. Say \"Yes\" to whatever they say and move on. Huh I always do the opposite, give them a super low number. They are always happy to hear that their son/daughter make a lot more. Win win Because Indian culture does not comprehend boundaries. Remember when they ask your salary, they are judging how much respect they should give you Main core Ahmedabad mai rehta hun. Maine to yey sab nahi dekha. *Mere khud Ghar Mai rehta hun lekin üíÄ I have never seen anyone put it as well as you do. Of course, they ask.. to be nosey. Can't do anything about it. Just ask them \"CTC Matlab\" and then use that time to think of a way to take the conversation to a tangent. \"Bas kharcha paani nikalte jata hai\" works too, but sometimes they come back with \"phir Bhi\". You can say dekhiye uncle, ambani Bhi woi gehun ka roti khataa hai.. aap aur hum bhi.. sab moh maaya hai. Pro tip: Tackling uncles can teach you skills MBA courses cannot. whataboutism I suppose you're right Uncle ke life kuch jaat nahi chal raha isliye Smile and say ‚Äú kaam chal jaata hai‚Äù .. or ‚ÄúI get by ok‚Äù version in your local language. It‚Äôs another modern Indian habit of being intrusive and weirdly competitive. Indian society needs to reestablish personal boundaries on politics, salaries and religion One of the best joys in adult life is to dole out advice (even if it‚Äôs for the best of intentions). But that‚Äôs the way to dodge it - inflate your numbers. You hired M.Stat folks ? [A reality check for people like you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ahmedabad/s/wtqPsNhdM1)"
