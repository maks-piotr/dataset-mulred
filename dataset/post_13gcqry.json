The risky ones have to undergo the tests every year. \nThe key personnel have to give an undertaking before they can move into these roles which have access to state secrets.  The primary clauses mention that you can't talk to media, or publish books or articles pertaining to the work done at the organisation. But hidden in the fine print is one clause which specifically states that the phone conversation will be under surveillance. \n\n\nBad apples do get through like in the current case. \n\nBut overall the set up is much more secure now than what it was in pre-2016 era. Earlier the security was more like a formality which needs to be done in letter and not in spirit. Now it's followed strictly and whenever deviations are found the senior officers are marched off without delay or deliberations.  A few examples of such removals  were made and now everyone has fallen in line.\n\nI had a colleague who's wife worked in XXXX, Deonar, Mumbai.

There's division of labour yes, but there's no myth-building around male supremacy or the enshrined supremacy of men.\n\nPatriarchy is largely a feature of agrarian societies.",

No man ever controlled a woman or another man because they couldn't control themselves rather men did it because they thought they were superior and stronger than others whether in terms of physique, wealth or influence. They can but only if the society agrees, otherwise u can't call urself lonely I am pretty sure nudes weren't the only thing, he was also looking for interaction with this woman. Which is why things like onlyfans are so popular lol, even when u have entire internet full of porn but people happily pay for onlyfans , fansly and all because they can interact with these pornstars Do we really know the person sending nudes was a woman? Could have been a 40 year old person pretending to be a woman, fake nudes arent exactly difficult to generate . Peshwas collapsed for a hole. What's DRDO!! Wait till you hear about that guy in the US who leaked defense information on a gaming server Demn! Chut ka chakkar babu bhaiya No, if you read evolutionary biology and primatology, mate-guarding is a salient feature of the majority of human societies, as well as some primate groups. Since human females have evolved to have concealed ovulation and ovulate across the year, unlike other primates that are in estrus once or twice a year, human males could not determine paternity until the advent of DNA testing. Establishing paternity became critically important when human beings moved from hunter-gatherer societies to settled agriculture, because settled agriculture enshrined private property, required surplus labour, and was critically dependent on male strength because food-growing is physically strenuous. If you read anthropology, patriarchy is not as structured or well-established in hunter-gatherer societies. There's division of labour yes, but there's no myth-building around male supremacy or the enshrined supremacy of men. Patriarchy is largely a feature of agrarian societies. Elaborate pls. I don't believe it send me the link of the nude pictures , I'll 'analyse' those myself He could've paid for onlyfans lmfao, also prostitution is a thing too.
