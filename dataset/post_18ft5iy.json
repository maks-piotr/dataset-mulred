        "Just suggesting, try Amul choclates.\n\nYou get an entire big sized Bar for 100 bucks (Dark Chocolate) & Fruit'N'Nut for the same or 125 bucks.",
        "Cadbury has been bought out by Mondelez. it’s no longer the same chocolate :(",
        "Same with our beloved Parle-G.  \nSoon, they will just show you a photo of Dairy milk for ₹5.",
        "Yes that's what I buy usually but for kids small ones are better which are sadly unavailable in market.",
        "why tf would i pay ₹8337 for a bar of dark chocolate?",
        "That happened back in 2010",
        "Maybe I've grown up but Cadbury just doesn't taste as good \n\nI always go for amul chocolate nowadays",
        "Papaji, bucks bolke kool sound karna zaroori hunda si.",
        "Just write rupees man \nHow hard is that",
        "Yeah, I just bought a whole bunch of packets of Happy Happy after a long time and the extremely small size of the packet was the first thing I noticed. The ₹5 ParleG seems to have shrunk to the level ₹2 ParleG that we used to get.",
        "RIP to us all",
        "Just assume Rupees Dude. How troublesome is that?",
        "Panch rupai Mai factory dendega kya /s",
        "Nah bro, im just sayin it's convenient to write rupees since we live in India \nAlso bucks just mean dollars, so it's kinda trippy",
        "Milkybar jitna ho jayega dheere dheere",
        "Exactly, when I bought the bought ₹5 pack, I actually gave it back thinking the shopkeeper had given me ₹2 pack.  \nAnd that ₹2 pack is complete joke.",
        "Wich one",
        "The exact same chocolate tastes so much better in European countries. Also go to any Supermarket shelf or a kirana store( they'll always have those coolers that Cadbury gives them so no other brand is present) \n\nIt is disheartening to see an almost Mondelez  monopoly everywhere.\n\nI agree Amul's chocolates are much better.",
        "75%",
        "I didn't think production was fully converted until more recently though?",
        "tastes absolutely shit",
        "I will not financially recover from this",
        "Where’s the surprise? What does ₹5 buy you today? If you expect a quality product to be sold anywhere near that price, the expectation is the issue, not the fact that you’ll be disappointed.",
        "Bhai muje to Kinder Joy khana hai fir usse nikle toy se kheluga 2 din.",
        "It didn't become Mondelez until 2018. Kraft Foods bought Cadbury's back in 2010 and renamed the confectionery business as Mondelez in 2018",
        "Wash your hands bro",
        "pls tell me you have gigantic hands",
        "in next 5 years they will let you dip tip of your finger in the chocolate for 5 rupee and you can suck on that",
        "It's good to see we still get something for Rs. 5",
        "Rupees dude rupees it's only 100-125 rupees",
        "Yup, it's all sugar and nothing else.",
        "BRO, its 5 Rupees?? What did you expect??",
        "It's not the size but how you enjoy it. I hope 🥲",
        "Exactly!!!!!, When i was like 11, i told my cousin grandparents that the price of the chocolate was same but the size of the chocolate was decreasing, eg: size of 10 rupees cadbury like a year ago was costing 20 rupees now!, they laughed at me for having a strong memory. But i told them it was because of the decreasing purchasing power of money (I learned it from a cartoon in disney xd back then)",
        "Just few weeks back it was double the size.",
        "Oh yeah, Kraft was bought by Mondelez a while ago but they apparently didn't quite finish the merger until recently (and I think some of this has included consolidating production, because the UK's Cadburys only went to shit in the past few years). Thanks",
        "They aren't dirty. I was brown with this brownish skin color shade.",
        "No bro small hands.",
        "Amul has supply chain issues?  \nI thought they haven't been able to market their product well. I bought it for my cousin on her birthday and she likes it better than Cadbury. So, I guess they do have a superior product at relatively lower price point but just need to redo their \"Utterly butterly delicious Amul\" charm.",
        "Cadbury (high priced sugar bar) doesn't taste as good since I started sugar abstinence few years back. It has worked wonders for my gut and reduced my cravings.  \nI use choco powder and milk for my cravings (at times).",
        "This looks great actually. I wish I could get that quantity of chocolate where I live. Wouldn't feel as guilty and also indulge myself once in a while.",
        "I feel this way with good day biscuits",
        "Anyone bought Happy Happy biscuits recently?",
        "In some years, for 5 rs may be you will be allowed to get a whiff of the chocolate bar.",
        "Why not increase the price? Why shrink??",
        "But Cadbury lost it's original taste and style like i still remember the original packaging and current one and the taste man things have changed are at worst place now in my heart",
        "You have big hands bro 😎",
        "Yea and for chocolate to be beneficial it needs to be atleast 60% cocoa",
        "It's more than average, it's huge",
        "Us",
        "Amul does not have supply chain issues. They've not been able to over throw cadbury as a player. Their issue is marketing. If they ever bothered to move away from just marketing their butter and concentrating on chocolate, they'd be able to make a move.",
        "Wait till you see it IRL. 😂\nIt's looking huge in picture only.",
        "Cadbury has changed its recipe for India. They're selling the American recipe here. Like someone else mentioned, their european, middle eastern and singaporean version tastes like what it used to in the 90s and 2000s. But that has higher concentration of coco and cadbury is trying to be cheap with us.",
        "Can confirm it tastes different in US as well.",
        "Gone Mads have shrunk in size too :/",
        "The bigger issue is the plastic wrapper which adds to the rubbish in the environment. Even if you collect that and dump in landfill, it will fly away with wind making even more mess and adding to plastic pollution. :/",
        "Same. Its just too much sugar now, no other taste to savour.",
        "Indians eat too much candy anyway",
        "ITT: People not knowing how inflation works",
        "Winter is here 🥶",
        "Umm. His hands look spotless?",
        "Ye kam package wali taste less lagti hai vahi ham jara pricy khaye tohh acchi lagti hai kuch tohh gadbad hai bhai",
        "Same, growing up my taste for chocolates has changed too. I prefer dark chocolates over milk chocolates now.",
        "I remember the old days wen I was in school, my mom use to pack my snack with parleG which was shared among two other siblings. The size of them compared to current ones...... I should say inflation ?",
        "Which is absolute garbage!!",
        "Are you sure your hands haven't grown?",
        "Coz India is an extremely price-sensitive market and multinational brands cannot afford to not play at the lowest price point. Else they will lose the rural markets to local players. That’s the same reason why Lays keep their 5 rupees packs live.",
        "Exactly dude. Post covid itself we have seen most goods and services double or even triple in price. And folks here are expecting 5 INR Cadbury to be of the same size as 1990s is just ridiculous. Not sure why you got downvoted lol.",
        "Accidental hand reveal lol",
        "Why is it disheartening to see Mondelez products being widely sold? Super curious of your reasons behind it. They invested in infrastructure at retailer-level to enable optimal storage and deliver a great product to the consumer. And they are winning. What’s wrong? \n\nThere’s no monopoly look at our retailers lol. Coke/Pepsi invest money and provide them with huge coolers to store their product and our guys stuff it with milk/dahi/what not. That’s a terrible thing to do and every other sales rep struggles with this on market visits.\n\nGoing through these comments reaffirms the widely documented consumer research lol. We Indian consumers want big chocolates with questionable taste, quality controls, ingredients, at throwaway prices.",
        "Intentional hai, mujhe pichle janam me ek shrap laga tha. Kal raat sapne me bhagwaan ne bola apna hath logo ko dikhana, tere paap unpe chale jayenge.\n\nThanks Bhai.",
        "Accha he bhagwan ne sirf hath dikhane ka bola bhai  💀",
        "> Cadbury has changed its recipe for India\n\nIt's majority sugar! I tried the Old Gold brand of Cadbury made in Australia and found it so much better!",
        "Feels weird for me to even eat chocolate now. Be it cheap or costly.",
        "I miss the one with chocolate wrapped in gold foil. It tasted better too.",
        "Better taste",
        "Isn't Rs 5 equal 0.06 cents in the US? You guys get an entire chocolate bar for 6 cents? Small or not that nuts!",
        "> Lays\n\nYou mean airbags?",
        "I've been aware of shrinkflation at Japanese markets but never expected to see it here although Japanese markets are dominated by domestic players but why do they do that?",
        "Soon they will make you lick a paper strip sprayed with chocolate for 5 rs.",
        "Amuls chocolate is alright. I had theirs dark coco too but I prefer Lindtt.",
        "Inflation, value of 5 rupees has gone down hence they need to reduce the size",
        "Have y’all seen munch and gonemad? Munch tho it’s reduced size but gonemad😂😂 they have the same size but reduced chocolate",
        "Wonder if there are websites tracking Shrinkflation of other products? \n\nA Rs 2 Nescafe sachet now only has half the powder..",
        "Dairy milk just tastes like oil and sugar with sprinkled cocoa. Not my go to anymore.",
        "Amul chocolate tastes foul and is almost inedible lol",
        "Miles better than Cadbury for me",
        "How? It’s literally just a bar of solid oil! No chocolate taste at all! Is this some sort of weird contrarianism?",
        "Some damn good tasting oil then and my biggest gripe with Cadbury _is_ that it's too sweet and tastes more like coco milk mix than actual chocolate.\n\nand I am definitely not a contrarian because I am a big hater of that behaviour myself. I just prefer one to another man, amul's not my favourite or anything too.",
        "I guess taste is subjective. What one person finds delicious another person will find disgusting",
        "Its winter so shrinking is normal",
        "the 100Rs. dairy milk was out of stock for some time and returned with 117Rs.",
        "Cuz Cadbury milk chocolate has more sugar in proportion to cocoa while amul chocolate has more cocoa than sugar . \nso you like  diabetes rich chocolate ig",
        "Bro back in our days 5 rs chocolate was in size of today's 20 rs chocolate.",
        "That's why I don't buy Cadbury shit. \nFor me it's amul and bournvile chocolates . Simple as that.",
        "Mondelez sells poor quality chocolate \nBelgian cheap chocolate is better than anything Cadbury puts out at any price level",
        "Bournville is also a Cadbury product.",
        "What Amul chocolate did you find oil in?? Almost all their dark chocolates exclusively use cocoa butter. Amul is the only food company in India that actively campaigns against the use of Palm oil and vegetable oil. Their Ice Creams are also the only ones in India that doesn't use Vegetable oil",
        "I stopped buying Cadbury after amul gave dark chocolate for ₹25 .",
        "If its their bitter chocolate or dark chocolate, that isnt true. Its mostly coco solids.",
        "I won’t be surprised if they come up with an advert, linking cut and bury to show amul chocolate triumph after that",
        "Same man. I've stopped eating cadbury but that extra chocolate one is fine. And also dark chocolate in Amul. These are only things I eat, rarely",
        "Amul chocolate has no real cocoa lol. Just a block of sugar and melted milk powder. Only 70% and above says cocoa solids but those are too bitter.\n\nMy favourite is bournville 70%. Super yummy with real cocoa and not at all bitter.",
        "Agreed Amul chocolates are leagues better than cadbury.especially the cadbury in India. Its the marketing that they need to work on.",
        "Please talk about shrinkflation also , not only on taste .",
        "It actually is just palm oil with sugar,\n\nAmul Dark chocolates🤌🏻>>Bournville >> shit milk"

Bhai muje to Kinder Joy khana hai fir usse nikle toy se kheluga 2 din. It didn't become Mondelez until 2018.

BRO, its 5 Rupees?? What did you expect?? It's not the size but how you enjoy it. I hope 🥲 Exactly!!!!!, When i was like 11, i told my cousin grandparents that the price of the chocolate was same but the size of the chocolate was decreasing, eg: size of 10 rupees cadbury like a year ago was costing 20 rupees now!, they laughed at me for having a strong memory.

I bought it for my cousin on her birthday and she likes it better than Cadbury.

Wouldn't feel as guilty and also indulge myself once in a while. I feel this way with good day biscuits Anyone bought Happy Happy biscuits recently? In some years, for 5 rs may be you will be allowed to get a whiff of the chocolate bar. Why not increase the price? Why shrink?? But Cadbury lost it's original taste and style like i still remember the original packaging and current one and the taste man things have changed are at worst place now in my heart You have big hands bro 😎 Yea and for chocolate to be beneficial it needs to be atleast 60% cocoa It's more than average, it's huge Us Amul does not have supply chain issues. They've not been able to over throw cadbury as a player. Their issue is marketing.

Agreed Amul chocolates are leagues better than cadbury.especially the cadbury in India. Its the marketing that they need to work on. Please talk about shrinkflation also , not only on taste . It actually is just palm oil with sugar, Amul Dark chocolates🤌🏻>>Bournville >> shit milk"
