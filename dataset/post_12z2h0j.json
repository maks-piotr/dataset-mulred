        "Really disappointed with my company. \n\nI joined as a graphic design intern for 10k pm; their offer for full-time was 25k pm. \n\nI was a professional photographer earlier so they also utilised my skills to do a corporate video shoot as well as edit it. \n\nI've made graphic design social media posts, shot these videos professionally and edited them as well, made some motion graphics storyboard changes, and some other inhouse works. \n\nAll this was in my intern time and this month they said they're making me full time. \n\nThe issue is, the offer from their side is 15k. Which is very  disrespectful.\n\nI moved out of my house and live alone and have pushed myself totally in these 3 months. I survived on 10k without any issue because I was looking forward to becoming full time. Their offer really surprised me. Who increases 5k and says it's full-time?\n\nAnd this underpay is very common in many of these art firms. \nThey try to undermine you, make you work more but pay less. \n\nTerms like, \"we're a team\", \"I'm providing you a system\". Is all bs. \n\n\nLuckily I've an offer from another company, which is paying me 30k minimum for only graphic design works. \n\nI'm really shifting to that place or will find other places rather than staying here for the underpay and being undermined subtly. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Let me know.",

Somehow I screwed it up, she said no and went out with another guy. Fast forward she just got married to that guy, **and joined my freaking company and the SAME FUCKING TEAM.** FUCK ME. JUST FUCK ME. I Hate it, I can't stand to see her laughing and smiling, I know its not her fault. Every time I think what could I possibly do different few years ago. My confidence is completely shattered. I can't even quit the job, because it's rare to get an equivalent job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had to wish her the day she got married as the whole team wished her, one of the worst days in my life so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore people say go to gym to boost confidence, I literally do, I am very athletic and also do gym, I ran a marathon recently as well. It doesn't work, it doesn't help. I don't even know what to do, don't have any siblings, parents are really old. I don't think I even have the confidence to ask out any other girl anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone said time will fix it, but time just makes it worse, I don't even find any other girls attractive anymore.  It's been 4 months since she joined and I feel like puking every time I see her laughing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYaar me karo to kya karu...."
