    "selftext": "I shifted at a new place a few days ago and there is this house near our building. Every night we hear a voice of a puppy crying. It would cry all night. This video was shot today morning and it was raining at the night. I asked my roommate if the puppy's owner was abusive but she told she never saw anyone assaulting him. Yesterday I was trying to take a peak and look at him through the railings to see if he's okay but the owner came out and started staring at me. I don't know if they are abusive or not but this doesn't feel right. I even thought about breaking in and letting him out but where would I take him? It also did not feel sane.This is Bangalore and I'm from north and new here and I don't know the local language and honestly I'm too afraid to talk to the owner personally. Can anyone help? What should I do? I tried posting this in Bangalore sub but couldn't get insights maybe due to the video attachment.",

        "Honestly, a very common sight in most part of India. Here, people buy dogs and just keep em in the cage for eternity. They buy them only as guard dogs even though they wouldn't even hurt a fly. Its a sad truth. Majority of the owners are not willing to take care of a dog the right way(mostly because it's expensive). My relatives had two dogs. Both em stayed in a cage majority of the time and only take em out to pee/poo. You can educate the owners but to no use because I don't think an Indian is willing to spend thousands of rupees just to take care of their pet.",

As far as I remember, exact times were not mentioned and there was some scope for subjectivity there. But keeping an animal caged or chained all day and night without giving it breaks for play, food, exercise is definitely illegal. Animal NGOs will be able to guide you further. \n\nThe other hurdle in the way of rescuing this guy will be the owner's ego. He likely regrets getting the dog on a whim, as if it was just a soft toy, and now cannot handle its mental physical and emotional needs. Unless you can collect evidence and fight him in the courts, the easier and more commonly successful way would be to offer him money in return of the pupper. He will probably be happy to part with the puppy if he thinks you are an eager buyer instead of a preachy animal welfare activist.\n\nThanks for caring, best of luck, and keep us updated!",
