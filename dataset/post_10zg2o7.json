    "selftext": "So, my dad got pickpocketed and someone took his iPhone at the vegetable(sabzi) market. He only realized when he came out of the whole place but it was already too late, tried going back to the vendors but no success.\nWe tried calling, phone‚Äôs switched off. Apple has phone tracking and we tried all that and  managed to get the location of the phone (pic attached) in Asansol (W.Bengal), the place had bunch of mobile store in close proximity and funnily a police station nearby. \nDad went to police station, did all the paperwork even gave the screenshot of the location, (un)surprisingly nothing happened. \nA few days go by and I get I text (pic attached) that the phone is switched on and click to track it, because I had mentioned my number to contact me, it asks you to login into his Apple account, the UI is identical, and voila nothing happens and I try again, and a minute or two later the Apple account gets unlinked from the phone, there goes the last hope.\nSo that was it and nothing was ever heard, either from the competent thieves or the incompetent police.\n\nSo-\nDon‚Äôt lose the phone.\nIf you do, know the type of links to NOT click.",
