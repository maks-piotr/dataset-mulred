        "The school I went to for a couple of years literally had old asbestos roofs(that wavy tin style). Sometimes they'd break and were replaced with more asbestos roof sheets. \n\nDidn't think about them for years till I started looking to buying a house here in the US(bought January) and realized how big of a deal having asbestos in your dwelling is, especially old asbestos. \n\nTold my wife about it(school roof) and she got concerned enough to ask if we should go to the doctor. I told her, coming from India, Asbestos should be the least of our worry about what could be inside my body.",
        "I lost my father to one of these manufacturing plants in Faridabad (NCR). in his youth he used to work in this cement shed manufacturing plant, where they openly used asbestos, and without any safety equipment. I am talking about the 80s and 90s. \n\nHe never smoked a cig, nor touched alcohol. He was fit even at 60. But when he was 61, he was diagonsed with Mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer. It was 4th stage. I Travelled from one specialist to anotherbut none could help. \n\nMy mother and me havent gotten over this untimely loss. HOPE THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO ANYONE",
