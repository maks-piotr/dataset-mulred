    "selftext": "Aukaat of Flipkart vs Amazon India \nFlipkart aka Fraudkart - \nWanted to share my experience (with pics) with flipkart & many others who r experiencing it every day . \nHow Flipkart hires a lawyer to defend themselves of Frauds they do & even point finger at you (customer) that you r trying to harass Flipkart with mal intention . This is how they value their customers . \n\nThis is what happens when fraud happens on Flipkart in contrast to Amazon .\n\nI got a slip instead of ₹2899 CD & return policy was not an option on dis product . So when i tried to contact Flipkart Customer support .. only an AI machine was there to attend me & that machine repeatedly kept on saying that this product is received & you cannot return it . As it was just a machine .. i cudnt even explain my situation . Then i tried to give a review on this product warning other buyers about this seller which did not get published . Then what i noticed is that on this popular product .. very few reviews were present & all were positive. So even reviews on Flipkart are fake & if someone tries to give real feedback .. it gets ignored to SAFEGUARD fraud that's happening on their website . \n\nCOURT CASE-\n\nafter few months  i filed a case against Flipkart .. i got call from someone working in Flipkart saying that we need some proof & all other stuff in order to come to conclusion that me as customer is not lying . I said that i already posted review with pics but ur website didn't published it ... in reply he says that review may not be according to our policy .. \nI asked them if only positive reviews come under their policy ..? he didn't know how to reply to that . \nSo in court instead of refunding me ₹2899.. they hired a lawyer who prepared papers which says that me as a customer is trying to harass Flipkart by false charging . It was also written that whatever happens on Flipkart website is not a responsibility of Flipkart at all . \nSo are we as customers r fool to trust Flipkart as brand wen they don't even care what's goin on their website .\nI cud hv continued this case but hassle of going to court & fighting this giant Fraudsters was not something i thought is worth for . See this is not about getting 2800₹ back .. it's about fighting against such fraud companies who treat their customers like trash.\n\nAMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE- \n\nAt last i wud like to tell How Amazon have dedicated teams to help u through ..in such situations . As one of their product didn't get deliver to me but it was marked as delivered on website .. i contacted them .. explained de situation .. they said give us 3 days .. our team will investigate on this matter if it was a mistake from seller or courier .. after 3 days they refunded me full amount . Usually i don't experience such things on Amazon . i hv bought multiple items from Amazon till now but i bought 4 items from #Flipkart & 2 out of them were frauds & they also harass u for using their website .",

        "Fuck around and find out. \n\nNo one uses Flipkart anymore. They have moved on to instant loan scams as well. They are basically mafia now.",
        "I avoid Flipkart even when it's an official retail partner.",
        "the audacity to claim a big company is being harrassed by a cheated customer, this fucking reeks... hope you get your refund, must be so painful to go through this shit procedure",
        "I can vouch that amazon customer care is really good",
        "Is it just me or Indians customers are just dumb? \n\nIf you’ve opened it in front of the delivery guy, you should reject the delivery. \nSince you have shared the OTP with him, you can no longer return it.",
        "These are just outliers. They are good 99% of the time. \n\nAlso, the OP here says he opened the box during delivery and yet he accepted the delivery and gave the OTP. \n\nIn this case there are only two scenarios:\n\n1. OP is dumb\n2. OP is trying to defraud flipkart by faking it.",
        "OP the review takes a good amount of time to show on their site.",
        "Flipkart currently has much higher share than Amazon than it had 4-5 years ago.",
        "ok before calling anyone \"dumb\" and coming to a conclusion ... one shud know exactly what happened ... see i didn't open package in front of de guy .. wen he insisted to check de package .. someone else took that package for me in de house & wen i checked .. everything was done & i didn't care to make him wait till i open my package cus i knew i can always return it or ask for an replacement ... even after u share OTP .. products hv return policy which videos games used to hv but in order to thrive mal practises & fraudsters on their website .. Fraudkart removed that feature .. so another thing i cud do was contact Fraudkart ppl but only a machine answered on phone which kept in replying same thing that product is received & return policy is not there .. so it means if a seller sends u a soap instead of an iphone .. & return policy is not dere .. customer is to be blamed .. in dis way u can sell anything on fraudkart by telling its laptop or a phone",
        "I never order from Flipkart. They are fraudsters. And I would prefer to do a rollback or credit card charges.",
        "months have passed since i posted my review ... nothing is there .. secondly how can such a popular product just hv 4 to 5 reviews & all positive ..? dats doesn't make any sense .. even after their representative called me wen i filed my case .. he said ur review was not according to our policy .. & i asked him that only positive reviews r in policy .. dat MF stayed mum",
        "Yes Flipkart is terrible. I was a regular Amazon user with Amazon credit card n all but then decided to try Flipkart since it's our Desi company. Received duplicate products and noticed that I can't directly talk to customer care people! Since it was a small value product I just decided to throw it away and never use Flipkart again. \nAmazon on the other hand never gave me a bad experience. Whenever I get bad quality product I ask for a callback and their people talk to me and give a refund directly.\nOnce I ordered a refrigerator via Amazon and it wasn't returnable. After delivery i realised that it wasn't big enough for my family. I called Amazon customer care and honestly told them \"Hey, I know this isn't returnable but the size is really small for me. Can you do something?\" They probably checked my history and profile but they did return the appliance and I was able to purchase another one! Just love Amazon!",
        "You have just now edited the post man. \n\nWhen I first read, it said you did an open box delivery.",
        "It is a Steam Code, and not the product ordered. And, that mail isn't a  flipkart mail or probably retailnet either 'flipkartservicespvt@gmail.com' . It is like trying to make it look original. As well as flipkart logo. Flipkart can't longer sell with it logo (as a seller) I think due to Govt rules.",

        "Yes every time you raise issue all you get is reply from chatbot and talking to customer care team is next to impossible 😂😂",
        "I've avoided Flipkart since years lol\n\nAlso, a suggestion:\nGo for digital games on the PS5. They have constant discounts and chances are, you won't get scammed like this. Unless you wanna sell those discs later, go for actual discs and if not, go for digital",

        "I have had trust issues on flipkart hence never order stuffs from filpkart..",
        "yea exactly ... Fraudkart doesn't give a damn !",
        "On amazon i had similar experience, i bought a product in the offer which was damaged and there was no replacement policy on that so they said that we will do a return and u can place the same order again, by the time i had placed new order offer was expired so customer service executive said amazon will give u difference amount refund.\n\nBut after that customer service refused to reimburse difference amount so i simply wrote long email to their grievances cell and they refunded me within 24hr",

        "Mera experience bhi Amazon ke sath achha Raha hai aur Flipkart to Bhai fraud hi hai sab!!",

        "That's why I have stopped buying anything expensive on e commerce. One of my friends bought a phone worth 40k on Amazon and got a brick delivered to him. After a month of to and fro with Amazon he got his refund but it is just not worth it for me. \n\nAlso one purchase of 800 from an e commerce company which I never received. No refunds either. \n\nI just go to the shop nearby get great customer service and it's done. No e commerce for me except for swiggy, I trust that company lol. Also because swiggy orders are usually Rs 500-1000 only.",

        "Price and products. Flipkart has a bunch of products that Amazon simply doesn't have in India. Amazon has a serious variety problem. So, people prefer to get products and deal with poor customer service than not get products at all.",
        "Just the very same happened with me but against Swiggy. Ordered food, prepaid obviously & straight out of the Restaurant he marked it delivered. no OTP at all. wasn't receiving any calls either. had a conversation with customer care & they lied saying he has delivered & even talked, I asked for recorded audio as I knew he didn't pick. then she herself (customer executive) admitted that delivery bot didn't pick the calls. emailed with video proofs but email team said as it's marked delivered, we can't do anything. so that's all these companies are all about. No Credibility at all. I don't order online anything apart from company websites.",
        "The [last time I ordered from flipkart](https://np.reddit.com/r/watchesindia/comments/172wy3d/soooo_this_happened_stay_vigilant_friends/), someone in the delivery chain stole the item and replaced it with a cheap one. I caught that during open box delivery but the guy tried to convince me to accept it and give him the OTP, which I didn't do. Have been very careful about ordering from there since then.",
        "Is it just me, or does anyone else find their website to be shitty? I was never convinced to use their website or the app when I see their UI.",

        "Now it feels like maybe Flipkart is correct here, op is just insanely dumb",
        "While i believe your story and agree that there are a lot of scams on Flipkart, few things do not line up.\n1. There is an open box delivery process for items valued at more than 1k.\n2. I orderd during recent sale, and they lost my order.. customer care was always reachable.\n\nPlease keep updating about developments in your case.",

        "Buddy I hope you get justice, just don't want you to stress to the point where it will affect your helath. I'm very happy to see you fight, and based on what you shared many of us(the consumers) will be aware and start to not shop on Flipkart. There was a time when I used to hear it, but the day started hearing from friends and family, I discontinued shopping on the platform. And this was back in 2017, now 6 years later nothing has changed. Do note the platform favors the sellers even if they are cons, and the customer support is filled with duds, call them 20 times, each of the time you will have to explain the grievance.",
        "Market share and share market are different bro 💀",
        "This is how court cases are. This is how memo are in courts. It is a basic format. Plus yes flipkart os just a platform. \nYou should have sued the seller. \nLet the cases atleast go in its natural course memos submitted in courts are just basic formats with particular details of the case. \nOr next time get a better advocate.",
        "There are so many people in India. Unless these posts go viral, they can keep cheating customers for a long time without going out of business.",
        "Flipkart's share isn't available on market. I am talking about market share. Flipkart is growing and near 70% of the market share on most of the ecommerce categories. It was more worried about Meesho than about Amazon for the last 3-4 years. You see more people posting on social media about Flipkart's bad customer care policies, but that isn't really affecting the business.\n\nThe only custom message to report scam for no return orders I guess is @flipkartsupport on twitter.",

Asked me to google OnePlus service centre and contact them. couldn't even provide that details. The url they provided for OnePlus support in the order page was not working and when i asked abt it they ghosted me. \n\nso yea amazon aint that better either. it depends on your luck i guess.",

        "somehow i'm unable to see where i mentioned that i was there in a open box delivery ... neither i can see \"neighbour\" written anywhere .. it was my maid who picked de stuff for me .. she was conversing with me while i was in my room that it doesn't seem like a CD .. but courier guy kept on forcing to open & check  .. there may b a game code .. so she brought that package in .. & wen i checked it .. he was gone at dat time .. i called him & talked really aggressively with him to make talk with who's in authority for delivering products in my city or area .. then he stopped picking me calls ..  i see there r some real toxic ppl around us like u that without knowing properly try to judge someone's situation or intentions .. it really stuns me sometimes .. & believing in company like flipkart which has been given names like Fraudkart from years ..  amazing personalities .. really ! 😅",
        "Delivery was made with OTP verification(as per your first screenshot), So it was open box delivery. You won't be able to claim refund even if you receive budget phone instead of macbook, as you have shared OTP, Which you were supposed to share after checking your order",

        "yea thats true. I guess my experience with Flipkart was slightly better. Maybe I am some of the lucky few left who had a good experience with Flipkart support. Anyways i've learned to take a good look at their return/replacement policy before buying anything now.",

How Flipkart hires a lawyer to defend themselves of Frauds they do & even point finger at you (customer) that you r trying to harass Flipkart with mal intention . This is how they value their customers . This is what happens when fraud happens on Flipkart in contrast to Amazon . I got a slip instead of ₹2899 CD & return policy was not an option on dis product . So when i tried to contact Flipkart Customer support .. only an AI machine was there to attend me & that machine repeatedly kept on saying that this product is received & you cannot return it . As it was just a machine .. i cudnt even explain my situation . Then i tried to give a review on this product warning other buyers about this seller which did not get published . Then what i noticed is that on this popular product .. very few reviews were present & all were positive. So even reviews on Flipkart are fake & if someone tries to give real feedback .. it gets ignored to SAFEGUARD fraud that's happening on their website . COURT CASE- after few months i filed a case against Flipkart .. i got call from someone working in Flipkart saying that we need some proof & all other stuff in order to come to conclusion that me as customer is not lying . I said that i already posted review with pics but ur website didn't published it ... in reply he says that review may not be according to our policy .. I asked them if only positive reviews come under their policy ..? he didn't know how to reply to that . So in court instead of refunding me ₹2899.. they hired a lawyer who prepared papers which says that me as a customer is trying to harass Flipkart by false charging . It was also written that whatever happens on Flipkart website is not a responsibility of Flipkart at all . So are we as customers r fool to trust Flipkart as brand wen they don't even care what's goin on their website . I cud hv continued this case but hassle of going to court & fighting this giant Fraudsters was not something i thought is worth for . See this is not about getting 2800₹ back .. it's about fighting against such fraud companies who treat their customers like trash. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE- At last i wud like to tell How Amazon have dedicated teams to help u through ..in such situations . As one of their product didn't get deliver to me but it was marked as delivered on website .. i contacted them .. explained de situation .. they said give us 3 days .. our team will investigate on this matter if it was a mistake from seller or courier .. after 3 days they refunded me full amount . Usually i don't experience such things on Amazon . i hv bought multiple items from Amazon till now but i bought 4 items from #Flipkart & 2 out of them were frauds & they also harass u for using their website .",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "How is Flipkart still in business? I don't remember the last time I opened this app and didn't see some malpractice post Fuck around and find out. No one uses Flipkart anymore. They have moved on to instant loan scams as well. They are basically mafia now. I avoid Flipkart even when it's an official retail partner. the audacity to claim a big company is being harrassed by a cheated customer, this fucking reeks... hope you get your refund, must be so painful to go through this shit procedure I can vouch that amazon customer care is really good Is it just me or Indians customers are just dumb? If you’ve opened it in front of the delivery guy, you should reject the delivery. Since you have shared the OTP with him, you can no longer return it. These are just outliers. They are good 99% of the time. Also, the OP here says he opened the box during delivery and yet he accepted the delivery and gave the OTP. In this case there are only two scenarios: 1. OP is dumb 2. OP is trying to defraud flipkart by faking it. OP the review takes a good amount of time to show on their site. Flipkart currently has much higher share than Amazon than it had 4-5 years ago. ok before calling anyone \"dumb\" and coming to a conclusion ... one shud know exactly what happened ... see i didn't open package in front of de guy .. wen he insisted to check de package .. someone else took that package for me in de house & wen i checked .. everything was done & i didn't care to make him wait till i open my package cus i knew i can always return it or ask for an replacement ... even after u share OTP .. products hv return policy which videos games used to hv but in order to thrive mal practises & fraudsters on their website .. Fraudkart removed that feature .. so another thing i cud do was contact Fraudkart ppl but only a machine answered on phone which kept in replying same thing that product is received & return policy is not there .. so it means if a seller sends u a soap instead of an iphone .. & return policy is not dere .. customer is to be blamed .. in dis way u can sell anything on fraudkart by telling its laptop or a phone I never order from Flipkart. They are fraudsters. And I would prefer to do a rollback or credit card charges. months have passed since i posted my review ... nothing is there .. secondly how can such a popular product just hv 4 to 5 reviews & all positive ..? dats doesn't make any sense .. even after their representative called me wen i filed my case .. he said ur review was not according to our policy .. & i asked him that only positive reviews r in policy .. dat MF stayed mum Yes Flipkart is terrible. I was a regular Amazon user with Amazon credit card n all but then decided to try Flipkart since it's our Desi company. Received duplicate products and noticed that I can't directly talk to customer care people! Since it was a small value product I just decided to throw it away and never use Flipkart again. Amazon on the other hand never gave me a bad experience. Whenever I get bad quality product I ask for a callback and their people talk to me and give a refund directly. Once I ordered a refrigerator via Amazon and it wasn't returnable. After delivery i realised that it wasn't big enough for my family. I called Amazon customer care and honestly told them \"Hey, I know this isn't returnable but the size is really small for me. Can you do something?\" They probably checked my history and profile but they did return the appliance and I was able to purchase another one! Just love Amazon! You have just now edited the post man. When I first read, it said you did an open box delivery. It is a Steam Code, and not the product ordered. And, that mail isn't a flipkart mail or probably retailnet either 'flipkartservicespvt@gmail.com' . It is like trying to make it look original. As well as flipkart logo. Flipkart can't longer sell with it logo (as a seller) I think due to Govt rules. \"he opened the box during delivery and yet he accepted the delivery\" u talking like dumb & calling others dumb .. hv u even read properly .. +1 dude from how many days u on reddit ?? u know we cannot edit our post once it's posted ?? see who is acting \"dumb\" now Yes every time you raise issue all you get is reply from chatbot and talking to customer care team is next to impossible 😂😂 I've avoided Flipkart since years lol Also, a suggestion: Go for digital games on the PS5. They have constant discounts and chances are, you won't get scammed like this. Unless you wanna sell those discs later, go for actual discs and if not, go for digital All that aside but why the fuck are you talking like a black guy \"de package, dis way\" annoying ass punk I have had trust issues on flipkart hence never order stuffs from filpkart.. yea exactly ... Fraudkart doesn't give a damn ! On amazon i had similar experience, i bought a product in the offer which was damaged and there was no replacement policy on that so they said that we will do a return and u can place the same order again, by the time i had placed new order offer was expired so customer service executive said amazon will give u difference amount refund. But after that customer service refused to reimburse difference amount so i simply wrote long email to their grievances cell and they refunded me within 24hr 🤣🤣 Steam and PS5 Mera experience bhi Amazon ke sath achha Raha hai aur Flipkart to Bhai fraud hi hai sab!! except you can lol That's why I have stopped buying anything expensive on e commerce. One of my friends bought a phone worth 40k on Amazon and got a brick delivered to him. After a month of to and fro with Amazon he got his refund but it is just not worth it for me. Also one purchase of 800 from an e commerce company which I never received. No refunds either. I just go to the shop nearby get great customer service and it's done. No e commerce for me except for swiggy, I trust that company lol. Also because swiggy orders are usually Rs 500-1000 only. Request to kindly keep us posted on the development of the case. They being good is the outlier lmao If your product is not what you have ordered then you can refuse to accept the order. \"refuse to accept \".. dude i checked that's fake fookin slip after that guy went away .. i don't know y even at this state .. a customer is being called upon by some .. for trusting flipkart .. such a \"popular\" website .. that wat ever may go wrong .. flipkart is there to get me out of da problem as wat Amazon does Price and products. Flipkart has a bunch of products that Amazon simply doesn't have in India. Amazon has a serious variety problem. So, people prefer to get products and deal with poor customer service than not get products at all. Just the very same happened with me but against Swiggy. Ordered food, prepaid obviously & straight out of the Restaurant he marked it delivered. no OTP at all. wasn't receiving any calls either. had a conversation with customer care & they lied saying he has delivered & even talked, I asked for recorded audio as I knew he didn't pick. then she herself (customer executive) admitted that delivery bot didn't pick the calls. emailed with video proofs but email team said as it's marked delivered, we can't do anything. so that's all these companies are all about. No Credibility at all. I don't order online anything apart from company websites. The [last time I ordered from flipkart](https://np.reddit.com/r/watchesindia/comments/172wy3d/soooo_this_happened_stay_vigilant_friends/), someone in the delivery chain stole the item and replaced it with a cheap one. I caught that during open box delivery but the guy tried to convince me to accept it and give him the OTP, which I didn't do. Have been very careful about ordering from there since then. Is it just me, or does anyone else find their website to be shitty? I was never convinced to use their website or the app when I see their UI. You do know that share price does not accurately represent a company's current or future success? I don't know much about share market but you should also check how many shares are held by ceo and other executives, and how many they sold Lmaooooooo Now it feels like maybe Flipkart is correct here, op is just insanely dumb While i believe your story and agree that there are a lot of scams on Flipkart, few things do not line up. 1. There is an open box delivery process for items valued at more than 1k. 2. I orderd during recent sale, and they lost my order.. customer care was always reachable. Please keep updating about developments in your case. > Is it just me or Indians customers are just dumb? Bhaiyya thedaga ledu ee sentence 😂 Arrey flipkart, post from your real account Honestly, this is a rare case. I've had wrong deliveries or damaged products on delivery, but I always record me accepting the order and recording it, in case it is not open box delivery. I've never faced any issue getting refunds Buddy I hope you get justice, just don't want you to stress to the point where it will affect your helath. I'm very happy to see you fight, and based on what you shared many of us(the consumers) will be aware and start to not shop on Flipkart. There was a time when I used to hear it, but the day started hearing from friends and family, I discontinued shopping on the platform. And this was back in 2017, now 6 years later nothing has changed. Do note the platform favors the sellers even if they are cons, and the customer support is filled with duds, call them 20 times, each of the time you will have to explain the grievance. Market share and share market are different bro 💀 This is how court cases are. This is how memo are in courts. It is a basic format. Plus yes flipkart os just a platform. You should have sued the seller. Let the cases atleast go in its natural course memos submitted in courts are just basic formats with particular details of the case. Or next time get a better advocate. There are so many people in India. Unless these posts go viral, they can keep cheating customers for a long time without going out of business. Flipkart's share isn't available on market. I am talking about market share. Flipkart is growing and near 70% of the market share on most of the ecommerce categories. It was more worried about Meesho than about Amazon for the last 3-4 years. You see more people posting on social media about Flipkart's bad customer care policies, but that isn't really affecting the business. The only custom message to report scam for no return orders I guess is @flipkartsupport on twitter. For me amazon was worse than flipkart ur story ? After reading the comments I know op is the one frauing flipkart, blud first says he was there in a open box delivery, then says his neighbor picked it up , next he will say Jeff Bezos delivered his parcel Personally my experience with flipkart is better than Amazon, and fortunately maybe I have never defrauded by flipkart Oh my bad Aapki toh literally battery exhaust ho gayi ye court case ladte ladte i got a OnePlus nord ce 3 for my mom from amazon and within 2 days i got a green line. Contacted their customer care for return or replacement and they told they cant do anything. Asked me to google OnePlus service centre and contact them. couldn't even provide that details. The url they provided for OnePlus support in the order page was not working and when i asked abt it they ghosted me. so yea amazon aint that better either. it depends on your luck i guess. Flipkart has sellers that openly sell pirated games for PC, for years now. Flipkart is registered in Singapore Meesho is the worst Its a very long story that can even be made into a short film. AMAZON IS MUCH BETTER I ordered RAM worth 5k. It was a non-returnable item, and it was the first order from my non kyc account. There was an issue with the rgb leds of the ram. Called cc and received a full refund, and they said you can keep the product somehow i'm unable to see where i mentioned that i was there in a open box delivery ... neither i can see \"neighbour\" written anywhere .. it was my maid who picked de stuff for me .. she was conversing with me while i was in my room that it doesn't seem like a CD .. but courier guy kept on forcing to open & check .. there may b a game code .. so she brought that package in .. & wen i checked it .. he was gone at dat time .. i called him & talked really aggressively with him to make talk with who's in authority for delivering products in my city or area .. then he stopped picking me calls .. i see there r some real toxic ppl around us like u that without knowing properly try to judge someone's situation or intentions .. it really stuns me sometimes .. & believing in company like flipkart which has been given names like Fraudkart from years .. amazing personalities .. really ! 😅 Delivery was made with OTP verification(as per your first screenshot), So it was open box delivery. You won't be able to claim refund even if you receive budget phone instead of macbook, as you have shared OTP, Which you were supposed to share after checking your order Atleast you were able to connect to Amazon team here in case of flipkart only chatbot will reply wasting ur time without any proper information may be it was supposed to be an open box delivery but it wasn't .. as it was my maid who brought it from de courier guy after telling me that dis doesn't look like physical CD but courier kept on forcing that open it up .. there will be a code for the game .. so wen she brought that in and i checked .. it was a fluke slip .. & he was gone at that time .. & i don't understand how can his laptop or any gadget in seconds wether it's fine or not without checking thoroughly .. many a times .. problem comes after few days .. & it gets replaced .. but in this case all doors were closed .. & Fradukart allowed scammers to sell anything in de name of anything freely without letting their customers to even put review on their products to actually tell wat happened with em .. so that can't scam others .. 🙏 yea thats true. I guess my experience with Flipkart was slightly better. Maybe I am some of the lucky few left who had a good experience with Flipkart support. Anyways i've learned to take a good look at their return/replacement policy before buying anything now. LoL .. daayum! Don't lie mate I have read the post before handed, and why tf did you remove it? Wasn't editing enough? Sure if you were defrauded then please launch a complaint in consumer court but I don't think you were actually frauded mate this post is about consumer court case only .. now pls don't say i edited it ..& put it there .. as i'm sure that u cannot edit ur post on ios for some reason .. as i'm not seeing any option for it after selecting those 3 dots above the post .. & u can thing watever u want to think mate .. who is forcing u .. u seem like a very intelligent human .. hv fun my mate .. think anything .. sky is de limit 👍 I don't know but I can edit my posts, not sure why you're unable to but I already read your post then you edited it, but does it even matter about what I think go ahead and sue them I already see loads of complaints about flipkart Also next time buying anything from Flipkart Or Amazon check out the list of their official sellers that might help wat i had written in my unedited version .. can u pls tell me ? so that i can know as well How is it possible now? Why did you removed your post? can ppl still see me post or it's totally vanished ? The optional text under a post is always editable, irrespective of the platform Flipkart was wrong but as a consumer you also have a responsibility, just because I am pointing out your mistake doesn’t mean I am defending flipkart. At the very least to get to learn from your mistake and you seem to be throwing away that opportunity too. see wat i learnt from all this is that Fraudkart was da right name given to them & i want to spread awareness among watever ppl i come across .. as this was my first ever online shopping goof up in dese many years ... i'm already better protecting myself than most ppl out dere who buy things from instagram ads You have edited the post. When I first read it, you said you made an open box delivery in front of the delivery person. ok bro .. i know u wudnt believe but really there is no option showing for me here .. wen i select those 3 dots .. there is delete option , add flair , copy text etc. but no edit ... i youtube it .. & in comments ppl r saying that even they can't see any edit option .. maybe it's operating system difference or something else .. idk That's just to save some taxes. But it is an Indian crappy company."
