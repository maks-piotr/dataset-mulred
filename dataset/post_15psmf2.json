    "selftext": "I just noticed this trend recently. New or shady sellers are listing their fake/inferior products on existing highly rated product listings as a variant. So, when someone will search for the product, he will see it as 5 stars rated with thousands of awesome ratings but in fact that particular product has been listed as a variant of a non-related product and has no rating and/or have bad review.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor example, I was searching for memory form pillows. Caught my eyes on [first two listings](https://i.imgur.com/gqaNjfh.png). First one has 4.3 star with 4661 reviews and second one has 4.6 star with 20,518 reviews. Looks like an amazing product. Right? Wrong.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1st product ([Swiffer Memory Foam Pillow](https://www.amazon.in/Swiffer-Orthopedic-Cervical-Cleaning-Standard/dp/B0CBKR7HYQ/)) is listed as a variant of a mopping cloth (check other variants/styles) and when I checked the reviews only for pillow, many people are complaining about bad quality and fake product. The best part is, Swiffer doesnâ€™t even make memory pillows.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2nd [pillow is from Holikme](https://www.amazon.in/Holikme-Cervical-Contour-Sleeping-Orthopedic/dp/B0CDM6BLR6/) which is listed as a variant of storage organizer tool. Out of 20.5k ratings, there is 0 rating for pillow. Seller ([LOOK BOX](https://www.amazon.in/sp?marketplaceID=A21TJRUUN4KGV&seller=A2EQAAJP2GJ1ZJ)) is new with no reviews. I could not find more details about the brand but I am pretty sure this brand also doesnâ€™t make memory pillows.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is one listing from [Black & Decker](https://www.amazon.in/Black-Decker-Orthopedic-Cervical-Cleaning/dp/B0CCNQLRF4/) too which doesnâ€™t make any kind of memory form pillows. But this particular seller ([SHIV.ENTERPRISE](https://www.amazon.in/sp?marketplaceID=A21TJRUUN4KGV&seller=A3QZQV3A47M2AB), shady seller) has listed it as a variant of Black & Decker hedge trimmer which has 4.7 star with 6.5k ratings. How many ratings does this pillow have? Only 2 and one of the reviewers claiming fake product.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am sure some of you may know about it already but many people donâ€™t. Thatâ€™s why I thought I should share this here. It may save a few people from ordering shitty products thinking they are buying from reputed brand. Olx, Quikr etc used to be the home for scammers but these days, Amazon/Flipkart is down the same path. Support is not always helpful in many of these cases, although they so help in some but majority of such cases are not even reported.",

        "Good video. This guy is also talking about the same issue I noticed in last week.\n\nI knew sellers buy reviews from my BHW days so I don't really trust well formatted reviews. I usually read what 2-3 star rated reviewers are saying or what people are saying about a product on reddit.",
        "Yes I also came across this. Bought cat litter and seller used reputed company as main seller from Canada and reviews are 4.5 Star and when the product came itâ€™s from UP no connection between 2 companies. I have reviewed in Amazon but they didnâ€™t show my reviews strange otherwise my other reviews come up.",
        "So the scammer was definitely bengali right?",
        "> I have reviewed in Amazon but they didnâ€™t show my reviews strange otherwise my other reviews come up.\n\nHappened with me too. A few times, Amazon removed and disqualified my genuine reviews, yet these review sellers get their reviews approved without any issue and that too in bulk.",
        "sellers can claim reviews as inappropriate to remove them and amazon doesn't check. You can click on the seller and see some of the reviews have strikethrough text",
        "Everything is made in China. It's just rebranded generic products. Even you can purchase something similar in bulk from China, set up your own brand and sell it. There is no \"original\" brand.",
        "how to see reviews just as pillow?",
        "With names like Holikme and Swiffer,I will be super cautious. Whenever a listing has multiple variants,I check review of that particular product only. Genuine reviews generally do not sugar coat words. Also most fake reviews are made almost at same time period with generic names like Stuart,Bob or KevinðŸ˜‰",
        "On any product page, go to reviews and click to see all reviews. On reviews page, there will be [dropdown selects boxes](https://i.imgur.com/ZjNEHT0.png) to filter reviews.

        "Amazon sucks and is full of scammers since they are more focused on making life hell for legitimate sellers that give them good business",
        "I have seen thousands of positive reviews under product A, but they were actually reviews of product B.  \n\n\nProduct A was NOT even remotely related to product B!  \n\n\nMaybe product B was good, but Product A was certainly rubbish.  \n\n\nI don't know how the scammers did it.",
        "Not me watching this post days after buying a foam pillow ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ \nNew pillow works good though",
        "I think once they list themselves as a seller of the B product then I think they can also add a variant (product A) of product B and add images and all. Amazon doesn't really check in such cases I think otherwise it should not have happened in the first place.\n\nOnce they add product A as a variant of product B, product A will get the ratings of product B also. This is my understanding.",
        "> With names like Holikme and Swiffer,I will be super cautious.\n\nThese are genuine western brands creating some of the best products in their field.",
        "Hahaha. That's true. It's not simple as it used to be. Search the product and check the rating/review. Now, full on investigation is required.",

Would it be cheaper for them to ignore the issue and invite a group of volunteers who they can send hot products for free for their authentic reviews or to employ a manual review process by employing 100k new staff. Choice is clear.",
        "That's astonishing!  \n\n\nI had searched for a pillow and found one with a rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars.
