The trick is to ensure they are not harvested too early (which is a problem with most Dasheris” you get in the market. But if you know a farmer who knows what they’re doing (most likely in UP), you end up with the greatest experience in fruit.\n\nI will also say that I’ve almost always been disappointed with Alphonso. They’re good, no question, but for their reputation I wouldn’t even put them in the top 3-5 on this image. They do tend to be more *consistent* than other varietals, probably thanks to better management and quality control brought about by the price and commercial interest.",

IMHO, nothing compares with a properly ripened Dasheri. The trick is to ensure they are not harvested too early (which is a problem with most Dasheris” you get in the market. But if you know a farmer who knows what they’re doing (most likely in UP), you end up with the greatest experience in fruit. I will also say that I’ve almost always been disappointed with Alphonso. They’re good, no question, but for their reputation I wouldn’t even put them in the top 3-5 on this image. They do tend to be more *consistent* than other varietals, probably thanks to better management and quality control brought about by the price and commercial interest. This is the mango in my native place. The best mango i have ever ate. Is it just me who doesn't like mangoes? 🥹 ig so it's just me Amrapali Your favourite mango OP, is called ಆನೆತರ್ಡ್ ಮಾವಿನಕಾಯಿ locally here. The literal translation is funny. I rather not like to translate.😂 Langda is the best & if not available then Himsagar. Bro Alphonso supremacy forever!! Banganapalle is very watery and toned down. Way below Alphonse. If only Alphonso was a bit cheaper 😭 That's what everyone wishes for, everyone that cannot afford it that is! Indeed. Although, I haven't tried Himsagar yet! Google translate says 'one third mango'?! Say it isn't so! Never thought reality developers were into mangoes! /S Blasphemy! /S That one Katrina Kaif ad. Also kesari is sweet and flavour full Are you sure it's mango, and not an apricot? /S Yo tastes like sandpaper. Its better eaten semi ripe with chillies etc. I concur! But Dussehri has lost it's appeal to me, mostly because of the enormous amounts I've gobbled up!🤭 Langda ftw. Near my hometown we have a milky variety of langda (it has a whitish hue on the green skin). That's the best variety of mango that I have eaten in my life. Happy Cake Day! Virtual Party Ahoy!🎂🎊🎉 Yes yes only you Well i prefer kapuri , it is produced in large amounts in my locality. Also biju is also the one The one that comes from tree Pics, or didn't happen! /S Thanks! Shame that you didn't include Maldah, that's what the best mango is. I think I remember that one, or was it some other food given the same name?!🤦🏻‍♂️ Langda/Malda > Beganpalle > Alphonso > all others Honorary mention to Gulabkhas, which is my go to mango for Amras.... Outrageous! /S Alphonse ( hapus) langda himsagar and kesar Duly noted! /S Dassehri. None better than that. Yeah cause langda is available pretty much everywhere and himsagar is not usually transported out of West Bengal Raavan would beg to differ! /S Alrighty then, time for a visit to the East! /S Imam Pasand Not a religious post! /S Alphonso is like the only meaningful mango that qualifies for the 'king of fruits' tag. Alphonso ultimate supremacy>> Kesar Happy cake day! Only if you can afford it! /S Badam! /S LNgda tyagi Bahubali! /S Malda Himsagar ftw. And I have tried loads of mango but nothing beats this. So fucking sweet! Alphanso, kesar, dushari So sweet it hurtsss! /S Not to be confused with Alphonso and Dussehri! /S None of the mangoes shown in the 3rd slide are Maldah Indeed. I was confusing Malda with Malta, an orange variety!🤦🏻‍♂️ Langda ftw Dussehri is also good. Alphonso overrated Introverts Ahoy! /S No need to add /s Muscle memory! /S \"Amateurs\" said the best one. \"Say what punk?\" Screamed the Langdas, Dasehris, Maldas, Alphonso and others 'AMATEURS!\" Said the King of Mangoes. The Mighty CHAUSA. Bangnanapalli and sindhura (also the cheapest variants) That's mostly propaganda. It's the iPhone of mangoes. It's good but nowhere near worth the pricetag. Arent Malda and Langda basically the same mango variety but grown in different regions? Underrated mango. Sweetest MF I've ever tasted. MF = mango family member Hapus True, my bad. It's so widely known as Malda here that I had no idea about Langda Why is Payri not here? Kesar is best... it's the sweetest then comes Himsagar(Desi) next Safeda! Big and juicy! W taste Chausa > Langda (banarasi) > Dasehri Looks like sindura Kesar. I'm a maharashtrian but I'm sorry. I just like the flavour of kesar better than hapus You all are wrong. Ripe Kesar is king. You sir, are correct. I’m so sad Kesar has so few supporters. Maldah is the goat, period! Alphonso Safeda milta har jagh hai but kabhi mainstream media me nhi aya bechara..its the vijay verma of mangoes Langda Reading all comments, it’s clear none of you guys have tried Malgova. It’s defacto GOAT of all mangoes. Banganapalle is an honorary mention. Aam koi b ho, khud tod ke khane me hi asli maza hai. Sinduri, safeda, totapari i like sweet and sour mangoes, too much sweet mangoes feels like having a spoonful of flavoured sugar None, i don't really like mangoes, i find them too sloppy, everyone around me thinks I'm insane for this reason More like, party pooper! /S choosne wale Dudhiya malda it just tastes ummm 🤌 Username does not check out! /S 1. Langda 2. Dusseri 3. Chausa Safedaaa ftw Banganapalli is my favourite as well... I think people from the south prefer banganapalli I looked what sindhura looks like. It's not sindhura. If I like to discribe the mango. They are very small. Skin doesn't turn yellow when they ripe only green and pink but also they can be ripe when they're are green. The fibres are super thick and strong, they stuck between your teeth. Super super delicious. If you have eaten \"Langda\", the mango twice as delicious as langda. It's very rare where the fruit gets rippened properly in the tree and falls off. I've not seen this mango sold anywhere in Bengaluru, Mysuru. There is only one tree in my village and I've not seen other one in my life. These mangoes have created my core childhood memory. I like to believe this is the only one of it's kind just like Groot. Badami only and forever & Mancurad of Goa! Sab Not the frozen one for sure 🤣 Amrapalli, Neelam,Langda.I had planted a langda mango tree since 10 years within my compund wall.This year the benign tree gifted around 1 quintal of delicious mangoes enough for us, neighbours, friends and relatives. They are not even worth comparing. Banganpalle is superior. And I no longer even eat Banganpalle because it and every other mango variety pale in comparison once you try Himayat. It is the only variety that I eat now after trying out many varieties from both North and South. Alphonso is overrated and probably due to it being the variety that gets exported. But that has got nothing to do with its taste. A lot of local mango varieties taste better than Alphonso. The mango's that gets exported are the ones that can be exported without damaging them. Of course most of the good Alphonso produce gets exported. But it sill got nothing on other varieties. just be mango and be sweet Naveen ul haq with his sweet mangoes 🫡 Exactly, the look, the tartness and sweetness (sugar balance), smooth texture (almost no fibery threads) makes it the king. It is the real mango flavour (not oversweet stuff which many prefer therefore going for other cheaper varieties), The only challenger I see are certain Thai varieties which are significantly more expensive. In addition lots of fake alphonso in India and most of the good stuff is exported. Unless you have personal contacts in Sindhdurgh or Ratnagiri region in Maharashtra the best you can get are export rejected stuff The correct answer is Banganpalli. 👍 Mancurad Gola mangoooo 😩😩😩 As a Bengali, I am all for Himsagar. Himsagar for the win bhai Himsagar. Have tasted varieties like Langda, Chousa, Dasseri, Kesar, Badami, Imam Pasand, Malgova, Baiganapalli, etc, but, nothing, nothing comes close to the naturally ripened Himsagar aam. overrated no one mentioned our bio safeda😔 Her's Kesar aam supremacy Well how do I say it..........uhh i don't really like mangos Legit it’s the best, it’s called Himayath in Telangana Tapka aam. Safeda Hapus for just eating Badam for aam ras 😋 Alphonso. But safeda is better to eat Yup I start eating mangos when langda arrives in the stores. We call it Desi 😂. I have 3 trees of these mangos Safeda is the best according to me. I prefer mangoes when they are real. Safeda I feel like they don't have any taste. Oh yes. The bestest. Usually a bit more expensive than the rest. Don't judge my people the literal translation is 'Elephant's genital mango'. No I'm not kidding. Kannadigas have wierd fetish about Elephants.😂 You're making me to travel the world just to come to Uttar Pradesh(had to google it) over a fruit which I have no clue what it tastes like. Good job! Maldah Chausa ftw! Tbh all of them. Don't make us choose, plij. Imampasand. Just soo good. Haapus (alphonso) supremacy always. Raspuri from Karnataka, got to have it, delish Alphonso, in my \"personal opinion,\" is overrated. Every type The one that grows in by backyard Bangenpalli is safeda Dussheri and chausa! No jhanjhat of messi hands Kesar , specially it's smell Totapuri 😋 Alphanso and Himsagar for me Safeda 💯💯 Imam Pasand. Buttery goodness without any fibre 🤤 Berserk is the best one Kachi kairi Most of them are fake ones you hardly get the real ones in cities. I guess you never got the taste of real pakka juicy Alphonso. Alphonso Who cares, I'm eatin all of it. Alphonso buddy The one with aadmi at end Mankurad where? Himsagar is just heavenly Kesar it is! Kottukonam mango (Chenka varikka) The mango wars Himsagar,without a shadow of a doubt. Lucknow ki dasheri ftw Alphonso ... I've tried dozens of other varieties, but King of Mangoes it is. 100% safeda! I’m surprised it’s not shown in the pictorial list OP uploaded. I wonder if it is called by some other name? Kesar is my favourite although I haven’t tried some of the ones listed on this chart. What is it called? If it’s from Mangalore, I ate one just this evening! We call it “Nekkare” :) And now I’m eating one right now. Thicc hapus Just today brought some langda. Amazing taste. raw 100 k 2.5 kilo jo bhi mil jaye, sorry i poor saar. *dudhiya maldah* My man Banginapally or nothing. Doodhiya maldah are the real deal .. it's taste is perfect balance of sweetness juicy and pulp Yep. And the guthi is really small too. This name Langda actually makes it sound very unappealing to the people who haven't tasted it.. it should be popular with the name Maldah That's what she said! /S Pics, or didn't happen! /S Safeda for the win Alphonso Mysore Mango ftw. XDXD Himsagar. There are other mangos too like fajil aam, amropali aam I think the biggest problem is that companies which make Mango juice have commercialized and popularized Alphonso Mango so much that everyone thinks its the best mango. In reality Malda/Langda really trumps every Mango. (I have tasted Alphonoso (Hapus), Dasheri and Malda) I prefer Himsagar. For the unknowns: It's an Eastern India novelty. That's just a limited representation, as there are >1000 varieties! Alphonso (hapus) is just so overrated....the whole Alphonso hype in Maharashtra is a scam. Absolutely. It's a scam. This response is also a scam....just like how Alphonso Hapus is. I have heard this reasoning N no. of times, but yet to find that dream hapus. Alphonso is too watery and Dasheri can be too sweet.. but Maldah is perfect.. Dasheri, Kesar & Hapus (Alphanso) People in my area use alphonso to make mango juice. But they also add sugar to it which is really weird. Alphonso is just a brand created by media but the real king is langda or malda. Himsagar and Mallika Any, because for me only the sweetness matters, if the Mango is perfectly ripe I'll happily accept it in my tummy :) That seems to be the right answer! /S Banganpalli >>> also called Safeda. Yes, this is almost never not sweet. Ya, extremely hard to get real ones in India Good one XD. BTW real Alphonso is still over priced for India, because if high export, but best. But extremely hard to find in India. It's easier to buy Indian Alphonso in some countries than India, lol. Pakistani chaunsa"
