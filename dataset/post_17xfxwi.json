        "Honestly, getting anc earbuds has been a gamechanger. No wonder so many people in public spaces are wearing earbuds or headphones. Even if I can hear the person slightly in public space, it is just easy to ignore and move on. So many kids and old ladies begging in the local market. I mean I go there multiple times a week. Even if I give once, it is going to invite more harassment. Ignoring has been the best move.",
        "We are the land of Scams! \n\nOur ingenuity has gravitated towards making a fast buck instead of making a change for the betterment.\n\nNo wonder trust levels amongst the citizens is pathetically low.",
        "There are so many scams around us. I can't even tell who is in need of genuine help, so I end up ignoring any kind of requests. Main toh \"skill issue, mate\" bolke nikal leta hu",
        "So his name is Modela Venkata Dinesh Kumar, he is from Guntur roams around airports in the country scamming people. \n\nHe is a serial offender, scams people gets arrested comes out on bail and start all over again. \n\nGoogle his name and you will see he has been arrested so many times from 2020 to 2023. \n\nBased on few other Tweets and Reddits posts this man has been scamming again this year late November. \n\nStay safe if you come across this garbage, report him to CRPF they will take care of him.",
        "not a fucking solution, what if the person does need help. what if he is speaking the truth. listening doesn't harm anyone.",
        "To those people, I enthusiastically point to the nearest police officer saying that they will help them.",
        "This actually happened to me a while back in IGI, New Delhi. A decent looking student approached me with the same exact reasons. It felt so real that I genuinely felt bad after denying him even a call. Now I feel better considering this is a widespread scam.",
        "I don't know much about law but can you just, regularly come out of jail on bail? Again and again?",
        "have u ever came across such a person in need really? I have and eventually police is called and police helps, police is the solution and not ur money",

        "Honestly this one time someone asked me to pay for their Uber/lend them cash to book an uber. It was the first time it ever happened so i didn't want to assume it's a scam. I started to explain that they can connect to their UPI and pay later when they get back home or something if they can't rn. \n\nThe dude just went away. Didn't even bother saying another word as a response.",
        " you guys are just giving him money or booking his tickets?",
        "The Actual Fuck!!\nSo I googled his name, and he's the same person I encountered a few days back at the airport.\n\nI was flying from Ahmedabad to Goa, and he asked me for 10k to buy a new ticket as he missed his current flight to Hyderabad. He shows his LPU student card, and talks in a very sophisticated manner. He asked me to lend him 10k which he'd return in 5 minutes as his mother was waiting for him outside the airport. I refused to help and later was even guilty about the same.\n\nIncidents like these, and I'm starting to lose trust on strangers.",

I'm generally a dick who doesn't trust people anyway, but there are really sweet people out there trying to genuinely help and I don't want them to lose that trust in people. Most comments here are highlighting exactly what I'm worried about....that we're all better off ignoring and walking away from the plight of people who actually need help\n\n**Raise Awareness**\n\nI didnt lose much(1500) but when I dug a little, I realised some people have lost upwards of 10k  and this was a regular scam with the same MO across domestic terminals in India. These sort of scams are easier to shut down with some sort of awareness because they are stuck in a closed environment...They are physically present and are likely to have spent money on a legit ticket and stuck inside the terminal with no real exit...They are banking on people merely refusing and walking away instead of calling the cops",
