        "If we dig into personal beliefs of every freedom fighter, we would be shocked. \nTheir personal life or beliefs were conservative and should be opposed but not their contribution to Independence struggle.",
        "Didn't he try to get his under aged daughter married to a king or something?",
        "So, Tilak said \" Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it!\". Is his \"Swaraj\" only for men? Is it not needed for women in house too? It proves that his whole idea of Swaraj was incorrect. In such case, we cannot consider his contribution to independence as a great one, but a good thing that happened even if the doer was not having pure thoughts.",
        "that was keshab chandra sen",
        "People were a product of their times expecting them to adhere to modern sensibilities and ethics is very naive.",
        "A lot of the stuff he was opposing was becoming widespread in his time though. Man made a conscious decision to be an arch conservative on the issue of women's rights. He was progressive on the issue of indians being independent. If it's ok to praise the progressivism, it's also ok to criticize the conservatism. And frankly probably ok to believe the conservatism might have been worse than his progressivism.",
        "No human being is perfect.. We all have good and bad behaviours. What is thought wrong in current era wasn't considered wrong in past era and vice versa. A person can be a skilled surgeon but not a good son.. Does it make him any less of a surgeon? No.. Just because he is a skilled surgeon does it justify him not being a good son? No... So yeah people have many faces.. Also OP even our thoughts and views are also shaped by our previous generations.. Be it the positive thoughts or negative thoughts.. All were shaped by mistakes, errors and trials.. Take world War example.. It took us 2 world wars to realise we will be doomed if we have a 3rd one.. Sometimes mistakes (sadly at the cost of lives) have to occur to make us realise how to better ourselves.. Maybe if Tilak ji was born in our era his views would have been similar to ours..",
        "1. We cannot apply 2023's moral standards to someone from 1800's, its a fallacy. Of course, that also does not mean we justify those view's of 1800's in today's time. \n2. When we judge a person from a historic lens, we have to look at the outcome and the contribution of the person to achieve the outcome.\n3. In short, Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a good activist for India's Independence, but not so good social reformer for women's rights.",

        "It is good to point it out like you have, but remember that was more than 100 years ago. We shouldn't apply today's societal standards to them and therefore shouldn't completely villainiess them for something that was (somewhat) accepted back then. \n\n\nThere are similar dark sides to other famous people from different eras:\n\n\n1) Many of the major Founding Fathers of USA owned numerous slaves, such asÂ George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison\n2) Gandhi's celibacy tests\n3) Alexander Graham Bell: Was a major proponent of compulsory sterilization programs\n4) Martin Luther: Had anti semitic views \n5) Henry Ford: Also had anti semitic views \n\n\nHopefully these examples demonstrate that lots of other great people in the past also had flaws, but that doesn't take away their legacy.",
        "It is not the question of era. At the time of Tilak many people were there who encouraged women in education. It is just his closed minded thinking which is disgusting. \n\nSuppose I go by your logic and say for example, that a rapist has donated lakhs and lakhs to orphanage and old age homes. Does it make him a good person? Never. Similarly, a man who did not respect women is not respectable in any manner. \n\nComing to your world war examples, why the world didn't learn its mistake after the first world war? Why it took 2 to learn? According to your logic, all the wrong doings of humans in history can be justified which I strongly oppose.\n\nEven if Tilak was born today, his views would be still regressive. The man who could not open up his mind like his fellow beings of his own time, cannot be expected to be any different if born today.",
        "In 1903, when Gandhi was in South Africa, he wrote that white people there should be \"the predominating race.\" He also said black people \"are troublesome, very dirty and live like animals.\" There's no way around it: Gandhi was a racist early in his life, says his biographer Ramachandra Guha.\n\nGandhi championed women in politics. But he was also obsessed with his own celibacy. In his late 70s, before he died at 78, he slept naked with his grandniece when she was in her late teens. He said he wanted to test his willpower to abstain from sex.\n\n\nYou can find multiple such instances and quotes and writings from various freedom fighters. Societies and people outgrow themselves. I respect Gandhi and what all he did for this country and all these instances will not make me respect him less.",
        "1. I am not applying 2023's moral standard to 1800s. Instead I am applying moral standards of 1800s itself.  If you read carefully, there were people who supported women's education in his time. Its the choice he made which was wrong.\n2. The outcome of his action was delay in women empowerment and his contribution to it is huge.\n3. Given his views against women, his contribution towards independence seems insignificant.",
        "Moral of the story is never idolize anyone.",
        "There is a lot more to Tilak that you won't be able to digest, it's just that Congress chose not to tarnish him like the way current government does.",
        "I am against all of them. Specially Gandhi's celibacy test is so disgusting. He must be punished for doing such filthy acts.",
        "In my opinion, all these instances make Gandhi also a bad person. I never support him or call him Mahatma. He was not good.",
        "Bal Gangadhar Tilak pretty much called Raja Ram Mohan Roy a namard because the latter was campaigning against sati and child marriage of women. Once a child bride died on her wedding night and Tilak said it's not the husband's fault but that the girl was faulty.",
        "Here's what I think. The problem comes when we go into simplistic explanation of complex stuff. We want our heroes to be flawless and we tend to villainise people for their flaws.\nWe should be able to study their contribution in a dispassionate manner. Also we need to realise the time they were in. They are humans and like us all, they are not flawless. Let us celebrate the positive contributions while acknowledging the areas they fell  short. It does not make them less of a hero, but makes them human.\nAnd this applies to any figure in history. View the contribution wholistically especially in context of the time, acknowledge the flaws, and appreciate the positives while giving them grace for being flawed humans like we all are.",
        "According to your logic, if all the criminals start doing good things like donations, social service and also commit crimes on regular basis, will you still say that we need to see their contribution as a whole?  Never. Similarly, we need to call out fallacies of all these so called \"heroes\" and teach our kids how not to be like them.",
        "We all possibly hold views that may come across as shocking in times to come. \n\nA lot of views were still fairly prevalent at the time of independence 50-60 years down the line. It's completely expected that he was a product of his time.",
        "No. He was not product of his time. He lived in times of people who worked for women empowerment. He was just product of his narrow mindedness.",
        "Then we must be praising Britishers too. Because heroes are flawed. They came to India and colonised, for the development of Great Britain. Yes, some Indians died, enslaved, and were left with delay in development for 200 years, but Great Britain and its people prospered, so that when Hitler had come, they ended his fascism. \n\nNo hero is perfect. And so the Britishers.",
        "An Independent activist but with an anachronistic mindset",
        "Way to strawman. It does feel like you are just commenting in bad faith. Its not all black and white and there are shades of grey.",
        "Thats not what I said and you know it. British rule, like all colonialism caused immense pain and exploitation and immeasurable loss and can never be justified.",
        "But it helped defeat Hitler. Without them the Nazis would have expanded their territory and we would be in a much worse situation. Britishers were needed. Winston Churchill was the man of the hour. Yes, because of Winston Churchill, there was a Bengal famine, and it was a tragedy. But, you have to see heroes as flawed. British and Winston Churchill are flawed heroes.",
        "Again, you are deliberately being obtuse. Basically you are arguing against  point I never made. Lets just agree to not engage further  Good day.",
        "We need to take a stand. Being black and white is good. By your logic, all British rulers, Hitler, etc also are grey. It makes every bad guy in history a grey person.",
        "I agree. Take a stand after considering all factors and take a stand on specific situations. For me, Tilak had positive contribution in the pre Gandhi era freedom struggle and he had regressive social beliefs. Lets acknowledge both.\n\nGandhi, complex again. Contribution in freedon struggle, social reforms, arguably bad husband and father. had some crazy beliefs.\n\nAgain, deliberately misrepresenting my point. Both nazism and colonialism were exploitative and can't be justified.",
        "You got my point too.\n\nMost britishers respect Winston Churchill. They do say he was the man of the hour. He is their war hero. They do accept he is flawed for his responsibility in Bengal famine. He is their flawed hero.\n\nJust like how Bal Gangadhar Tilak is your flawed hero.\n\nYou and a white britisher share the same ideology and belief. The only difference is, you don't accept this flawed hero ideology, when your community was directly oppressed. You just don't see women as your community. Because you identify with the oppressor.",
        "Stupid post equating society and times in 19th and 20th century to this day and age. No freedom fighter or hero was a feminist. But that doesn't mean they were misogynists either. Times were different. Simple.",
        "I would prefer the british rulers then if this was going to be the treatment to fellow natives. Women rights were already centuries old. Ram Mohan Roy lived 80 years before him, Bal did not even exist. And he was anti-Dalit. If Bal was born today he would make Yogi a saint.",
        "I totally get where you are coming from. \n\nI think the tilak example just showed my own bias. For me his net contribution was positive and I can totally see how someone else can legitimately disagree. Legacy can be complex. \n\nMy main point was about acknowledgement of both good and bad. Its never meant to make it 'equal'. Bad can outnumber good by manifold and vice versa.\nThis has actually given me food for thought and i will internally deliberate more about it. thanks. good day.",
        "Omg, never meet your heroes.",
        "Basically he wanted freedom for half of Indians only.",
        "So dont.. no one forced you to idolize him.",
        "Wiki is trash, the content on it can be edited by anyone easily, so If I were you I'd look for more information on it by reading books and other reliable sources of information.",
        "While accepting that theyâre flawed individuals is the right way to go. We donât need to give them grace, honest criticism and reevaluating how / why we revere the figures in Indiaâs freedom movement is sufficient. I also disagree with the OP seething rage but itâs fine people can have all kinds of opinions.",
        "Tilak was basically Ben Shapiro of those times.\nHe was pissed about the British taking away the Brahman rule of peshwai, so he was anti-British.\nHe was quite reactionary.\n\nHe said swarajya is \"my\" birthright, not \"our\".\n\nAmbedkar said, if anyone was true Lokmanya, it was Shridhar Tilak (his son who was pushed to suicide, read about him).",
        "Op you are expecting perfection and your views are idealistic. I can understand that you want to take a stand against this regressiveness and dont want to put a medal on someone who has his flaws as well. But is there anyone without flaws? \n\n>It is not the question of era. At the time of Tilak many people were there who encouraged women in education. It is just his closed minded thinking which is disgusting. \n\n\nYes there were. And he could have been a better person, but he wasn't. Maybe because of his upbringing, the environment he grew upon his views remained like that. But you must understand we can't expect everyone belonging to an era to be the same . It isn't plausible. Like I said earlier not all are perfect. You can call out someone for their flaws but you can't undermine their efforts they took for the people during that era. \n\n>\n\nSuppose I go by your logic and say for example, that a rapist has donated lakhs and lakhs to orphanage and old age homes. Does it make him a good person? Never. Similarly, a man who did not respect women is not respectable in any manner. \n\nI guess you are not understanding what I am trying to say here. In my comment I said everyone has both the good and bad.. I by no means justifying his views. Yeah we can call him out for his views but can't undermine the sacrifices he made. Also What I m trying to say, judging someone of the past through modern lens isn't completely right. Each person and each generation have their own set of flaws. The next generation learns from it and tries not to repeat it. Our lives either become an inspiration for others or lesson for others. \n\n>Coming to your world war examples, why the world didn't learn its mistake after the first world war? Why it took 2 to learn? According to your logic, all the wrong doings of humans in history can be justified which I strongly oppose.\n\n\"sigh\" No one is justifying their mistakes lol.. That is why we are learning history. So that we don't repeat them again... NO human is BORN PERFECT Or LIVES PERFECTLY.. Even our generation has its flaws.. Who knows some of the practices we do now might be look down upon by future generations.. That's HOW WE EVOLVE into better people and society.. You can't learn to walk without falling or getting dirty.. Sadly that's how the world and life is.. Change is constant and this will never change.. \n\n>Even if Tilak was born today, his views would be still regressive. The man who could not open up his mind like his fellow beings of his own time, cannot be expected to be any different if born today.\n\n\nKindly read again what I typed in my 1st comment.. I said that if Tilak ji was born in this era he might have had views similar to ours.. Who knows how we would have been if we were born in his era.. What guarantee is there that we would have held modern views in his era? The thoughts, views that we hold are all the product of the past of the world, our society, our education, our upbringing, the environment we have lived and our life experiences.",
        "What are these 2023 moral standards the comment section is talking about.Damn bro i did not know that recognizing almost 60% of population deserve human rights ,was such a revolutionary idea and that no human brain couldnt comprehend prior to 2020.\n\nThe guy was a casteist and sexist.If he is a product of his times,he does not need to be taught to children.There are numerous other commendable legends who deserves the spotlight.I remember he was given more attention and significance than Shaheed Bhagat Singh.Revolutionary heroes are the ones who are ahead of time and has the hindsight to be the ones to make a change.",
        "Yeah OP doesn't want to acknowledge his contribution to freedom struggle.. You can call him out for his views on women but that doesn't mean you shouldn't acknowledge his efforts in freedom struggle.",
        "Yes  I might have some thinking to do about my own beliefs. Im learning.",
        "Also look at historical figures in a dispassionate way.. Acknowledge their achievements, flaws and make sure to carry on their legacy EXCEPT their flaws. \nOp doesn't seem to understand the intricate nature of humans. World isn't an ideal society. Cant expect it to be when, we the people who make up the society are imperfect. The whole world is a grey area",
        "Ahhh we are back to cancelling people after 100 years!",
        "Under the British getting the perfect freedom fighter was not a choice.\nEveryone who rebelled was welcome and they helped in expelling the foregin rule irrespective of their ideology. If you go in detail lot of them have faults. I personally could never think of netaji subhash chandra bose in positive light. How could you ally with Nazis ans Japanese despite knowing how they treated India POWs and other vile things. But that's the point. Indians Never had the choice. Common foe United us all and hence they all are national heroes.\nWe have had a choice to choose the best after 1947. And hence I think 47 is a crucial junction from where the parameters for being a national heroe changed.\n\nJust my personal opinion tho.",
        "And that was more than what British gave us",
        "No. Neither am I expecting perfection nor my views are too idealistic. Expecting the basic common sense from this influential person seems to be so \"idealistic\" in your lens!! \n\nThanks for agreeing that he could have been better person but he was not.\n\nI am not expecting everyone in an era to be same. But atleast a person who runs two daily newspapers in english and Marathi language must have a little common sense while talking about women. We cannot put the blame entirely on upbringing and environment. He was educated and he could have read the books and grown his thoughts but he didn't and kept narrow mindedness. \n\n\"Everyone has good and bad\" you said. In that case all terrorists, rapists, murderers etc must also be sympathised based on your logic. \n\nI do not care of the sacrifices he did, because women lost so many years of development because of men like him. Shame on him.\n\nYour last para of what if we were born in his era and what if he was born in our era is all again a repetition. He was well educated and had every capacity to support women but he chose not to. Hence if he was in this era too, his views would be regressive. Let me repeat, I am not judging him through MODERN LENS. I am comparing him with his fellow men of same era and saying he was not upto the mark.",
        "I agree with you.",

        "Yes he wasn't upto the mark as per our expectations but for the people of his era, he was their hero. Don't try to idolise him. ACKNOWLEDGE his efforts, need not respect his views on women. Look at historical figures in a dispassionate way.. \n\nLol I keep saying that NO ONE IS PERFECT.. Are all educated people  perfect? Come on tell me... Haven't you come across any educated person with regressive views in today's society..?? Then how can you expect in past society? Lol you are being idealistic without even realizing it. \nAlso NO ONE IS SYMPATHIZING with law breakers.. NO ONE\nThe one flaw that i find in your post and which made me comment is how you claim that he shouldn't be respected for his efforts on freedom struggle. You are basically tarnishing him entirely only for his views on women.. But then again you are a imperfect person just like me and Tilak..",

But she heard about the backward and oppressive conditions in which Indian women lived in through her brother, who was an officer posted in India. She started a college for women in South India with her personal funds.

However, within that whirlpool, there is an underlying respect/need for precisely the same goods that I don't want us to carelessly discard (working for the upliftment of others, being able to stand up to oppression, etc.). Actions are not entirely divorced from individuals, and when we fail to acknowledge a positive, we are ultimately devaluing the good itself.",

But they were the first to establish terms like \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\", which became vital inspiration for later movements for human rights, including the Indian freedom struggle.\n\nPeople like Gandhi and Tilak stand for our freedom struggle.

        "That would presume that oppression is all men did. The fact (and the tragedy) of evil is its deceptive nature. For many, it becomes something natural that cannot be/doesn't have to be changed. Humans once blindly attacked each other for food and believed that subjugating a nation was a moral good. To go from that to believing in the right of each nation to exist independently is no mean feat. It isn't \"meaningless\" to help fellow human beings who, despite their flaws, are still capable of having meaningful bonds and experiencing love.\n\nWhen your mind is occupied with when the police will come knocking at your door and when your next protest is going to be, you do not get much time to read. Again, I agree that he should have done better. All I am pointing out that there are multiple elements involved that cannot be ignored.\n\nBasic decency is an ever-changing idea. Once upon a time, it would have been enough to not brutally attack others. Then, it became more sophisticated and turned into a need for actively helping those around us. Finally, ethics gained an international nature that went beyond narrow walls. In each scenario, there was some good and some bad (though, objectively speaking, the latter was probably higher).

Moreover, you need not read books to see what women and dalit were undergoing. It's enough if you have compassion in heart which he clearly lacked.\n\nFinally we cannot separate the consequences from the character of men and women we are discussing.

If one is busy organising people, managing massive events, and also writing books, there isn't much time left. A more holistic person would have seen that women and Dalits also needed attention, but this doesn't mean that good wasn't done.\n\nI agree that on the matter of women empowerment and Dalit empowerment, he ultimately failed. However, the reason I will continue to emphasise the need to separate consequences and character is because the latter does not always accurately demonstrate a person's morality. A simple example would be a drunk driver hitting someone vs. someone intentionally doing so despite not being influenced by any substance. It would be short-sighted to think that one's motives make the consequences pointless, but I think that it would be equally bad to solely focus on the results. If we did so, we would make an extremely punishing society that would needlessly deprecate good actions as people would often doubt all of their actions and wonder if there was much point in acting at all (as they could still be missing something).",

But it's possible that if you dig deep enough you might find something about them that is not acceptable today.\n\nSubash Chandra Bose is also respected as a great freedom fighter, but he tried to form a Nazi alliance.\n\nIt just goes to show that no one is perfect and that we cannot idolize anyone, especially not a historical figure.",

Could one argue that more could have been done? Of course. But what remains is distinct from what survives.\n\nI never denied that he did not. I already acknowledged that the harm done in both cases cannot be ignored, but I think that most people would agree that there is something uniquely evil about a person consciously sitting in the driver's seat and meticulously planning how they would end a person's life. This is not the same as a man, who was perhaps saddened by his family's circumstances, carelessly drinking and then driving. The difference lies in the degree of carelessness. Life is complex and diversity cannot be underestimated.\n\nI would say that independence is of utmost importance. Colonialism did not merely strip people of economic resources, but also any fundamental sense of belonging to one's land. At the deepest level, the national spirit is eroded completely. When this happens, even if there are temporary gains, everyone loses in the long term.

I'll repost two meaningful comments from an old [post with primary source](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/nqoqbl/til_of_rukhmabai_and_phulamanibai_cases_where_two/?sort=top):\n\n\nFirst:\n\n\n>It's not by today's standards. Back then there were movements, arguments against this bullshit. He chose not to get into them because he's not the one getting raped to death. 2. One incident isn't fair? So if a rapist just rapes once, he should not be judged for that? 3. It's not just a ridiculous statement he made in private, though even that would be bad. It's a national case where a ten years old child was raped to death and he defended that. He in fact, took a public position where government couldn't prevent such situations. He opposed the law to increase age of consent. I'm just confused and horrified that how many times have you blamed a dead rape girl that you feel like this is a silly statement? 4. And 13-14 and ten years old, there's a lot of difference between these years. It seems just three four, but most girls at least enter puberty by the age of 13, so while it's not perfect, 13-14 sounds much better. Holy fucking hell women are worse than animals and it's no wonder why. Defense of fucking kids is seen as something 'silly'. BTW is there anything this country won't forgive if it's done by an upper caste man? Also again, there were several people who pointed out just how shitty girls marriage was, people like him chose to ignore that. Dude you're forgetting that periyar, ambedkar, phule were ancient too.\n\n\n2nd:\n\n\n>Are you sure its not confirmation bias from school history. There's a difference between following some societal rules silently, and being vehemently against change, openly supporting oppressors. Bal was pretty right wing conservative in that regard. And if you see today's majority thought and rural society in India, it hasn't much change. Will we excuse Savarkar, Modi and Yogi too since their upbringing was similar to that era.\n\n>Rukhmabai got pardoned by Empress Victoria herself and went on to become one of India's first women doctors. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a century before Bal Gangadhar. Don't say there was no humanism/feminism in that era. While these people were fighting for feminism and change, Bal was vocally anti.\n\n>Also 13 and 11 are far apart. 11 is literally pre-pubescent and no child has any reason to get married at that phase. By that logic, keep going young and marrying a 3yr old would be okay.",

He is studied and respected for his role in the freedom struggle, not women's rights and textbooks focusing on the former only is a non issue for the same reason.

        "You do realize why it was needed to give favorable divorce rights to women? It's because the patriarchical system didn't ever allow women to get financial independence. For example, a boy's education was always prioritized over a girl's in any non-affluent household. A girl is infact killed on birth because people don't want girls.\n\nIf not for laws, women's lives would be way, way worse.",

Unlike Tilak he supported educating women, but only so far as to make them better at running the household and being better mothers who raise patriotic children.",
        "Many people were aware of that treatment. Bose being deep in it must have known at least more than normal people. The only thing he might have been unaware of maybe was the cannabalism of Indian troops by Japanese.\n\nBut my concern is not that. Mine is, did Bose really think that after liberation from British the Japs would just leave us and go back? We would have end up with something worse than British Raj.",

I don't think that there is sufficient evidence to say that the primary reason why Mr Tilak was advocating for independence was to oppress someone. In fact, the easiest way to do so would have been to try to convince the British how useful it would be if the Indian elite and the Brahmins delayed independence for the sake of controlling a large number of people. After 1857, the British government would have quite glad for such a suggestion.

I m not saying Hitler should be spared because of animal protection laws.. Let's know that he passed such laws but ALSO KNOW of the crimes he committed.. This itself is an example of how everyone has both positive and negative in them..Hitler predominantly acted in a negative inhuman ways that should be punished. \n\nI have no issues if Tilak ji is being called out for his views.. Yeah he wasn't the perfect man... Had this post has been just pointing out one of the many sides of a man we learnt in history, I have no qualms.. But a man of the past is being judged via current era. Also his other efforts towards society is being undermined because of one of his many views. Like someone said earlier, we shouldn't idolise... Know the man wasn't the perfect, just like us and he did what he could for the society back then. The best we can do in life to move forward as a society is to know the good and bad of everything (as much as possible) and try to inculcate the positives and throw away those negatives in our lives.",

So we shouldn't respect him. Nehru ji also took many wrong decisions so should we disrespect him. Even you at some point maybe did something wrong so should you be hated for that one thing? In textbooks we should praise Gangadhar for his good deeds and criticize him for the bad.",

It is era & society/culture dependent.\n\nIn an era when entire freaking world's societies existed on a sexist spectrum, the Normalization principle is in effect.\n\nOne judges sexists today with a rightfully harsh lens because the wider society at large/scale (not just global norms but our own Legal norms, like Constitution) has taken a different turn & moved on/evolved. \n\nHence Tilak's position \"in Freedom Movement\" is fine enough as it is. \n\nIf a ranking were to be created for \"Best Non-Sexists\" then Tilak being positioned high on that list would be a different argument.

Of course, he was far from the great hero those in the West think he was. However, if he had not resisted the Nazi onslaught and not decided against having any alliance with them, humanity would have faced a much darker future. Europe would have been lost, and the number of deaths could have doubled as rhe Nazis went on unhindered. On the Bengal famine, I think that the following excerpt provides an interesting counterview:\n\n\"By January 1944, Bengal had received a total of 130,000 tons of barley from Iraq, 80,000 tons of wheat from Australia and 10,000 from Canada, followed by a further 100,000 from Australia. Then, on 14 February 1944, Churchill called an emergency meeting of the war cabinet to see if more food aid could be sent to Bengal without wrecking Allied plans for the coming Normandy landings. âI will certainly help you all I can, but you must not ask the impossible,â  telegraphed Wavell before the cabinet met.\n\nâhttps://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/masani-bengal-famine/\n\nThe website most likely tries to whitewash Churchill, but some basic facts are probably unaltered.\n\nI am proud of humanity irrespective of when, where, and how it comes into being. This is why I feel honoured to live at a time when there are compassionate people like you in the world. Sometimes, it feels as if unrestricted materialism and consumerism have subdued all moral impulses. However, the passion and dedication of you and others here is a reminder that all is far from lost.

But we have to bear in mind that we have to reform the masses and if we dissociate ourselves from them, reforms would become impossible.

Also, you may know some history I don't know and vice versa. \n\nI couldn't find any reference to \" Bal Gangadhar Tilak pretty much called Raja Ram Mohan Roy a namard \" and while thanks to you, I know a bit more about his son's suicide, I really don't see relation between Tilak calling guy namard and his suicide.\n\nI will await source from someone then. Thanks.",
        "That doesn't change the fact that he had a significant role in the freedom struggle.",
        "No he was NOT GREAT. A man who supports a person for killing a 11 year old girl by having sexual intercourse can NEVER BE GREAT. I have already said that if there is none in history who can be respected, then be it. Lets not respect cheap mentality people.",
        "This just says that he had significant role in delaying progress of Indian society.",
        "No. this says he could've had a bigger role in the development of Indian society but it didn't. \n\n\nNow you asked why he is considered a national hero. He is considered that for his role in freedom of India, unless you can prove that he had not role in freedom of India any argument you make is moot.",

        "Yeah his idea of freedom is only wrong. Freedom where he does not value women of house. Freedom where he can practice untouchability with dalits. If this was the mindset with which he carried out each of his dharnas or activities, then his actions must not be appropriated at all. \nHe was a HUGE hindrance to India and its progression or development.",
        "Shit men are shit men. That's all.",
        "Ok you can leave it here.",
        "That doesn't change the fact that he had a significant role in the freedom struggle.",
        "Yes it does. Time to see him as hindrance than enabler.",
        "Nope. Social progress  != freedom.",
        "Yes it is. Freedom and progress go hand in hand.",
        "So why neglect the freedom part?",
        "Because what he did was to give illusion of fighting for freedom whereas in real all he did was hindering the progress.",

        "What oppressor mindset ? He actually promoted public celebration of  Ganeshotsav & Shiv jayanti to unite people on public forums and create a strong united voice against oppressive British rule. \n\nHe opened schools to educate kids in maths and English. Does that sound oppressive to you. Just because some of his views are opposite of your views don't make him a bad guy.",
        "He opposed the establishment of first native girls high school in Pune. If he was a good man, he wouldn't have done it. You said he opened school for kids. Then are girl kids not fit ? Is it what his thought process? Why he opposed opening of girls school? He was a hypocrite. \nYou say British as oppressors but not Tilak. This is so wrong. Both were equally bad. \nIf he wanted to unite public, he could have supported the reforms against untouchability which he didn't . Hence he does not deserve any respect.",
        "Can you give me any source that he opposed a girl's school?",
        "It's in the post itself.",
        "Where is the post taken from ?\n\nI have read articles & stories about Tilak regularly since I live in Mumbai. I have never read/heard about this story involving the Young girlÅ death. I kno about his conservative views about hindu religion & traditions. I kno that he opposed many laws because he didnt want British & other non hindus to make decisions for Hindus. But I have never heard/read about these extreme views described in the article.",

        "By your logic Islam religion would not exist. \"Aisha was 6 or 7 yrs old during her marriage that makes him a pedo so people who follow that religion are pedos\". What kind of logic r u implying? \"Einstein married his cousin so anyone who studies relativity likes incest\". If any person is dumb enough to follow that logic them no single human being deserves recognition. Not everyone are saints. Or r u saying that u r a perfect human being?",
        "I believe that they should specify more details of their bad sides too, while it's true he fought fir nation it's also true he was an Orthodox hindu and a misogynist. When students will learn both sides they will learn to weight these so called great freedom fighters themselves, but it's not gonna happen since texts like these are also meant to invoke a national spirit inside the students.",
        "Also now you know what kinda effect education can have on a students mind, and now you know why some people were pissed over exclusion of some chaoters from ncert. (I don't support anyone, I support reason, I am not saying whether it was right or wrong to remove those chapters) ð",

        "op is saying exactly that. If you are showing his good side in text books then his other side must be shown as well. Let there be debates in classroom and let students decide which side had more weightage. This is how one should learn history. Unfortunately we are taught just to follow someone blindly because he participated in freedom struggle, with their horrible side completely supressed.

meaningless help fellow human beings despite flaws still capable meaningful bonds experiencing love mind occupied police come knocking door next protest going get much time read agree done better pointing multiple elements involved ignored basic decency everchanging idea upon time would enough brutally attack others became sophisticated turned need actively helping around us finally ethics gained international nature went beyond narrow walls scenario good bad though objectively speaking latter probably higher separate consequences character men women discussing former undeniable truth latter complex reality incorporates limits knowledge intentions biases etc justified agree thats reward murderer donating kidney hang would also recommend following articles regarding mahatma gandhi agree progress human race made collectively since origin mankind let us broaden scope discussion extent second para told mind occupied thoughts like police come knocking door enough time think read

future sad read said comments lets take gandhi separate post compared bad deeds contributions seem insignificant think broaden scope reach misguided conclusions believing one truly willing work freedom others without compassion also sometimes people deliberately suppress feelings go biases statement answers question one busy organising people managing massive events also writing books isnt much time left holistic person would seen women dalits also needed attention doesnt mean good wasnt done agree matter women empowerment dalit empowerment ultimately failed however reason continue emphasise need separate consequences character latter always accurately demonstrate persons morality simple example would drunk driver hitting someone vs someone intentionally despite influenced substance would shortsighted think ones motives make consequences pointless think would equally bad solely focus results would make extremely punishing society would needlessly deprecate good actions people would often doubt actions wonder much point acting could still missing something yeah good manipulation expecting human treat fellow human properly big expectation seems good explanation people th century fighting dalit women oppression saying high expectation th century nice may biased believe people actually good striving independence way matter ones flaws objective good considering example gave leads believe dont idolise u cant ignore things hes done im saying general particular person bad deeds committed must neutralise good deeds must know decide dont think need extensive discussion topic article covers controversial aspect one rest central point remains change fact taking bullet ahimsa unlikely accomplished many men usually inspire others end lives enticing violence towards others able greater good fellow man logic muslim league also strived independence going british revolters wanting put bahadur shah zafar back throne never said one striving independence first yeah minority population arguing womens rights understanding history problem human mistakes like everyone else one founders swaraj movement tbh believe sri aurobindo rai considered starter movement

    "light_cleaned_title": "Why should we consider Bal Gnagadhar Tilak as national hero given his views against women?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I remember reading about Lal-Bal-Pal trio in childhood history as great freedom fighters. Now when I went through the wikipedia page on Tilak, I was sad for even considering him a leader given his views on women. Below is the screenshot of wikipedia page. &#x200B; [Tilak's view against women](https://preview.redd.it/4mvayw3co9bb1.png?width=1243&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db434b6debb94615d2bd8350221c03a5ed5df5cd) In school texts, his real face must be shown to kids and told not to follow him.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "If we dig into personal beliefs of every freedom fighter, we would be shocked. Their personal life or beliefs were conservative and should be opposed but not their contribution to Independence struggle. Didn't he try to get his under aged daughter married to a king or something? So, Tilak said \" Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it!\". Is his \"Swaraj\" only for men? Is it not needed for women in house too? It proves that his whole idea of Swaraj was incorrect. In such case, we cannot consider his contribution to independence as a great one, but a good thing that happened even if the doer was not having pure thoughts. that was keshab chandra sen People were a product of their times expecting them to adhere to modern sensibilities and ethics is very naive. A lot of the stuff he was opposing was becoming widespread in his time though. Man made a conscious decision to be an arch conservative on the issue of women's rights. He was progressive on the issue of indians being independent. If it's ok to praise the progressivism, it's also ok to criticize the conservatism. And frankly probably ok to believe the conservatism might have been worse than his progressivism. No human being is perfect.. We all have good and bad behaviours. What is thought wrong in current era wasn't considered wrong in past era and vice versa. A person can be a skilled surgeon but not a good son.. Does it make him any less of a surgeon? No.. Just because he is a skilled surgeon does it justify him not being a good son? No... So yeah people have many faces.. Also OP even our thoughts and views are also shaped by our previous generations.. Be it the positive thoughts or negative thoughts.. All were shaped by mistakes, errors and trials.. Take world War example.. It took us 2 world wars to realise we will be doomed if we have a 3rd one.. Sometimes mistakes (sadly at the cost of lives) have to occur to make us realise how to better ourselves.. Maybe if Tilak ji was born in our era his views would have been similar to ours.. 1. We cannot apply 2023's moral standards to someone from 1800's, its a fallacy. Of course, that also does not mean we justify those view's of 1800's in today's time. 2. When we judge a person from a historic lens, we have to look at the outcome and the contribution of the person to achieve the outcome. 3. In short, Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a good activist for India's Independence, but not so good social reformer for women's rights. 1.

In short, Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a good activist for India's Independence, but not so good social reformer for women's rights. It is good to point it out like you have, but remember that was more than 100 years ago. We shouldn't apply today's societal standards to them and therefore shouldn't completely villainiess them for something that was (somewhat) accepted back then. There are similar dark sides to other famous people from different eras: 1) Many of the major Founding Fathers of USA owned numerous slaves, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison 2) Gandhi's celibacy tests 3) Alexander Graham Bell: Was a major proponent of compulsory sterilization programs 4) Martin Luther: Had anti semitic views 5) Henry Ford: Also had anti semitic views Hopefully these examples demonstrate that lots of other great people in the past also had flaws, but that doesn't take away their legacy. It is not the question of era. At the time of Tilak many people were there who encouraged women in education. It is just his closed minded thinking which is disgusting. Suppose I go by your logic and say for example, that a rapist has donated lakhs and lakhs to orphanage and old age homes. Does it make him a good person? Never. Similarly, a man who did not respect women is not respectable in any manner. Coming to your world war examples, why the world didn't learn its mistake after the first world war? Why it took 2 to learn? According to your logic, all the wrong doings of humans in history can be justified which I strongly oppose. Even if Tilak was born today, his views would be still regressive. The man who could not open up his mind like his fellow beings of his own time, cannot be expected to be any different if born today. In 1903, when Gandhi was in South Africa, he wrote that white people there should be \"the predominating race.\" He also said black people \"are troublesome, very dirty and live like animals.\" There's no way around it: Gandhi was a racist early in his life, says his biographer Ramachandra Guha. Gandhi championed women in politics. But he was also obsessed with his own celibacy. In his late 70s, before he died at 78, he slept naked with his grandniece when she was in her late teens. He said he wanted to test his willpower to abstain from sex. You can find multiple such instances and quotes and writings from various freedom fighters. Societies and people outgrow themselves. I respect Gandhi and what all he did for this country and all these instances will not make me respect him less. 1. I am not applying 2023's moral standard to 1800s. Instead I am applying moral standards of 1800s itself. If you read carefully, there were people who supported women's education in his time. Its the choice he made which was wrong. 2. The outcome of his action was delay in women empowerment and his contribution to it is huge. 3. Given his views against women, his contribution towards independence seems insignificant. Moral of the story is never idolize anyone. There is a lot more to Tilak that you won't be able to digest, it's just that Congress chose not to tarnish him like the way current government does. I am against all of them. Specially Gandhi's celibacy test is so disgusting. He must be punished for doing such filthy acts. In my opinion, all these instances make Gandhi also a bad person. I never support him or call him Mahatma. He was not good. Bal Gangadhar Tilak pretty much called Raja Ram Mohan Roy a namard because the latter was campaigning against sati and child marriage of women. Once a child bride died on her wedding night and Tilak said it's not the husband's fault but that the girl was faulty. Here's what I think. The problem comes when we go into simplistic explanation of complex stuff. We want our heroes to be flawless and we tend to villainise people for their flaws. We should be able to study their contribution in a dispassionate manner. Also we need to realise the time they were in. They are humans and like us all, they are not flawless. Let us celebrate the positive contributions while acknowledging the areas they fell short. It does not make them less of a hero, but makes them human. And this applies to any figure in history. View the contribution wholistically especially in context of the time, acknowledge the flaws, and appreciate the positives while giving them grace for being flawed humans like we all are. According to your logic, if all the criminals start doing good things like donations, social service and also commit crimes on regular basis, will you still say that we need to see their contribution as a whole? Never. Similarly, we need to call out fallacies of all these so called \"heroes\" and teach our kids how not to be like them. We all possibly hold views that may come across as shocking in times to come. A lot of views were still fairly prevalent at the time of independence 50-60 years down the line. It's completely expected that he was a product of his time. No. He was not product of his time. He lived in times of people who worked for women empowerment. He was just product of his narrow mindedness. Then we must be praising Britishers too. Because heroes are flawed. They came to India and colonised, for the development of Great Britain. Yes, some Indians died, enslaved, and were left with delay in development for 200 years, but Great Britain and its people prospered, so that when Hitler had come, they ended his fascism. No hero is perfect. And so the Britishers. An Independent activist but with an anachronistic mindset Way to strawman. It does feel like you are just commenting in bad faith. Its not all black and white and there are shades of grey. Thats not what I said and you know it. British rule, like all colonialism caused immense pain and exploitation and immeasurable loss and can never be justified. But it helped defeat Hitler. Without them the Nazis would have expanded their territory and we would be in a much worse situation. Britishers were needed. Winston Churchill was the man of the hour. Yes, because of Winston Churchill, there was a Bengal famine, and it was a tragedy. But, you have to see heroes as flawed. British and Winston Churchill are flawed heroes. Again, you are deliberately being obtuse. Basically you are arguing against point I never made. Lets just agree to not engage further Good day. We need to take a stand. Being black and white is good. By your logic, all British rulers, Hitler, etc also are grey. It makes every bad guy in history a grey person. I agree. Take a stand after considering all factors and take a stand on specific situations. For me, Tilak had positive contribution in the pre Gandhi era freedom struggle and he had regressive social beliefs. Lets acknowledge both. Gandhi, complex again. Contribution in freedon struggle, social reforms, arguably bad husband and father. had some crazy beliefs. Again, deliberately misrepresenting my point. Both nazism and colonialism were exploitative and can't be justified. You got my point too. Most britishers respect Winston Churchill. They do say he was the man of the hour. He is their war hero. They do accept he is flawed for his responsibility in Bengal famine. He is their flawed hero. Just like how Bal Gangadhar Tilak is your flawed hero. You and a white britisher share the same ideology and belief. The only difference is, you don't accept this flawed hero ideology, when your community was directly oppressed. You just don't see women as your community. Because you identify with the oppressor. Stupid post equating society and times in 19th and 20th century to this day and age. No freedom fighter or hero was a feminist. But that doesn't mean they were misogynists either. Times were different. Simple. I would prefer the british rulers then if this was going to be the treatment to fellow natives. Women rights were already centuries old. Ram Mohan Roy lived 80 years before him, Bal did not even exist. And he was anti-Dalit. If Bal was born today he would make Yogi a saint. I totally get where you are coming from. I think the tilak example just showed my own bias. For me his net contribution was positive and I can totally see how someone else can legitimately disagree. Legacy can be complex. My main point was about acknowledgement of both good and bad. Its never meant to make it 'equal'. Bad can outnumber good by manifold and vice versa. This has actually given me food for thought and i will internally deliberate more about it. thanks. good day. Omg, never meet your heroes. Basically he wanted freedom for half of Indians only. So dont.. no one forced you to idolize him. Wiki is trash, the content on it can be edited by anyone easily, so If I were you I'd look for more information on it by reading books and other reliable sources of information. While accepting that theyâre flawed individuals is the right way to go. We donât need to give them grace, honest criticism and reevaluating how / why we revere the figures in Indiaâs freedom movement is sufficient. I also disagree with the OP seething rage but itâs fine people can have all kinds of opinions. Tilak was basically Ben Shapiro of those times. He was pissed about the British taking away the Brahman rule of peshwai, so he was anti-British. He was quite reactionary. He said swarajya is \"my\" birthright, not \"our\". Ambedkar said, if anyone was true Lokmanya, it was Shridhar Tilak (his son who was pushed to suicide, read about him). Op you are expecting perfection and your views are idealistic. I can understand that you want to take a stand against this regressiveness and dont want to put a medal on someone who has his flaws as well. But is there anyone without flaws? >It is not the question of era. At the time of Tilak many people were there who encouraged women in education. It is just his closed minded thinking which is disgusting. Yes there were. And he could have been a better person, but he wasn't. Maybe because of his upbringing, the environment he grew upon his views remained like that. But you must understand we can't expect everyone belonging to an era to be the same . It isn't plausible. Like I said earlier not all are perfect. You can call out someone for their flaws but you can't undermine their efforts they took for the people during that era. > Suppose I go by your logic and say for example, that a rapist has donated lakhs and lakhs to orphanage and old age homes. Does it make him a good person? Never. Similarly, a man who did not respect women is not respectable in any manner. I guess you are not understanding what I am trying to say here. In my comment I said everyone has both the good and bad.. I by no means justifying his views. Yeah we can call him out for his views but can't undermine the sacrifices he made. Also What I m trying to say, judging someone of the past through modern lens isn't completely right. Each person and each generation have their own set of flaws. The next generation learns from it and tries not to repeat it. Our lives either become an inspiration for others or lesson for others. >Coming to your world war examples, why the world didn't learn its mistake after the first world war? Why it took 2 to learn? According to your logic, all the wrong doings of humans in history can be justified which I strongly oppose. \"sigh\" No one is justifying their mistakes lol.. That is why we are learning history. So that we don't repeat them again... NO human is BORN PERFECT Or LIVES PERFECTLY.. Even our generation has its flaws.. Who knows some of the practices we do now might be look down upon by future generations.. That's HOW WE EVOLVE into better people and society.. You can't learn to walk without falling or getting dirty.. Sadly that's how the world and life is.. Change is constant and this will never change.. >Even if Tilak was born today, his views would be still regressive. The man who could not open up his mind like his fellow beings of his own time, cannot be expected to be any different if born today. Kindly read again what I typed in my 1st comment.. I said that if Tilak ji was born in this era he might have had views similar to ours.. Who knows how we would have been if we were born in his era.. What guarantee is there that we would have held modern views in his era? The thoughts, views that we hold are all the product of the past of the world, our society, our education, our upbringing, the environment we have lived and our life experiences. What are these 2023 moral standards the comment section is talking about.Damn bro i did not know that recognizing almost 60% of population deserve human rights ,was such a revolutionary idea and that no human brain couldnt comprehend prior to 2020. The guy was a casteist and sexist.If he is a product of his times,he does not need to be taught to children.There are numerous other commendable legends who deserves the spotlight.I remember he was given more attention and significance than Shaheed Bhagat Singh.Revolutionary heroes are the ones who are ahead of time and has the hindsight to be the ones to make a change. Yeah OP doesn't want to acknowledge his contribution to freedom struggle.. You can call him out for his views on women but that doesn't mean you shouldn't acknowledge his efforts in freedom struggle. Yes I might have some thinking to do about my own beliefs. Im learning. Also look at historical figures in a dispassionate way.. Acknowledge their achievements, flaws and make sure to carry on their legacy EXCEPT their flaws. Op doesn't seem to understand the intricate nature of humans. World isn't an ideal society. Cant expect it to be when, we the people who make up the society are imperfect. The whole world is a grey area Ahhh we are back to cancelling people after 100 years! Under the British getting the perfect freedom fighter was not a choice. Everyone who rebelled was welcome and they helped in expelling the foregin rule irrespective of their ideology. If you go in detail lot of them have faults. I personally could never think of netaji subhash chandra bose in positive light. How could you ally with Nazis ans Japanese despite knowing how they treated India POWs and other vile things. But that's the point. Indians Never had the choice. Common foe United us all and hence they all are national heroes. We have had a choice to choose the best after 1947. And hence I think 47 is a crucial junction from where the parameters for being a national heroe changed. Just my personal opinion tho. And that was more than what British gave us No. Neither am I expecting perfection nor my views are too idealistic. Expecting the basic common sense from this influential person seems to be so \"idealistic\" in your lens!! Thanks for agreeing that he could have been better person but he was not. I am not expecting everyone in an era to be same. But atleast a person who runs two daily newspapers in english and Marathi language must have a little common sense while talking about women. We cannot put the blame entirely on upbringing and environment. He was educated and he could have read the books and grown his thoughts but he didn't and kept narrow mindedness. \"Everyone has good and bad\" you said. In that case all terrorists, rapists, murderers etc must also be sympathised based on your logic. I do not care of the sacrifices he did, because women lost so many years of development because of men like him. Shame on him. Your last para of what if we were born in his era and what if he was born in our era is all again a repetition. He was well educated and had every capacity to support women but he chose not to. Hence if he was in this era too, his views would be regressive. Let me repeat, I am not judging him through MODERN LENS. I am comparing him with his fellow men of same era and saying he was not upto the mark. I agree with you. Had he encouraged women empowerment, they also would have contributed to India's independence and we would have achieved Swaraj still earlier. He is indirectly responsible for delayed freedom of India. Stopped reading after you'd prefer British rulers. Yes. Its important so that new generation know what these people actually were. I like his son more than him. Need to read more about Mr.Shridhar Tilak. Like I said in my other comments, I am not equating society of two different times. I compared his views on women with those of others from his own timeline. Bal Gangadhar Tate Yeah.. For getting rid of Britishers, we had to make people with zero common sense as our leaders . What a tragedy!! They were a product of their time just like you are in another 50 years meat eaters will be cancelled too and some phonyass guy like you will be cancelling everyone from our generation to feel a little better about himself. Rightly said. Yes he wasn't upto the mark as per our expectations but for the people of his era, he was their hero. Don't try to idolise him. ACKNOWLEDGE his efforts, need not respect his views on women. Look at historical figures in a dispassionate way.. Lol I keep saying that NO ONE IS PERFECT.. Are all educated people perfect? Come on tell me... Haven't you come across any educated person with regressive views in today's society..?? Then how can you expect in past society? Lol you are being idealistic without even realizing it. Also NO ONE IS SYMPATHIZING with law breakers.. NO ONE The one flaw that i find in your post and which made me comment is how you claim that he shouldn't be respected for his efforts on freedom struggle. You are basically tarnishing him entirely only for his views on women.. But then again you are a imperfect person just like me and Tilak.. Ben Shapiro (if youâre talk about the American conservative movement personality) is a specious, fame hungry turd waffle. Sorry I found myself compelled to comment about him Un...believable... Thanks for posting.. I am done with this legacy bullshit. If he dint respect women and Dalit, he is not respectable. Simple. Done. Some Britishers were also heroes to Indians. I hate it when people paint all of them as villains. A story that particularly touched me was that of a British woman named Sarah Tucker. She was a physically challenged woman who was confined to her room. But she heard about the backward and oppressive conditions in which Indian women lived in through her brother, who was an officer posted in India. She started a college for women in South India with her personal funds. Just imagine, when an Indian freedom fighter is so vehemently against women of his own country getting rights and education, a british woman who had never set foot in this country was giving away her wealth to uplift women thousands of miles away. The college is still running to this very day. Oh boy.. One man has delayed freedom struggle.. Gosh I m sorry I didn't live during that era to know that info.. The knowledge I have is based on history books that I have read and not wikipedia.. Lol you are going to be disappointed in humans throughout your life.. No one forced me? Ha ha.. I had text books in my school who pictured him as a great fellow. That's also kind of forcing wrong/incomplete information into our heads. Hence this post. Tragedy indeed Tragedy indeed 1857 people revolted to put Bahadur Shah Zafar, so they contributed to freedom struggle? Muslim League fought the British so contributed to freedom struggle? Antisemitic Azov fights Russians, they are contributing to Ucraine's freedom struggle? None of these cases the fight was for freedom for all, just a specific set of people either kings, men, supremacists etc. ITT: People reek of confirmation bias because they grew up believing something in a certain way. Some a-holes deserve to be canceled. And someone who called a young child who was possibly raped to death as a \"freak of nature with faulty female parts\" is definitely at the top of the list. He wasn't a God. We must, at all times, consider the fact that every person is a product of his time. People who were considered progressive hundred years ago would have some views that will be considered regressive today. Everyone from Gandhi to Thunberg to Rushdie have some views that are problematic. Take the good, ignore the bad. Don't hero worship. Yes. This one man was writing articles in two newspapers frequently and was an influencer at that time. Definitely he slowed down freedom struggle. Your text books are giving you only the half truths. Before we expect perfection from others, we must look at ourselves and think, \"are we perfect?\" Every leader in history has a good and a bad side. That's how humans are. No one is perfect. Noone said he was god. But he is acknowledged for good and his bad deeds are brushed under the carpet which is not acceptable. Do you eat non veg? There are animal activists today and its widespread knowledge that animals are tortured for meat. In the future if this becomes a big moral topic and miss treatment of animals becomes taboo, would it be right to condemn people of today and call them narrow minded? Every peace prize awardee in the last 20 years, except one, eats meat. Queen Victoria pardoned one of the girls and she went on to become one of India's first doctors. Yes if I had to choose between Balgand tilak and Victoria, I'll pick the latter. But thankfully we had other freedom fighters to truly look up to and not this hindu fundamentalist. There is clear distinction between being perfect and having common sense. I don't know why expecting a basic thing that Tilak must have considered women as equal to men is a \"too perfect\" idea? \"Never meet your heroes.\" First one must consider fellow human beings as human beings. After that we can slowly broaden the thinking to how to treat fellow living things/animals. Tilak didn't consider women as his equal. He failed in the first step itself. Now that is problematic. Quite ironic the girl that survived got pardoned by Queen Victoria and went on to become one of India's first real doctors. By that logic, nobody in this world is respectable. You're in for a rude awakening I am pretty sure the current leaders are doing something or the other which would be considered evil in another 100 years. Even you and I might be agreeing to that evil now. This is the same ideology BJP uses to blame stuff on Nehru, Aurangzeb etc. Yeah Shridhar was an MVP Fr tho.. I can't get why people can't see both the positive and negatives in a person.. No one should be harping about the good qualities in a person neither should they tarnish someone based on his views and thoughts..Lets just acknowledge both. Can't they see this whole situation from a birds eye.. Meaning as a spectator... Let's just talk about today 'influencial people's with regressive mindset and tackle them.. That's more important.. If we are going to cancel.. Then we all have to cancel everyone in this earth That is okay with me not to respect anyone if noone deserves it. I never thought history has heroes. Only stories do. History has people. That is why there are no heroes in reality. Are women really considered equal and given equal rights now? Most men are misogynistic one way or the other. It's the sad unfortunate truth. Then, although I don't agree with your opinion of these people, I respect it. It is consistent. I wish people had a more nuanced view of Western involvement in India. In China and Japan it's generally accepted that the white devils brought modernity to their society. Hell Indian national identity itself is a response to the British empire. Real heroes are people that never crave or care for recognition. I hope you find peace within yourself Wikipedia as History. Hmmm Even Bipin Chandra accepts and writes that Tilak being against consent bill and other reforms were because of it being introduced by British. He explicitly said that any reform should have its origin from within Hindu society. Were is Raja Ram Mohan Roy buried? Yes buried, because he was convert christian and search for yourself where he's buried. This was the reason he was abused and hated, consider that time Missionaries were one of the reason of many rebels including 1857 (I said one of the reasons) And why people are writing you should consider those time and not put 2023 parallel with it or even 21st century. Tell me what was the average age back then ? It was 25.4. You understand 25.4yrs old being average?? Or are you too dumb to comprehend? Now it is around 70. And let me tell you this, he was one of the prominent people because of whom violent and armed response was spread. He was conservative, no doubt but still he married his daughter at the age of 16, that was considered late and persuaded Hindus to adopt this age. Just because people have internet, can speak English they think they can spit their \"Intellectual facts\". Pathetic excuse to justify misogyny. There were many leaders in that time that fought for women's rights .. Watch European cinema (or evolved American cinema) for understanding how to appreciate nuanced portrayals of human personality. >would it be right to condemn people of today and call them narrow minded? Yes, because it's still bad and it will be bad even in the future. lol best of luck when you read wtf he said about Aryans and race. Okay dude, Ben Shapiro might be a lot. Tilak did effect social change in some positive ways. Yikes.This clearly shows that heros are not perfect and have feet of clay.They are human with flaws and thus not to be blindly idiolized or worshipped on a pedestal.He was a man of those times and probably very patriarchal and rigid in his views regarding women and their place in society. That being said, he did do a lot of good work as a leader for our freedom fight. We must learn to get off this blind hero worship bandwagon . Gandhiji had flaws and did some wierd things too but that does not lessen his contribution in bringing unity and power of the masses to win us freedom.All humans have flaws , more so our leaders .This is a fact we must learn to acknowledge. We should learn patriotism and and a sense of nationalism from them, like hitler was a maniac but he had a sense of nationalism which is admiring at first which turned into imperialism, dont preach the person preach the values for which they are respected. Some basic things can never be considered evil. One such thing is providing education to women. This can never be considered evil, no matter which era we be in. Hence what Tilak did was wrong. What is the use of such nationalism which is based on inequality? Dude nobody is perfect, even some are claiming mother Teresa was evil, they say Gandhi had pretty bad views on casteism, Let alone india, even George Washington owned slaves, but America celebrates him till this day. Absolutely yes, morality isn't absolute. We like to believe it is but it is what was acceptable at that time. Historical people are just people, they were subject to the same societal restrictions as we are. Saying women's rights are important is easy now because the society has accepted this. How many people are willing to stick their necks out for Gay marriage? or even Minority rights? Standing up for these causes means going against society which very few people can do. Why is mother Teresa called evil? Tilak might have come with the logic that first let's consider all men as equal and deserve freedom because even indian men did not have freedom. He could have said like you have, first let's consider men as equals, slowly we can broaden the thinking to women. You do 100 good things people wonât bother, you do one wrong thing, people will curse you for lifetime. You didn't get my point Search in google bro, there's a lot of articles and videos on that... He was from a time where his views were the norm. Sure it is bad according to today's standards but it was acceptable then. His accomplishments for Indian independence are not undermined by his societal views, especially if they were simply the norm of the time. If a grown adult thinks in terms of black and white then you are simply an idiot Never argued he was not wrong. He was absolutely wrong. He called stuff to Raja Rammohan Roy for getting rid of Sati in Bengal. He called stuff to Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar for supporting Widow Remarriage. Tilak did a lot of wrong things. But if we start blaming every historical figure for their mistakes or character flaws then there is a problem. Should the misogynistic part of Tilak be taught in school? Absolutely. I was taught about it in school. Not sure what is happening in schools now a days that people are so oblivious about our own history. No he didn't. He even opposed bill for abolishing untouchability. He didn't consider fellow men as equals. There is a saying, even if you are unable to do any good, it's okay, but don't do harm. He did harm to women of India and that's bad. Hi idiot.. please read other comments before you repeat same thing here. It was not taught in cbse some years back. If it's being taught, then great. In Kolkata, ICSE board, we were taught about it in class 6 or 7. It was in the history text book followed by my school. Bro's source is wikipedia ð Good to know. Some relief to my soul today by hearing this. That's okay How many supported it? a very handful of them! This is not the case just in India but also in West as well. If you wore a skirt that lets the knees visible you were considered a whore in many parts of Europe as early a 1930s. And most of the leaders were like that not just Tilak. S Radhakrishnan was a womaniser, Gandhi was a pedo, that doesn't change what they did for the country but definitely they are a\\*\\*holes by current standards and fine by standards of that time. Doesn't matter if he was an a**hole towards women, he still helped in independence. He was an extraordinary freedom fighter and that's a fact. My question is why Tilak didnt fall into the category of handful who supported women in his time. He had access to books, education and knowledge. But he didn't use it well. Thik hai bhai ð Fact is that a guy who did not treat his fellow men and women as equal, never fought for nation. He did it for men like him. Superbly articulated! Lots of people have trouble analysing different traits of people on their own merit and tend to consider the whole âpackageâ, which is never the case. People get emotionally involved with the people they are loving/hating and tend to focus only on those aspects of their personality which fits their world view. Yeah dumbass I did read the other comments. If you think like a 6 year old, applying the current moral standards to someone in the past then you are the problem. Every historical figure had their own vices and shortcomings. Probably 100 years from now people might view people promoting killing animals in the same light. So ignore their shortcomings and learn from their actions What world do you live in where everyone is a misogynist and casteist? If they are, they can go fuck themselves. Everyone has some form of belief system that I don't agree with. I am an anti-theist. My parents are staunch Hindus I support LGBTQ+ to some extent. My boss at work makes fun of them. I don't support the consideration of gender in sports (only sex). Most LGBTQ+ activists would disagree with my stance. I stand for gender equality while most people at my workplace look down upon women...even coworkers. I don't hate everyone I come across. Some people, who take their beliefs to the level of intolerance (e.g., coworkers who discriminate based on gender) don't deserve my respect. Rest can go on with their lives without any issues with me as long as they keep to themselves and don't interfere with other people. Because all historical figures have flaws, that does not take away he was one who contributed to the independence of India. Everyone is a product of their time it was the 1800s. Women rights werent that big then. It was nomral back then. Judging someone in the past by the morals of today doesn\\`t work How benevolent of the Queen to pardon one of the Indian girls while simultaneously ruling over a country, looting their wealth, destroying their industries and making them join wars on behalf of the British Empire. Tu Kam hi bola kar Bhai/behan No shithead , you haven't read the other comments. it's not current moral standards. People had supported for women education in his own timeline. You are the problem who comments the same thing again even if answer is there in other comments. Disrespect to women cannot be ignored. He was responsible for the delay in women empowerment and indirectly delay in India's independence. Even if women's rights were not big, he could have supported people who were emerging with school for women instead of opposing it. He justifies the death of a 11 year old girl during sexual intercourse. What a sick mindset. And how did he delay independence? It was not an overnight thing And secondly, as I said, he was a product of his time just like you and I will be products of ours You do know the shit Gandhi got upto right? He delayed independence by not allowing women their basic right to education. Else all women who are educated would have fast paced the process. By your logic of \"product of time\" , all criminals can be given clean chit for doing some good things parallelly. I think Gandhi deserve a separate dedicated post!! There are pedophilia allegations against Gandhiji. Netaji sided with the Nazis in WW2. Do you think no innocent was ever killed by the militant freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh? Thing is, if you look at people's lives, you will find some shit. Gandhiji being a racist has little to do with the idea of non-violence. Netaji still is our hero. These people had an impact on the society of their time, and are the reason we are free. I agree, we should not idolize and whitewash these people, but acknowledging their contributions is necessary. That would be akin to being done with all that is good in life. This will lead to nothing except misery. Life has countless shades. Let us call out Gandhi and Subash Chandra Bose too. Both were bad. That assumes that respect requires perfection, which is an unjustifiable claim. People don't have complete knowledge, and those who are judging others themselves have many flaws. If someone manages to transcend their limitations and do the right thing (even if not entirely), they do deserve respect for it. I am okay with misery. Let me not respect people who don't deserve it. I think we do call them out. We have to realize, no one in history was an absolute good person. We still need to learn from them. Lmao getting Information from wikipedia rather than reading books No. People need not be perfect to be respected. All I ask for is to treat fellow humans as humans first. If Tilak has failed to do so, then no respect for him. It is like , I am expecting minimum passing marks of 35 and everyone here is saying that I am expecting Marks to be 100 out of 100. There is difference in understanding of my expectations and the way it is being assumed by readers. I am worried because, if Tilak dint understand the value of women in life, then what values he might have in his life? No need of learning anything from a man who didn't treat fellow humans equally. Information present in Wikipedia did not come from void. Nobody can be \"okay\" with it. If one thinks so, it is likely a result of their belief that being okay would bring them some kind of satisfaction (which is the opposite of misery). People always deserve respect for the good they have done. Some of Mahatma Gandhi's strange actions (by the way, there is no evidence of any inappropriate contact) don't change the fact that there are not many people who can go to a riot-hit area (unarmed) for the sake of stopping violence when they could be busy celebrating the independence day (Sardar Patel mentions this in his 1948 address to the nation). Your frustration and fury are far from unreasonable, my friend. However, within that whirlpool, there is an underlying respect/need for precisely the same goods that I don't want us to carelessly discard (working for the upliftment of others, being able to stand up to oppression, etc.). Actions are not entirely divorced from individuals, and when we fail to acknowledge a positive, we are ultimately devaluing the good itself. Your expectations are indeed unrealistic. Even if there was respect for Dalits and Women, one could move towards animal exploitation and focus on how hypocritical many activists are. The issue is that progress is an ongoing process. When judging others, their intentions, their environment, and the good they did also have to be kept in our minds. Considering how conservative many people are today, it is not difficult to imagine what the prevailing mindset was a hundred years ago. 35 marks are still much higher than 0. You articulated it really well! Especially the last line.. ð If there is no evidence of inappropriate contact, that's not enough. The filthy act itself is unacceptable. We don't want mahatma's not valuing women boundaries and then preaching peace to country. It's okay if these people did not do any good. But the wrong doing is unacceptable. Their narrow mindedness is more vicious and dangerous than their contribution to freedom. Lokmanya Tilak. That's what we were taught to call him. That's what he is regarded as meanwhile he was the castiest, misogynist who wouldn't have moved a muscle to make the world a better place if the British hadn't touched the topic of castism and women's state in the country. The British will always be colonizing, racist and hateful jerks but being treated like filth by people of our own country hurts more. No. My expectations are minimal and very realistic. Progress is an ongoing process. I agree. But people like Tilak are hindrances to the real progress. If expecting 35 is high expectation hundred years ago, even when people of same era were scoring 60+, then you have to rethink on what you commented. Ooohhhh you don't wanna go there firse demonetization karwana padega, Context: Gandhi wrote on how brown people and white people are of same superiority and black people are inferior to them, among other controversial things. Yes now Ambani Tata and Adani loots our wealth, destroys competing industries and wages surgical strike for elections. Hey at least it is our brown peepul taking our tax money, all good. I agree That's why Arundhati Roy called him correctly as a politician and not Mahatma His âdelayâ is just your bias and conjecture lmao You can't deny the fact that for a time, he was the face of India against the British. It's history. Agree with you that we tend to see them with rose tainted glasses, but even then, his contribution should be acknowledged. The French Revolution sought to establish a republic, only for land owning men in France. Not for peasants, not for women, not for subjects in colonies like Pondicherri, and definitely not for slaves. But they were the first to establish terms like \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\", which became vital inspiration for later movements for human rights, including the Indian freedom struggle. People like Gandhi and Tilak stand for our freedom struggle. We should acknowledge them and get inspiration from them, while also acknowledging their flaws and striving to be better than them. People can also edit random things..ð¤£ð¤£ He strived for independence of UC Hindu men, not for everyone. By your logic Muslim league also strived for independence by going after the British. Or the 1857 revolters wanting to put Bahadur Shah Zafar back to the throne. Same way people can also write anything in books. I agree that his views were problematic, but we also have to remember that \"everyone\" was not starting the Swadeshi movement and risking imprisonment and death for the freedom of their nation. If this was the case, freedom would have arrived sooner. Hindrances are negative ideas, not people as a whole. A racist Dalit feminist could simultaneously be a boon for some communities and a hindrance for others. I think that we need to rethink the all or nothing mindset that permeates our minds these days. They were humans of their time. Their bad doesnt supersede their bad and their bad doesnt supersede their bad. Simple. All the haters just parrots a single Hitchen's article. I bet most of them don't even know who he is. Not saying Hitchen is wrong, but basing from a single source is. Hope you know Ambedkar's views on muslims too. Gandhi's view on women are also interesting. Everything has two sides lmao. This is the problem. We disliked British and for that sole reason why should we accept people who do not deserve any respect as leaders? We must hate both ideally. Yes so misogynistic that majority of men decided to give favourable divorce rights to women instead of men . Same like you are biased to believe that these people actually did good. Lol. Open your eyes atleast now. Wake up. It's not that I don't understand the phrase. It's just that I am typing short replies as I have to type same thing repeatedly for comments like yours. What Tilak wanted to achieve by swadeshi movement without treating fellow humans as humans in first place? He was hindrance to equality. It's sad that to acknowledge Tilak's good deeds ( which I don't think are good as compared to the bad deeds of his) , imaginary depth is being created to depict the minimal as a high standard!! Thats why i read books by good authors unlike you My bad i was expecting logic from a bong Hating the British has little to do with it. These are the people who created the idea of India as we know it, and established our nation. Gandhiji may have been racist, but is there no value in the idea of non-violence? Time to call out everyone!! Again good author to you might be one who whitewashes the criminal acts of these leaders. Perspective differs. My bad , I was also expecting that you would realise truth. His problem wasn't that he wanted freedom; it was that he did not cover all areas and go far enough. Nevertheless, he still fought for the liberation of a plethora of people who doubtlessly would have suffered a terrible fate. This is not nothing (especially when we think about the fact that one could have easily spent their life working for the government). The world we inhabit still contains people who would be fine with enslaving an entire race of people (no gender or social group being exempted) for centuries. The depth is very much real. In my view, once we take into account factors such as one's upbringing, ignorance, and the courage required to leap into an uncertain freedom struggle, the good does overtake the bad. If it's not right to classify people into good and bad, then it's not right to classify their deeds as well. If we go by that logic, there won't be necessity of courts, laws and jails/prisons. We wuz from the North Pole and shizz. ð He fought for liberation you said. Liberation of who? Liberation of men like him to continue exploiting dalit and women? Then his whole fight against British is meaningless. I did consider his upbringing, ignorance etc. He should have seen the suffering of fellow men and should have thought or taken steps to abolish untouchability which he dint do. He had access to books and library which he did not make use to gain open mindedness. What he has done to our society is clear to me now. He made us feel that in his timeline, expecting him to treat fellow humans as humans itself is high expectation!! You are right. Check his views on lower caste people too. There is a reason many people in Maharashtra calls him Bhatmanya instead of Lokmanya. I don't get your point. Why is classifying deeds wrong? People should ideally be awarded for their good deeds and punished for their wrong. What's so hard to understand about that? I pointed out the follies in people like Gandhiji, and said that these need to be talked about. People should hate their bad deeds and praise the good ones. If you don't mind, how old are you OP? You said classifying people as good and bad is wrong. Hence I said people and their deeds are inseparable. If classifying people is wrong, then classifying their deeds also becomes wrong. If a murderer donates his kidney but kills a man, it is not justified. Same way, hindering women empowerment and oppressing dalit and doing freedom fight does not mean anything. That would presume that oppression is all men did. The fact (and the tragedy) of evil is its deceptive nature. For many, it becomes something natural that cannot be/doesn't have to be changed. Humans once blindly attacked each other for food and believed that subjugating a nation was a moral good. To go from that to believing in the right of each nation to exist independently is no mean feat. It isn't \"meaningless\" to help fellow human beings who, despite their flaws, are still capable of having meaningful bonds and experiencing love. When your mind is occupied with when the police will come knocking at your door and when your next protest is going to be, you do not get much time to read. Again, I agree that he should have done better. All I am pointing out that there are multiple elements involved that cannot be ignored. Basic decency is an ever-changing idea. Once upon a time, it would have been enough to not brutally attack others. Then, it became more sophisticated and turned into a need for actively helping those around us. Finally, ethics gained an international nature that went beyond narrow walls. In each scenario, there was some good and some bad (though, objectively speaking, the latter was probably higher). But we have to separate the consequences from the character of the men and women we are discussing. While the former is an undeniable truth, the latter is a complex reality that incorporates the limits of knowledge, intentions, biases, etc. >it is not justified Agree. That's why we should reward the murderer for donating his kidney and then hang him. I would also recommend the following articles regarding Mahatma Gandhi: I agree with the progress human race has made collectively since the origin of mankind. But let us not broaden the scope of this discussion to that extent. In second para, you have told that when mind is occupied with thoughts like when police will come knocking at door, there is not enough time to think and read. But remember , Tilak was running two weekly magazines. He was having time. He dint utilize it well in the right direction. Moreover, you need not read books to see what women and dalit were undergoing. It's enough if you have compassion in heart which he clearly lacked. Finally we cannot separate the consequences from the character of men and women we are discussing. It is their deed that resulted in consequences. Their deed was result of their thought process which was corrupt. How much ever their environment contributed, still Tilak had lot of chances to be better. But he failed. people are people. Didn't know Ambani and Adani were also causing man made famines and millions dying because of them, and also allowing shit like jalianwallah bagh massacre to happen, I truly hope for your sake that you're a kid who doesn't understand shit right now, if you're over 20... Then like I said, come bola kar Bhai Hope you take it positively and not like a usual chaddi saying it's propaganda and stuff. If he was a product of his time, he was in no way revolutionary. Mahatma Phule, Ambedkar...these were revolutionaries and are commemorated worldwide. Tilak wanted freedom. There's no doubt. But he wanted it only for half the India. Basically he wanted to replace the British rule with Brahmanical rule. Call me whatever u want, this was the essence of \"Hinduism\" under the Peshwai In that case, there are high chances that he be considered hero among next generation kids. They also will think that they can commit any crime and balance it with good deeds. This is problematic. Nobody is a perfect role model, all our \"current role modes\" we only see their good sides. He may be a bad person but we cannot discredit all his accomplishments that contributed to the development of our country. The test was of 10 marks in the past. Right now its 100 marks. The person who got 10/10 in the ancient times got 10/100 today (or less, because the grading numbers might have changed). Yet the same person set about some legacy. In the future, the grading will be of 1000 marks, and even if you strive to be a 100 right now, and people are thirsting for your respect points, you will be 100/1000 for a similar person like you in the future sad I have read these. As said in other comments , lets take on Gandhi in a separate post. Compared to his bad deeds, his contributions seem insignificant. I think if we do not broaden the scope, we will reach misguided conclusions, such as believing that one can truly be willing to work for the freedom of others without having compassion. Also, sometimes people can deliberately suppress their own feelings if they go against their biases. And your statement answers your own question. If one is busy organising people, managing massive events, and also writing books, there isn't much time left. A more holistic person would have seen that women and Dalits also needed attention, but this doesn't mean that good wasn't done. I agree that on the matter of women empowerment and Dalit empowerment, he ultimately failed. However, the reason I will continue to emphasise the need to separate consequences and character is because the latter does not always accurately demonstrate a person's morality. A simple example would be a drunk driver hitting someone vs. someone intentionally doing so despite not being influenced by any substance. It would be short-sighted to think that one's motives make the consequences pointless, but I think that it would be equally bad to solely focus on the results. If we did so, we would make an extremely punishing society that would needlessly deprecate good actions as people would often doubt all of their actions and wonder if there was much point in acting at all (as they could still be missing something). Yeah good manipulation. Expecting a human to treat fellow human properly is a big expectation in 1800s it seems. Very good explanation. When we have people in 12 th century fighting against dalit and women oppression, you are saying that it was high expectation in 19th century. Nice. If I may, who are you for? What are you for? >biased to believe that these people actually did good Striving for independence in any way, no matter one's flaws, is an objective good and considering the example you gave, leads me to believe you do not Again you don't have to idolise him, but u can't ignore all the things he's done, I'm saying this in general not against or for a particular person. All bad deeds committed must not neutralise the good deeds, we must know both and then decide. I don't think that we need an extensive discussion on this topic. The article covers the most controversial aspect. This one is about the rest: The central point remains that this does not change the fact that taking a bullet for ahimsa is unlikely to be accomplished by many. Men usually inspire others to end their lives by enticing them with violence towards others. Few are able to do so for the greater good of the fellow man. >By your logic Muslim league also strived for independence by going after the British. Or the 1857 revolters wanting to put Bahadur Shah Zafar back to the throne. Never said he was the only one striving for independence, nor was he the first to do so. Yeah and that was a minority of the population arguing for women's rights. You not understanding history is your own problem. He was human, he had his mistakes like everyone else, he was one of the founders of the swaraj movement. Tbh i believe Sri Aurobindo Rai should be considered as the starter of the movement neither Gandhi or tilak No. You have the right to criticize all of their qualities individually. But disregarding everything, due to a set of bad qualities a grey historical figure is hasty. Its better to be more nuanced. Also: Should we consider Tilak as a hero? No. Should we study him as a historical figure, who participated in the Independence movement? Yes. Does he deserve a thank you note? Probably. Does he deserve to be called out? Yes. >there are high chances that he be considered hero among next generation Bingo! When we tell them about the man, we tell them that he donated a kidney, and that he murdered someone. We tell them that we gave him Rs. 1 crore for the donation, and hanged him for the murder. We teach them that donating your kidney is the right thing to do, murder is not. Two deeds do not cancel each other and the person does not get erased from history. We should learn that our heroes are not worthy of blind worshipping, and which qualities of theirs need to be emulated, and which are not. Expecting heroes to be unquestionable forces of good is childish. Just waiting for the time till you hear about the women's view Gandhi had. I disagree that broadening the scope to the timeline of evolution of entire mankind would help us in not being misguided. Yes. People without compassion can fight for freedom. Their perspective of freedom is different. For example Tilak. He wanted to be free from British but denied the same freedom to women and dalit. So where is the compassion you are talking about? It's not there. Thanks for accepting that he had to do better. However the example of a driver who is drunk and hitting someone and a person deliberately doing it , both are punishable. The guy knows that drinking may kill someone and still would do it. So he doesn't care and is as guilty as person who does it on purpose. If Tilak supported women and dalit empowerment, I would have appreciated him even if he was not able to contribute much to Indian independence movement. I am also not focusing on result here. I am focusing on the corrupt thought process of his. I am just a person calling out the false leaders. Independence at the cost of women and dalit oppression is unacceptable. Good deeds are insignificant compared to his thoughts on women and dalits. Bal Gangadhar Tilak is considered a national hero from the Independence struggle point of view. He is not a women's right activist. We cannot judge someone who grew up in late 1800s with the ideals of today. There were other people like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Jyotiba Phule etc. who campaigned for women's rights. But it's possible that if you dig deep enough you might find something about them that is not acceptable today. Subash Chandra Bose is also respected as a great freedom fighter, but he tried to form a Nazi alliance. It just goes to show that no one is perfect and that we cannot idolize anyone, especially not a historical figure. As said let's talk about Tilak here and Gandhi would be on another thread . This link can be used there. I don't see any problem with minority population asking the right things. Tilak must have supported them. You misunderstanding history is your problem. Yeah, he had unforgivable mistake. The same reason people are still racist, casteist, misogynsts and etc. they choose to be that way. Recognize and move on! We should be more worried about the current leaders than past. The compassion is not absent; it is limited. This is why extending the scope is vital. Without a background, we simply don't know what is enough and what is too little. If you risked your life and gave up your earnings to save my family, it would be foolish of me to say that you are cruel or cold because, for some reason, you chose not to save me. Could one argue that more could have been done? Of course. But what remains is distinct from what survives. I never denied that he did not. I already acknowledged that the harm done in both cases cannot be ignored, but I think that most people would agree that there is something uniquely evil about a person consciously sitting in the driver's seat and meticulously planning how they would end a person's life. This is not the same as a man, who was perhaps saddened by his family's circumstances, carelessly drinking and then driving. The difference lies in the degree of carelessness. Life is complex and diversity cannot be underestimated. I would say that independence is of utmost importance. Colonialism did not merely strip people of economic resources, but also any fundamental sense of belonging to one's land. At the deepest level, the national spirit is eroded completely. When this happens, even if there are temporary gains, everyone loses in the long term. To think that women don't deserve freedom from patriarchy is surely corrupt, but to think that countless men and women must attain liberation from a foreign power is, in all honesty, quite moral. I don't think he deserves a thank you note with this corrupt thought process. Did deep enough, Nobody's clean. Bhai (almost) all the prominent history figures from Gandhi, mother Teresa to Savarkar were not perfect and thats normal because they were humans after all. What they were was freedom fighters and not gods and should not be identified as such. I can say the same thing about animals, killing animals cannot be ignored. Jallianwallah bagh - 3000casualities 2002 riots- 5000 Babri- 10000+ Sikh riots 15000+ Lets ignore Maharashtra, WB, Orissa, Bihar getting worse drought post independence *twice each of them* while north India hesitated aid while enjoying surplus in all those instances. Things suuure changed. Count doesn't matter, but funny you all are in a delusion that rest of India wants to ruled by Gujju northie corporo fasci colonialists. Your extent of knowledge on history seems to be till class X. You should instead focus on Bolly gossips that you normally partake in. Stick to your lane. And if the next generation wants their name in history they end up following the same footsteps. This must be stopped. It's okay if you are not able to donate kidney, but never murder. This must be taught. I don't believe that a separate thread is required. I was simply making a general claim about the need to see the people as more than some parts. I know about it. Gandhi deserve separate post. Thats not my point though. How do you define independence? If Bahadur Shah Zafar came back to throne would you call yourself independent? Muslim League fought against british but not for independence of all India. It just so happens ML and our fight was against a common enemy but not have a common objective. That is my point, Tilak only wanted autonomy for UC Hindu Men and non-interference in manusmriti rules like women should be mandatorily married by 8yo. Tilak wanted Hindu Rashtra essentially and while he fought against British his objectives were different, just like ML. Also i heard from a friend that ganpati visarjan was brought about because untouchables would touch the idol during Chathurthi. This system was brought about by BGT That's a good sentiment. I once asked a Bangladeshi why they don't celebrate 14/15th august. The person said post 1947 only the rulers changed, but the rulers were still aliens. Thats the state India is today, one small set of foreigner states, specifically their rulers, priests and corporates imposing their culture on the rest while they loot and monopolize business, religion, language, way of life among other things. Agree completely The following articles provide an intriguing perspective: Thank you. I do respect OP's genuine apprehensions about not underplaying the troubling facets of an individual. At the same time, the sheer variety of life compels one to prefer a balanced analysis. Since everytime this is posted, replies are always confirmation copium. I'll repost two meaningful comments from an old [post with primary source](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/nqoqbl/til_of_rukhmabai_and_phulamanibai_cases_where_two/?sort=top): First: >It's not by today's standards. Back then there were movements, arguments against this bullshit. He chose not to get into them because he's not the one getting raped to death. 2. One incident isn't fair? So if a rapist just rapes once, he should not be judged for that? 3. It's not just a ridiculous statement he made in private, though even that would be bad. It's a national case where a ten years old child was raped to death and he defended that. He in fact, took a public position where government couldn't prevent such situations. He opposed the law to increase age of consent. I'm just confused and horrified that how many times have you blamed a dead rape girl that you feel like this is a silly statement? 4. And 13-14 and ten years old, there's a lot of difference between these years. It seems just three four, but most girls at least enter puberty by the age of 13, so while it's not perfect, 13-14 sounds much better. Holy fucking hell women are worse than animals and it's no wonder why. Defense of fucking kids is seen as something 'silly'. BTW is there anything this country won't forgive if it's done by an upper caste man? Also again, there were several people who pointed out just how shitty girls marriage was, people like him chose to ignore that. Dude you're forgetting that periyar, ambedkar, phule were ancient too. 2nd: >Are you sure its not confirmation bias from school history. There's a difference between following some societal rules silently, and being vehemently against change, openly supporting oppressors. Bal was pretty right wing conservative in that regard. And if you see today's majority thought and rural society in India, it hasn't much change. Will we excuse Savarkar, Modi and Yogi too since their upbringing was similar to that era. >Rukhmabai got pardoned by Empress Victoria herself and went on to become one of India's first women doctors. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a century before Bal Gangadhar. Don't say there was no humanism/feminism in that era. While these people were fighting for feminism and change, Bal was vocally anti. >Also 13 and 11 are far apart. 11 is literally pre-pubescent and no child has any reason to get married at that phase. By that logic, keep going young and marrying a 3yr old would be okay. The thank you note is not for his evil deeds. We need to separate them. I am shocked at the level of ignorance and stupid answer used as justification for anger tilak and Gandhi were both born roughly 100 yrs after colonial rule started and 400 yrs post Mughal invasion, to have Hindus treated as a lower class then the creation of caste system, it is easy to be an idiot in an air conditioned brick room and write against a man considered a leader and hero, he lived and died while fighting for country I wanna know...... Not that I disagree with you but I've heard that Bose wasn't aware of how Japanese were actually treating Indian POWs Of course despite his alignment with the Nazis-Japanese still leaves a bad taste in my mouth because while many of the terrible details might have been not that well known,their ideology was still out in the open which was reprehensible on its own even without knowledge of the actions taken >There are numerous other commendable legends who deserves the spotlight All of whom had their shortcomings, Gandhi was casteist and racist; Sardar Patel was Islamophobic, Indira Gandhi was the OG modi, even Ambedkar was Islamophobic, ..... Can't use 21st century values on 20th century men Life isnât just about divorce or alimony right? Ratio of divorce where women gets huge alimony vs other crimes against women? Itâs no match. Youâre watching too much instagram. Memers are posting for engagement, belittling women and men think thatâs reality of life. The times they lived I guess.. In future if killing animals for food is considered inhumane, how would they judge us? Would ask if the books ever written be burnt and national history dis-owned? And you're equating better treatment of women and dalit people to animals? Congress has tarnished a lot of people, incl. Savarkar and Hedgewar. > nationalism BS He was not against women ,his point was whatever change needed must be made by Indians only ,as independent country ,the non violent guys then had policy of protesting against everything British protested to frustrate them and show how useless British system then was . Not everyone can change their perspective on things. Even if it is wrong. Was tilak in the wrong on this? Yes he was. But that doesn't take away from any other achievements he had for the freedom struggle, nor does it matter what his views on women's rights was. He is studied and respected for his role in the freedom struggle, not women's rights and textbooks focusing on the former only is a non issue for the same reason. And the same applies to any historical figure. They are all from a different era and had different views and beliefs and so the only thing that matters is their accomplishments. Contrasting their views with modern ones is simply a waste of time, especially for a minor footnote like tilak You do realize why it was needed to give favorable divorce rights to women? It's because the patriarchical system didn't ever allow women to get financial independence. For example, a boy's education was always prioritized over a girl's in any non-affluent household. A girl is infact killed on birth because people don't want girls. If not for laws, women's lives would be way, way worse. Same with Savarkar. Dude was a straight up Nazi, who consistently supported Germany's treatment of the Jews. He went one step further in wanting to emulate that in India with respect to Jews. He was also misogynistic, and felt that women belong in kitchens' and in child care. Unlike Tilak he supported educating women, but only so far as to make them better at running the household and being better mothers who raise patriotic children. Many people were aware of that treatment. Bose being deep in it must have known at least more than normal people. The only thing he might have been unaware of maybe was the cannabalism of Indian troops by Japanese. But my concern is not that. Mine is, did Bose really think that after liberation from British the Japs would just leave us and go back? We would have end up with something worse than British Raj. That is BS. I have had it with giving people a pass for absolutely abhorrent views because \"it was the times\" Fuck that. These are people who are remembered as extraordinary people, we expect them to be better than the lowest common denominator. This good for India's independence but not a good social reformer view is too forgiving. A better way to look at it is that he was a POS who did *some* good shit for India's independence. Even a broken clock is correct twice a day... and all that. I am not judging him by ideals of today but by the ideals of 1800s. Again, its not matter of time. When Raja Ram Mohan Roy could support women empowerment why couldn't Tilak do? Subash Chandra Bose also must be condemned. I know that noone is perfect. But Tilak disappoints by not having basic human quality of compassion. I am reminded of Drinkwater Bethune, who founded Bethune College in Kolkata, which also like Sarah Tucker College is running to this day. > Gandhi was a pedo, This was dickish behavior even by then standards. He lost several of his close followers because of his pedo behavior. What Gandhi did for India is certainly debatable - what with truth and propaganda of over 70 years getting muddled - beyond being a rather shrewd statesman. Current leaders learn from past. Hence calling out these leaders and their big mistakes from past will ensure that current leaders will be alerted and know what not to repeat. Itâs so disappointing and disheartening to learn that this horrific side of him will never be in curriculum in schools because we idolise such people and refuse to look at or even believe any bad done by them. Only infuriates me further to think how many more such faces would have been taught to us as heroes but are actually regressive assholes To me, this is just a way of shifting blame from them and not holding them accountable for THEIR own beliefs and actions. Itâs not a simple trait as âoh he didnât like ice creamâ; he literally didnât want a whole GENDER to progress. He wanted the caste system to prevail. You canât possibly have respect for someone after that? If they held a position of power doesnât that just make it so much more their responsibility to act the part? and here we are, still conveniently turning a blind eye to the horrendous beliefs they had. He did use it to right some BS Indian wankfest books about how the Vedas originated in the Arctic and some other shit about Orion and? i would rather not HAVE to respect someone i have 0 respect for (given they literally supported the caste system and untouchability and wanted a whole gender to stay oppressed) It is he was a freedom fighter and he has given contribution you should not disrespect anyone who has done their part in India's freedom Tilak was born in 1850s not 1950s. iâm sorry but if we go by what youâre saying, if say a person commits rape, we should start looking at all their achievements and good theyâve done first and then judge them as a person? hell no, you throw the damn pest in prison. It isnât a simple difference of opinion on ice cream flavour. The man wanted a whole gender to remain oppressed. He had no respect for women whatsoever. He wanted the caste system and untouchability to prevail. Iâm sorry but if you can look past that and think of the âgoodâ a person is done, hats off, the worldâs gonna make a major ass out of you. Hitler did some great things in his time, but we all know of the atrocities. Am i to believe that youâd want to sit and have a cup of tea with him to discuss all the good heâs done? Limited compassion not even enough to treat women and Dalit as humans is unacceptable. Going by your example, if I risked my life and earnings to save your family and then become hindrance to empowerment of women in your family or hindrance for empowerment of your kids if they are dalits, then there is no meaning of saving them in first place. In the example of a person dringking and driving, he is so careless that he thinks only of himself and risks everyones life on road. The one who plans kills a specific one. But the one who drinks kills many. Both are bad. This example itself is not fitting in. Independence struggle is overrated. Before British came in, already society was divided based on caste. Hence it became easy for them to conquer. All these people like Tilak wanted British to go away so that they can continue the oppression. What is the benefit to oppressed community by such independence movement? Its not about who is clean. Its about who has spilt the filth more. Ambedkar's views on STs are also very problematic. Does that mean he is also cancelled?? ð¤ I am talking specifically about Tilak here. In my opinion he must not be considered a freedom fighter but a bully who wanted to oppress Dalits and women. First atleast Tilak must have taken first step which is considering women and Dalits as humans which he failed to do. We will come to animals as a second step. I mean here context with Tilak is horrible views not horrible deeds. (Both very different). Right? OP doesn't seem to get that nuance. Wow, seems you are an idealist. No one is perfect! Take the good from people and be better. Trying to find a âgoodâ person isnât the lesson you should learn from history, history isnât for that purpose. Can't. Specially when a person did not treat another person as equal to him. Yeah same.. I can understand OP's frustration on why such people are celebrated but I commented because I felt we should have an unbiasedview at the topic. Don't know. But as I have heard, Ganapathi pandals were used to meet and unite people for next activities wrt freedom struggle. No one is turning a blind eye on their horrendous ways or behaviour.. If you read the comments below, not one person is actually supporting his views on women.. What most of us here are trying to imply is to look at the whole issue in an unbiased manner and acknowledge that everything in life is grey.. Neither white not black. you donât need to support his views to support him. If you think after all heâs done iâm still going to look at it in an unbiased (????) manner, youâre mistaken. I have no respect for anyone who believes that he should be looked at from some rose lenses. Iâm a lawyer sir, so although i understand life can be grey, situations like these make me thankful that i can see everything as black and white. Thanks for posting it here. They tarnished themselves. Savarkar joined league with his 'stick to office' in provincial elections and overt support to British. Hedgewar, Moonje etc. were assholes of the highest order hoisting saffron against tricolor as early as Poorna Swaraj declaration. Hedgewar is the reason we have the literal shit Golwaker and his copied nazi ideology out there for preaching. Tilk was a weird guy, the militant Hindu nationalism can be traced to him. One of the many weird convictions he had was Aryans came from Artic to India :) Golwalker took it along with his nazi ideals and claimed North pole was located in India! Dr.Ambedkar was right about Islam.He was not Islamophobic.He pointed out the flaws in all religions.While Gandhi changed his racist ways in later days.He discussed about it in his books.But imo he did not recognize caste as a big evil,which was one of his failings but not evil.Indira Gandhi was a dictator ,she should not be admired. But none of them is comparable to Tilak,who outright told women and Dalit do not deserve education.The idea of India consist of these communities treated equally.The above ones believed in it but Tilak did not. Tilak lived and died oppressing women and Dalits. He is no leader. okay...can you please name 5 figures who you consider as freedom fighters Do you have source perhaps? In Pune, at least when I grew up, Tilak was revered like anything and we never really bothered to read up on negatives. Thanks to internet, we learn that people we idolized had feet of clay in some respects after all. Our heroes are also human and have biases pertinent to the era they lived through. Learn what is there to learn from them and leave out the rest. This is exactly why it is limited. I would say that you risking your life to save lives has inherent value. Slavery is worse than freedom, but it isn't necessarily worse than living at all. This is why people persevered despite odds. Also, in my example, I was talking about myself. In my example, the number of people harmed is the same. What changes is not the consequence, but the background. I think that we simply cannot focus exclusively on the consequences. To do so would be missing a crucial element of what makes us human. Blood and tears are never overrated. One evil doesn't justify another. I don't think that there is sufficient evidence to say that the primary reason why Mr Tilak was advocating for independence was to oppress someone. In fact, the easiest way to do so would have been to try to convince the British how useful it would be if the Indian elite and the Brahmins delayed independence for the sake of controlling a large number of people. After 1857, the British government would have quite glad for such a suggestion. The constitution that was shaped by Dr Ambedkar and other leaders at least strengthened the consciousness of liberation. The development of this constitution would not have occurred if the government had not been forced to consider giving independence and representation due to sustained pressure. >I have no respect for anyone who believes that he should be looked at from some rose lenses. Did anyone comment here that he shouldn't be insulted as he is a freedom fighter? Nope. All people are trying to express (majority of them) is there are facets to human behaviour and nature. Putting a man on a scale for one of his many views or thoughts in his life is ridiculous.. > Iâm a lawyer sir, so although i understand life can be grey, situations like these make me thankful that i can see everything as black and white. Then as a lawyer you should understand this better lol. Nothing in law is black and white itself... Not always anyways.. I haven't really read any books on the subject so what you're saying could be true unfortunately. Yeah,I think so too,he was seriously underestimating just how imperialist and cruel the Japanese were.More cruel than the Brits who atleast tried to keep up the pretense of moral uprightness and following law,the Japanese were far crueler and more open about it,reading about comfort women and unit 731 is so horrifying It is not the times they lived. People who lived 100 years before them had spoken against caste discrimination. Its his own corrupt mindset. Must. And that article I had shared with you earlier shows an evolution of ideas. When everyone around you is telling you how superior one religion is over another, the temptation to simply pander to the majority can be extremely powerful. Respecting women and dalits is not modern view. People of same era as that of Tilak also have done it. He was an oppressor who dint care even if a 11 year old girl was raped in the name of marriage and supported the husband in that case. His achievements are a waste in front of the crime he committed by supporting oppression of women and dalits. I see but it is still a grey area. For instance Shroddinger was a straight up pedo, but his contribution to developement of quantom theory just can't be ignored I'm NOT denying his contributions. I also never deny the contributions of the ultra-left/right-wing freedom fighters then. But humanity comes first. Freedom means freedom of society and mind. BUT nationalism is total BS. It means collective narcissism. > Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind. Albert Einstein someone in comments said that this other face of Tilak is mentioned in ICSE syllabus. Better bring this change to all the text books. Let all know what kind of a man he was. I request you to post those views of Ambedkar in a separate thread. Lets discuss there. quite the opposite actually. thereâs a reason our uniform is black and white. If a person has committed a crime, his achievements arenât taken into consideration while sentencing him. That is exactly what black and white means. All are equal in front of the law. I get where youâre coming from, but that really doesnât apply to a situation like this. By your logic, hitlerâs animal protection laws, his anti smoking campaigns, literal start of Volkswagen all should also be taught alongside his heinous crimes? I refuse to believe that that is the right way to go about things in any world. have a good day I think that misogyny and other regressive views, however horrible, cannot be compared to directly harming someone. As I have been saying repeatedly, it isn't that the views came out of thin air. If someone were to hold such views today, it would undoubtedly be reprehensible. However, when one looks at 21st century India, imagining how it would have been for those born in the 19th century is not too hard. A person's views are bound to be moulded by their culture and their close ones. If someone manages to look beyond colonial propaganda and regionalism (when he could have had a comfortable life being a servant of the Empire), then I don't think that this should be casually dismissed. I don't think that we should ever ignore the bad. However, I refuse to rush past even a fragment of something valuable. Also, I don't think that I need to mention that Mr Tilak was not financing a genocide and did not order his opponents to be murdered/executed. And even in the worst places, there can be something useful. What the world will make of me, I do not know, my friend. What it has made me as a consequence of empathetic people like you, I am only beginning to appreciate. In spite of any ideological differences, I will always be grateful for that. I hope that you and everyone else here will have a nice day/night! no I am not an idealist and expecting a basic human behaviour from Tilak is not expecting something very perfect or ideal. Its just a basic sense any human must have which Tilak lacked. Thanks for enlightening us on purpose of history. Also please accept that these corrupt people must not be hyped in any way. Unfortunately, failure to act on multiple sides has fuelled a kind of absolutism that threatens to eternally incarcerate us in acrimony unless we are careful. Here the aim is to make it clear how corrupt was Tilak and he does not deserve any respect for the views he held. Nothing to learn from a guy who supported a person who raped and killed a 11 year old girl after marrying her. Rant is what you are doing. seriously you have no work? nothing to keep busy that you are worrying abt people from older times??? More than Tilak it should be about anyone who quotes \"Hindu law\"(or any other religious law) to defend a despicable act. He was not against women? Oh, yeah, he was against even the existence little girls. When a 11 year old Phulamani Bai died because of having sexual intercourse(raped) by her much older husband, your great grey hero, told *the little girl was having defective female organs*. One should be ashamed to even write a comment as yours. A 11 year old girl, named Phulamani Bai died, because of sexual intercourse(rape) by her much older husband. Do you know what your great Tilak told? **He blamed the girl for having \"defective female organs\" and questioned how the husband could be \"persecuted diabolically for doing a harmless act\". He called the girl one of those \"dangerous freaks of nature\".** And you are here arguing how he is a complex human, who has to be rewarded for his contribution in independence? Have you seen an 11 year old? Do you know how young they are? For many slavery is worse than living itself. Tilak supported a guy who married a 11 year old girl and killed her while having intercourse. many women are saying they would rather die instead of imagining living in Tilak's era. I already agreed that I am not focusing on the consequence. However I am against the corrupt mindset of Tilak which is not acceptable at all. You are saying there is no enough evidence to say that primary reason why Mr Tilak was advocating for independence was to oppress dalits and women. But I am saying that this is evident from his statements in two different cases of child marriage. He was an oppressor and would continue it even if Swaraj was given by British. Rukhmabai got pardoned by Empress Victoria herself and went on to become one of India's first women doctors. In this case, British were better than Tilak. Even under British rule, there were high chances that Ambedkar would bring many changes in the laws irrespective of India being independent or not. If everyone had given up to this temptation, then Dalits could never have improved at all. As educated person, there is nothing wrong to expect from Tilak some progressive thoughts which he lacked. Ambedkar was a much better person than all those freedom fighters. >quite the opposite actually. thereâs a reason our uniform is black and white. If a person has committed a crime, his achievements arenât taken into consideration while sentencing him. That is exactly what black and white means. All are equal in front of the law. Yes true.. That's what I have been trying to say.. Call him out for his flaws.. No one is asking to spare him. That doesn't mean his works towards freedom should be removed or not acknowledged. Second factor to be considered is the time period.. You can't judge someone of the past via modern lens. >. By your logic, hitlerâs animal protection laws, his anti smoking campaigns, literal start of Volkswagen all should also be taught alongside his heinous crimes? I refuse to believe that that is the right way to go about things in any world. To form an unbiased opinion it is required to know everything. I m not saying Hitler should be spared because of animal protection laws.. Let's know that he passed such laws but ALSO KNOW of the crimes he committed.. This itself is an example of how everyone has both positive and negative in them..Hitler predominantly acted in a negative inhuman ways that should be punished. I have no issues if Tilak ji is being called out for his views.. Yeah he wasn't the perfect man... Had this post has been just pointing out one of the many sides of a man we learnt in history, I have no qualms.. But a man of the past is being judged via current era. Also his other efforts towards society is being undermined because of one of his many views. Like someone said earlier, we shouldn't idolise... Know the man wasn't the perfect, just like us and he did what he could for the society back then. The best we can do in life to move forward as a society is to know the good and bad of everything (as much as possible) and try to inculcate the positives and throw away those negatives in our lives. >if say a person commits rape He didn't >Hitler did some great things in his time If he did some good things we can take inspiration from them and criticize him for the bad >Am i to believe that youâd want to sit and have a cup of tea with him to discuss all the good heâs done? Bruh you can't compare Hitler with Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Going by that logic even Mahatma Gandhi was not perfect either. So we shouldn't respect him. Nehru ji also took many wrong decisions so should we disrespect him. Even you at some point maybe did something wrong so should you be hated for that one thing? In textbooks we should praise Gangadhar for his good deeds and criticize him for the bad. shit. this man is just problematic. Yes. Sometimes we need to say things to make it clear about views of persons like Tilak. There is a reason to worry about people from past. If we critisize and say that Tilak was wrong, atleast a handful of readers who went through this post will know his real face and whenever a child says Tilak is my role model, then he can be shown the other side of his face. By doing so, the child when he grows up wont feel his childhood was a lie or wont continue supporting Tilak just because he did support him from childhood. You too seem very busy by adding comments that do not add any value!! anything about bhagat singh? Yeah like it was like that BECAUSE of people like that. Yup..I kinda feel the pandemic sort of changed people's views on life and society in general.. Yeah that can be digestible(ik its not but still). But in Tilak's case,we are teaching about his spirit and ethics to children while instilling the idea of a secular,democratic India in them.I don't want a casteist there.The truth is that he actually advocated and proactively harmed these communities by making inflammatory statements.It's not like he said it in passing.When the minorities finally get its proportionate representation,he will be rightfully cancelled. OP you see these people in comment section justifying Tilak? This is how such people are always revered. Majority of people, despite education, remain blind, BY CHOICE. If I had a dollar every time someone said \"they are human and not perfect\". He was a leader for what then? Jingoism? shame on this justification. It is obvious since it least concerns you. THIS! OP thanks for this post. Share reference ,bro ..... I would not bother with debating this too much. Seems like it's created by a new troll account. created 5 threads in the last 12 hours on \"hot button\" topics. Not one of their comments are willing to have any nuance in their views, just moral absolutism. Most charitable view is that they are doing this just to troll or generate engagement/hate/reactions, less charitable view is they will quote replies from this thread out of context to do even more of the same. If we truly look at it, British left on their own. The whole struggle for freedom was an illusion. There was mutiny in British army and lack of resources. But well, we have had a problem with accepting truth. If true, this is indeed utterly evil and disgraceful. Cases like these give us a good indication of how conservative Mr Tilak's views were. This is why I am not defending the absolute greatness of Mr Tilak. Rather, I am only suggesting that the good should not be ignored. Much can be said about the personal life of Martin Luther King Jr, but it would be unwise to think that this somehow erases his contribution towards the cause of emancipation of African-Americans. People should definitely be condemned for immoral behaviour. Although, I think that we should also mention that child marriages were the norm for a long time for many people, and Mr Tilak's father was hardly a man with a liberal background. Mr Tilak also advocated widow marriages. He also congratulated Dhondo Keshav Karve when he married a widow after the death of their first wife. He was in the favour of social reforms but without the interference of British Government. If you mention something at least elaborate on it instead of saying google bro So ranting changes others' opinion ??? smooth. So ranting changes others' opinion ??? smooth. People succumb to some and resist others. The latter, wherever and whenever it occurs, deserves to be celebrated. And I think that it is reasonable to expect people to have done better. I, as a Hindu, have routinely thought about why Adi Shankaracharya did not do more for reforming society despite being a proponent of a philosophy that believed in an ultimate unity. I would simply add that these expectations exist coterminously with a recognition of the other side of the coin. Dude, child marriages between children were common. Both Gandhi and Kasthuri bai were of the same age. Even then, marrying an 11 year old child to a very older man was considered wrong. I don't understand how you can defend him at all. He actively protested against the increase of girls age in child marriages. By your logic, you should be seeing a complex person in Winston Churchill, not an oppressor who killed millions of people in the Bengal famine, just a flawed hero who destroyed the Nazis. You should be proud of the British too. Shocking and sad. With the incidents quoted in the wiki page, itâs not just \"casual\" misogynae where he feels women must find fulfilment in marriage, kids, cooking, nurturing, always be \"nice\", never raise their voice etc. He actually supported child marriage, allowing age of consent as 10 years, and victim blamed a child who died due to marital rape. Today, my list of heroes became shorter > Why Because it's a Spectrum not a Binary. People associated with Freedom Struggle exist on a hierarchy or a distribution. Lets take for example those Indians who had current age (2023) egalitarian/moral positions in 19th & early 20th century India during Freedom Struggle BUT the caveat being they were compradors for the British. Such persons DO NOT have equivalent relevance/hierarchy on the Context of the Freedom Movement. They are lower to those who were sexist but still against the British. Those who were less sexist and also against the Britsh were even higher. Those who were not sexist as we'd understand it today (though Sexism itself is a Spectrum, it is not Absolute) and also against the British were higher still. Hence a Spectrum is formed. The only way you could argue for these egalitarian compradors to be better & worthy of being elevated to highest honor/reverence/hero-homage, etc position would be IF you detach human condition with human Polity/State/Group dynamics. And at that point human social contract with group/society/state is broken and Moral ground is assumed to have not only an Isolated/Standalone paradigm but also dominant judgment-casting instrument. Yet this is an exercise that will fail even philosophically since there is no such thing as Absolute Universal Eternal Inalienable \"Moral\". It is era & society/culture dependent. In an era when entire freaking world's societies existed on a sexist spectrum, the Normalization principle is in effect. One judges sexists today with a rightfully harsh lens because the wider society at large/scale (not just global norms but our own Legal norms, like Constitution) has taken a different turn & moved on/evolved. Hence Tilak's position \"in Freedom Movement\" is fine enough as it is. If a ranking were to be created for \"Best Non-Sexists\" then Tilak being positioned high on that list would be a different argument. But we're not dealing with that List/Context. I left this comment in response to someone else: \"If true, this is indeed utterly evil and disgraceful. Cases like these give us a good indication of how conservative Mr Tilak's views were. This is why I am not defending the absolute greatness of Mr Tilak. Rather, I am only suggesting that the good should not be ignored.

Mr Tilak also advocated widow marriages (something that was anathema to conservative Hindus). He also congratulated Dhondo Keshav Karve when he married a widow after the death of their first wife. He was in the favour of social reforms but without the interference of British Government.\" I agree that, tragically, a breaking point does come for many. Nonetheless, there are those who persist despite facing immense hardships. This obviously doesn't mean that it's somehow okay to discriminate, but it does show that there are components of life that are not easy to comprehend. The role of identity and hope can often be contradictory and bizarre. This is a good case in point: Corruption and purity in man frequently coexist. We cannot pretend that the former is a lie, but neither can we assert that the latter is untrue. Misogyny is not acceptable; freedom (for many innocent beings) is. A few examples don't show a humungous trend. And, again, the easiest way to ensure oppression would have been to collaborate with the British and convince them how the Indian elites and the Western elites should work together by continuously pummelling others. Gandhi had some questionable things too but he still is the father of the nation. I'm not saying that Gandhi should not be followed, but a nation needs its heroes that its people can look up to. It may not matter that the person the people look up to may be different or completely opposite to what he actually was. Also, if we go digging, every freedom fighter or any notable person from Indian history will have a few skeletons in their closet. Lets dig There are many things to learn. I donât contest Tilak being a misogynist. But he still possesses a rightful legacy in the history of India and the freedom struggle. Also Iâd suggest ask the same question in r/Pune. You should get more interesting/informed views there hopefully. But honestly, why? At least for people like Gandhi and Savarkar there is a political motivation, but for most others, there really is no reason to. For people like Tilak, it makes no sense to expose all his questionable beliefs. I mean, even Hitler had positives, so you can not expect any human to be ideal. New revolutionary ha? That's how it works man. You're gonna be disappointed all your life. Almost everyone in history will fail your test if you conduct them by modern standards. And you are right about not wanting to respect them, it is 100% valid. But from experience, I can tell you that if you keep looking too deep into history, you will most often end up dejected. My advice, for what it's worth, is to try to segregate the important things. Things that positively affected the world. Take those, add some of your own opinions, and form a moral compass for yourself. Since you are able to separate their bullshit, it means you are on the right track. Appreciating some freedom fighter's (or any historical figure's) work doesn't mean you have to agree to each and every thing they said or believed. Let's save this for people who are alive and actually contributing to current affairs and society. This happened recently. I am not defending evil; I am saying that moral perception is deeply affected by our society and that, just as good actions don't make bad ones magically disappear, the darker elements don't end the positive ones either. I actually agree that Mr Churchill should not be blindly hated the way he is by many. Of course, he was far from the great hero those in the West think he was. However, if he had not resisted the Nazi onslaught and not decided against having any alliance with them, humanity would have faced a much darker future. Europe would have been lost, and the number of deaths could have doubled as rhe Nazis went on unhindered. On the Bengal famine, I think that the following excerpt provides an interesting counterview: \"By January 1944, Bengal had received a total of 130,000 tons of barley from Iraq, 80,000 tons of wheat from Australia and 10,000 from Canada, followed by a further 100,000 from Australia. Then, on 14 February 1944, Churchill called an emergency meeting of the war cabinet to see if more food aid could be sent to Bengal without wrecking Allied plans for the coming Normandy landings. âI will certainly help you all I can, but you must not ask the impossible,â telegraphed Wavell before the cabinet met. âhttps://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/masani-bengal-famine/ The website most likely tries to whitewash Churchill, but some basic facts are probably unaltered. I am proud of humanity irrespective of when, where, and how it comes into being. This is why I feel honoured to live at a time when there are compassionate people like you in the world. Sometimes, it feels as if unrestricted materialism and consumerism have subdued all moral impulses. However, the passion and dedication of you and others here is a reminder that all is far from lost. Thank you for your comment, and I hope that you will have a good day! Bruh You can search and read about it, Fairly common knowledge. Doing a thread will be exhaustive lol Neutrality is the cloak of a coward. In the realm of polar views, danger lurks. I am not brave enough to cease fearing collective degradation, my friend. Thank you for your replies, and may you have a great day/night. Idolize only THA7A for the same reason we have pdfile on our currency Same case with killing animals for food. Historical context. Churchill and Gandhi were racist against a certain group of people but that doesn't take away from their key contributions. The same goes for Tilak. Cause he was a good leader for the freedom movement against the British. His social beliefs were the same as found at the time in society. He was a political leader, not social. If you want a social leader then you need to check out Gopal Ganesh Agarkar. Are you a fucking idiot? Do you think that the death toll due to the British Raj was 3000? It's because being a pedo is unrelated to quantum theory. But being against human rights while being a political activist is very much a big deal. >Do you think no innocent was ever killed by the militant freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh? God what a chad. Antisemitism was normal in the Weimar Republic. Guess Heidegger wasn't all that bad. Tens of millions of people died but atleast we got the train, eh. Congress has consistently downplayed Netaji's achievements and glorified Gandhi. This is nationalism in a nutshell. Not common knowledge .. because there were no such views... you are probably a victim of propaganda which is promoted in recent years to vilify people who genuinely worked hard for the betterment of our society which included fighting against dogmas existing in our Hindu society. There is a systematic organized campaign to vilify leaders such as Nehru and Ambedkar years to damage their legacy. Few days ago a friend who is a self professed sanghi casually stated. \"Nehru was a Muslim. His father was born a Muslim and changed his name for political favours. Their family practiced Islam at home\" . How can one argue with such a level of brainwash ? Yes. You should be disappointed in disappointing humans. Reading that about Tilak, if true, it is part of his legacy that he was a bigot. By your logic everyone should be respected. You seem like you need some awakening of your own. Tilak's idea of freedom was having a rigid society which followed the varna system. When Chattrapati Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur declared that Marathas were a martial race and should be assigned higher status in the society, Tilak even suggested that the Marathas should *be \"content\" with the Shudra status* assigned to them by the Brahmins. Wait are there any constitutional rights that women don't have that men have?infact many laws such as rape etc font even even consider men as victims along with reduced sentences for women for same crime.so I would say more than equal.yhe implementation is a different topic Ofcourse there can be different perspective to see things. Sangh also got \"banned\" multiple times, but I am sure you'd most probably contest it also and call it suppressive, unfair and unjust. I'd say regular citizens might not have been aware of this fact earlier but now plenty of us understand that there was, and are people of different ideology who don't believe and align with the values of constitution of India. So I suggest you guys should also stop confusing/pretending that we are on same page and are talking about same thing. Ofcourse guruji told his followers to wait for the freedom struggle for 'india' to end and then take over the country, it's your time now, best of luck! Yup that's what I meant about him being an imperfect human..Lol I'm more disappointed looking at the comments section rather than the views of Tilak who died a long time ago.. Whatever role he played in the society, be it good Or bad isnt as important as current state of affairs.. Yes he was. No doubt about it. You just mentioned his attitude towards women. Check the Vedokta controversy where he showed his casteist attitude. Or his books Arctic home of the Vedas and The Orion which shows his racist attitude. His hatred of moderates like Gopal Krishna Gokhale. It is also completely hidden that his son committed suicide due to pressure from Tilakites and his suicide letter was posted to three people and one then being Ambedkar and none of the letters were sent to Tilak. Bal Gangadhar Tilak is completely whitewashed. Check the story of Tilak's son and why he committed suicide. It is interesting how history is nicely hidden from people, because we are more interested in Instagram reels. Columbus is being rightfully cancelled tho. Yeah I think it's important to remember that most of these people are a product of their time. Appreciate what they've done for the country and what they're recognised for, and acknowledge that they weren't perfect by miles. Never idolize anyone blindly. You're being really unfair here, he lived over 100 years ago. His views are alike of others at that time. He did what he felt was right at that time. He does need to be taught about and so does his misogynism. That's how you analyze leaders. I wish Queen Victoria would have pardoned her colonies in a similar way. Guess leaders are always selective. I would any day prefer people with zero common sense over people who want to steal and create famines. Don't forget cricket and the language. /s C'mon don't speak like a clown. Nehru being muslim and such low IQ propaganda is different. Left leaning and writers sympathetic to Ambedkar have written extensively about it. You are simply too lazy to check... Folks like you hardly read much and go around doing writing anything w/o thinking Tharoor ain't a sanghi IG. Also constituent assembly debates are available online. Can look at them Slightly different take on this. Idolize people, but revisit them with your new set of ideals every few years as you evolve. The same reason why we call Gandhi fatger of nation. Because they had a significant part in the freedom of India. \"Real heroes are never as polished as the legends that surround them.\" Basically he'd be a sanghi Whatsapp uncle if he was alive today. > Mr Tilak also advocated widow marriages (something that was anathema to conservative Hindus). He also congratulated Dhondo Keshav Karve when he married a widow after the death of their first wife. Citation please? Lokmanya my ass, remove his freaking name from everywhere He lived in different Era and did a lot of great works for India . He was the first one who tried to raise masses for independence. Paving way for Gandhiji later on A lot of great people had backwards views because they lived in different Times Look bro, you can't judge someone in the past with the present world's morals. We are talking about an era which had a different culture. Can we just focus on what right things he said and move on, instead of looking for negative things about our historical leaders? Nobody's perfect, we all are flawed. What did we do in life matters more. Even though I may consider myself a better thinking individual, I can never have the courage to stand against the oppressors as much as they did. Or, I am not in a position to question others, when I have achieved nothing in my life. I'd prefer to focus on my development by finding positive sources to grow, instead of finding nooks of our respected leaders only to degrade them. Applying modern day sensibilities to any historical figures is going to lead to disappointment. Similar to how upcoming generations will apply their sensibilities to us and be disappointed in our generation as well. They have essentially downplayed everyone except M. Gandhi and Nehru-Gandhi family people. The end is idolizing anyone Lol, I ain't getting into a debate here with such a biased sub. You claimed that the current govt tarnishes people but Congress doesn't; so my only point was that Congress has its own share of tarnishing people. He fought the British for Hindu Rashtra the same way as Jinnah fought the British for Islamic state. 1857 revolters fought to place Bahadur Shah Jafar as the emperor. None of these fights were for independence of Indians. gand me bal ka tilak fought this case to prevent British from interfering in Manusmriti affairs that mandate women have to be married off at the age of 8. That's a bullshit, school essay level article and you know it. \"Child marriage disturbed him\"? Right. He was *for* child marriage. You'll find on googling he spoke against people who wanted to remove the custom of tonsuring widows, forget remarriage. Guy was an absolute reactionary even for those times. The Tribume is not a disreputable source, even if the quality of the writing varies. People's views can often change and yet remain conflicting in places. I do agree that many of his views concerning women (and some other people) are absolutely unethical. These are all the same kind of article and probably sourced from one another; if they dont have a true source or context they dont count. It's like a school essay saying random nice sounding bullet points. You forget I can google too, and find that he was for child marriage, against widow remarriage, against women's education. If we wish to constantly doubt, there is no source that cannot be questioned. After all, one could also ask if the person writing a book or article giving an apparent \"true context\" was not misled/biased. I didn't forget anything. But I did not find any link that gave conclusive evidence that he was against widow remarriage. There were some places that mentioned that he was, but they were from blogs. On the other hand, The Tribune is quite a trustworthy source and usually does not spread propaganda. Finally, my sole focus was on widow remarriage. Sorry but giving crap sources and saying no source cannot be questioned in defence is really weak. Not having strong contradiction sources and strangely throwing away a 142-year-old newspaper as being \"cr*p\" is rather flimsy. I finally found the book where I had first read about Mr Tilak's views on widow remarriage. It is called 'Lokmanya Tilak: A Biography'. Written by A.K. Bhagwat and G.P. Pradhan, this book's foreword was written by none other than Dr Radhakrishnan, who was India's President and also a renowned philosopher. The book directly quotes Mr Tilak: âThere has been much talk about social reforms. But we have to bear in mind that we have to reform the masses and if we dissociate ourselves from them, reforms would become impossible. The outstanding example of this is the fact that though widow-remarriage is a desirable reform, most of the reformers cannot practise it in their families. I therefore think that each one should start reforms from himself and convert others through practice rather than by mere theory...\" No he doesn't. I think one post on r/India is enough. It makes sense. Let us be clear of their narrow mindedness and corrupt mindset so that they are not appreciated blindly. His positives do not count in front of his evil deeds to humanity. Lets stop respecting all these people of history who dint respect humanity and treated fellow men as equal. If it means that we need to reject all, it's fine with me. Lets reject all. Thanks for advice, but somehow I am not convinced to consider it. Appreciating some work of a criminal makes his crime look balanced. Hence no respect for him. No it's not. You and a dalit or women belong to the same species. Atleast start by treating them as equal. We shall come to treating different species as a next step. Lets go one step at a time. Yes it does make their contribution insignificant. Both Gandhi and Churchill have committed crime against humanity. No he was a bad guy. He was having oppressor mindset. Such person is unfit for being called a leader, be it political or social. Correct. I agree. Thanks for providing these useful information. Appreciate it. No. His views were far lower than his fellow men. Both are equally bad. Choosing one bad guy over other is not gonna bring any good. No he was not . He was a casteist. Please read my reply to people who mentioned he lived in different era. Tired of typing same replies. It's not present day morals. Okay bro. Goodluck living in a black and white world. Cheers! It's not his negative. It is greatest crime to have such sick mindset. No. It's is not modern day sensibility applied here. Thank you. How does that change the fact that he played significant role in freedom? We (India) already chose one of them and the choice was not that difficult. So this is basically *against* reformers who wanted to allow widow remarriage. It's the equivalent of saying ending slavery is desirable but slavery should not be abolished, it should be left to the slave owners. This is reactionary and disingenous and to spin this as Tilak being against widow remarriage is a huge stretch at best. My brother in Christ, if we compare everything in life, we will never gain happiness, just take the good habits and ignore the bad ones(mostly), no one can be ideal, your argument if very flawed It was not against the reformers; it was _for_ them to go further than they already had. He explicitly said that it was \"desirable\". Something desirable is something that one believes to be good. If you believe that love is desirable, you are simultaneously saying that hatred is undesirable. Also, Mr Tilak was not saying that widow remarriage should not be supported. His point was that it should have a practical element, which is why he used the word \"mere\". This is similar to how you one would say that friendship is not merely a word, but also an experience that is a consequence of the actions of individuals. I fear that you are unnecessarily extending and distorting the meaning of something quite obvious. And I don't disagree with your broader point about Mr Tilak having dangerously outworn. Yet, our initial inclinations don't have to shape everything. Without him blocking women education, more women have had access to education and would have indirectly helped in fast pacing of freedom movement. Also if he supported abolishing untouchability, dalits would have participated with even more enthusiasm. He discouraged a great part of society and their development. Yeah.. we did a mistake and let's atleast stop respecting these undeserving people. No it is not flawed. I am getting peace for calling out a false leader and saying that he does not deserve respect. False leader? Name me five perfect leaders rn and then see, even I am against bootlicking but calling this man a false leader, cmon man. This man was a GREAT leader, not the best yes, but great. No arguments and anyways I left debates 2 years ago, just make peace brother and stop comparing, you will see a life full of joy, alas I still can't do the same. I don't have IG or FB or twitter etc and there are other things in life that unfortunately take precedence over knowing history. Also, you may know some history I don't know and vice versa. I couldn't find any reference to \" Bal Gangadhar Tilak pretty much called Raja Ram Mohan Roy a namard \" and while thanks to you, I know a bit more about his son's suicide, I really don't see relation between Tilak calling guy namard and his suicide. I will await source from someone then. Thanks. That doesn't change the fact that he had a significant role in the freedom struggle. No he was NOT GREAT. A man who supports a person for killing a 11 year old girl by having sexual intercourse can NEVER BE GREAT. I have already said that if there is none in history who can be respected, then be it. Lets not respect cheap mentality people. This just says that he had significant role in delaying progress of Indian society. No. this says he could've had a bigger role in the development of Indian society but it didn't. Now you asked why he is considered a national hero. He is considered that for his role in freedom of India, unless you can prove that he had not role in freedom of India any argument you make is moot. A great leader can be a bad man, Napoleon was a fantastic military commander but a shit man overall. Look bro, let's just leave this topic, I am just a teen out here trying to find joy in life. I don't want to add more sadness into my life and I will be ignorant yet alert. Yeah his idea of freedom is only wrong. Freedom where he does not value women of house. Freedom where he can practice untouchability with dalits. If this was the mindset with which he carried out each of his dharnas or activities, then his actions must not be appropriated at all. He was a HUGE hindrance to India and its progression or development. Shit men are shit men. That's all. Ok you can leave it here. That doesn't change the fact that he had a significant role in the freedom struggle. Yes it does. Time to see him as hindrance than enabler. Nope. Social progress != freedom. Yes it is. Freedom and progress go hand in hand. So why neglect the freedom part? Because what he did was to give illusion of fighting for freedom whereas in real all he did was hindering the progress. So you're saying his active campaign against British hindered the progress of Indian freedom? No his opposition to women education did. I studied in a college named after him You missed my point so I'd repeat it, the motive is important. Don't know about Tilak's mention of Roy. Tilak's mouthpiece was the \"Mahrahtta\" and \"Kesari\" you could check it. There are many controversial articles written by him which never are mentioned. What oppressor mindset ? He actually promoted public celebration of Ganeshotsav & Shiv jayanti to unite people on public forums and create a strong united voice against oppressive British rule. He opened schools to educate kids in maths and English. Does that sound oppressive to you. Just because some of his views are opposite of your views don't make him a bad guy. He opposed the establishment of first native girls high school in Pune. If he was a good man, he wouldn't have done it. You said he opened school for kids. Then are girl kids not fit ? Is it what his thought process? Why he opposed opening of girls school? He was a hypocrite. You say British as oppressors but not Tilak. This is so wrong. Both were equally bad. If he wanted to unite public, he could have supported the reforms against untouchability which he didn't . Hence he does not deserve any respect. Can you give me any source that he opposed a girl's school? It's in the post itself. Where is the post taken from ? I have read articles & stories about Tilak regularly since I live in Mumbai. I have never read/heard about this story involving the Young girlÅ death. I kno about his conservative views about hindu religion & traditions. I kno that he opposed many laws because he didnt want British & other non hindus to make decisions for Hindus. But I have never heard/read about these extreme views described in the article. References are mentioned in Wikipedia itself. You wish to decide steps for me? Let me decide my steps.. how is that for a start.. one step at a time.. He decided independence is first.. that's step one for him.. Good for you!! All the best with your steps. Thanks.. You've been understanding and encouraging towards others opinions. By your logic Islam religion would not exist. \"Aisha was 6 or 7 yrs old during her marriage that makes him a pedo so people who follow that religion are pedos\". What kind of logic r u implying? \"Einstein married his cousin so anyone who studies relativity likes incest\". If any person is dumb enough to follow that logic them no single human being deserves recognition. Not everyone are saints. Or r u saying that u r a perfect human being? I believe that they should specify more details of their bad sides too, while it's true he fought fir nation it's also true he was an Orthodox hindu and a misogynist. When students will learn both sides they will learn to weight these so called great freedom fighters themselves, but it's not gonna happen since texts like these are also meant to invoke a national spirit inside the students. Also now you know what kinda effect education can have on a students mind, and now you know why some people were pissed over exclusion of some chaoters from ncert. (I don't support anyone, I support reason, I am not saying whether it was right or wrong to remove those chapters) ð He wasn't exactly good nor a super evil guy if you wanna learn an unbaised opinion on him read shekar bandhopadhyay's \"plassey to partition\" Chapter 5 , subtopic: 5.2 Not just women. He was a casteist. He was opposed to laws that gave Dalits right and he was also pro-Child brides. He also opposed the Age of Consent Act. Disgusting trash. op is saying exactly that. If you are showing his good side in text books then his other side must be shown as well. Let there be debates in classroom and let students decide which side had more weightage. This is how one should learn history. Unfortunately we are taught just to follow someone blindly because he participated in freedom struggle, with their horrible side completely supressed. What would be use of freedom if such people had prevailed, When part of people in your own society would never get taste of this freedom yes. you should be disappointed with humans like these. That's the sign of good human being And Wikipedia is your primary source of information?? God help your intelligence I also despises him."
