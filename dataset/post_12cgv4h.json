He has gotten all his injections, vaccinations, balls been cut, etc. He will turn 1 by the end of May.\n\nI need help with things to buy for him and to take care of him. Anything that you can share from personal experience would be lovely. \n\n1. If you could give me links to buy some nice interactive games/toys. Too many options on Amazon and would like to pick something that someone has used. \n\n2. Link for those 3way or 5way tunnels or any such items that you may have purchased. \n\n3. What feed do you use? I used Whiskas. Basically the stock my friend gave me. But have bought Royal Canin last time. It's 3 times as expensive. Is it worth it?\n\n4. What treats do you give? The store next to my house has limited options. \n\n5. What litter do you use? And how frequently do you change it? \n\n6. How frequently do you bathe your cute little monster? Haven't bathed him yet. Will mostly take him outside and get it done because I don't know how to do it. \n\n7. I will never cut his nails. Have done my research on that part. \n\n8. Lint remover. I need one badly. \n\nSorry for the long post. Video of him jumping around for your patience üòÉ",

        "Hey! Fellow cat daddy here!  \n\n\n3. If you can invest some time into his food, get chicken from a butcher, mince and boil it and feed it to him. My kitten loves it, and I feed it to him on alternate days.   \nBased on how big your cat is, around 90-100grams chicken a day should do. You can basically buy 700 grams chicken at once and keep it frozen in the freezer for the week.   \nAsk your butcher to add liver + heart (around 100 grams,) and some chicken heads all totaling 700 grams.   \n**This is SUPER cost effective. In Mumbai where I live, it costs me Rs. 300 for 1KG of meat.** So like, for my kitten who is tiny, I buy 500 grams at once, and Rs.150 is done for the week.   \n*I mince it when I get it home and store it in tiny boxes. Becomes super easy to defreeze and boil too.*  \n\n\n**If possible, prefer dedicated pet websites like SuperTails or HeadsUpForTails**.   \n[https://headsupfortails.com/products/sheba-rich-chicken-premium-loaf-wet-kitten-food-box-1-68-kg](https://headsupfortails.com/products/sheba-rich-chicken-premium-loaf-wet-kitten-food-box-1-68-kg) this is a good option for the cost effective wet food. it comes down to around Rs.48 per pack if you buy this box. So similar to whiskas but better quality food.   \n\n\nALSO, avoid dry food. And feed him a variety of foods so he doesn't get addicted to just one.  \n\n\n4. **Me-O Wet treats** are great. **Temptations** dry treats are great too, especially for training. But cats are very selective, so you might have to try a few treats before he settles on one. So don't go overboard and buy a lot of them. (I made that mistake and suffered :') )  \n\n\n5. This lasts me around 3 - 3.5 months [https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09CYM1BKT/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o04\\_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09CYM1BKT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) .\n\nCats like their litter boxes clean, so I'd clean it every morning AT LEAST.   \n\n\n6. You'll find dry shampoos online, you can use those instead of bathing. Cats clean themselves, so only bathe them if they've like become SUPER dirty, have been in the mud or have ticks on them.  \n\n\n7. I think you should cut his nails. But also make sure you have scratch pads/posts in your house.  \n\n\n  \nP.S. HE IS SUPER CUTE!!!",
        "I bought my outside cat a couple of toys which she never played with. Then she found a string with balls attached to it that she loves playing with whenever she's feeling like giving out bunny kicks. You can try buying her fake mouses or feathers on a stick, but she'll probably end up playing with a box or a string. \n\nI buy Whiskas for her. I try to make sure every serving is half dry and half wet food, so it's cheaper to feed her without compromising her health. It seems like you might be loaded, so you don't have to worry about getting the cheapest option. I can't tell you what the best brand is. You should try r/pets or r/Indianpets.\n\nFor treats, I get Temptations or Me O Creamy. The treats have more calories, so make sure you use those rarely or when you're training her. I've seen some owners give one treat before bed each night.\n\nYou don't need to change the litter. Just cleaning by scooping is enough.\n\nYou're right; you don't need to cut the nails (usually). But you do need to provide a scratching post if you don't want to get all of your furniture torn up.\n\nCats don't need baths usually. They clean themselves. But if your cat gets too dirty to clean itself or gets covered in something she shouldn't ingest, give her a bath immediately. She'll probably hate it and fight you all the way. Wear thick, long gloves or something because she'll try to tear you up.",

Something \"with real chicken\" means just 25% chicken, something labelled just chicken or fish imply its just 3%, that too cheaper non-veg matter like liver.\n\nCompared to that normal meat from butcher shop is far far far cost effective. Along with liver and heart bits, you may also go for skin and gizzard pieces. Boneless fish is also good. For chicken I boil extra long such that the bone pieces fully softens up and not pose a hazard.\n\nOne thing that the above options can't provide is Taurine, so feeding a packed food once a week is useful. I go for Sheba's pumpkin chicken for the Taurine and the pumpkin enzymes. Also a mix of Samolac enzymes and probiotic powders to fill any other gap.\n\nRegarding dry food it depends on how much your cats drink water. Most house cats raised from kittens at home will drink good amount of water. One my cat only eats wet, another only eats dry but they consume water accordingly.

Its in these conglomerates' interest that pet cats(and dogs) develop hepatic and renal problems from undigestable things in their food(and from other bad diets), at which the point the same companies will sell hepatic/renal vet food for \"ageing\" pets; selling a solution to a problem the same companies contributed to. \n\nPedigree also by Mars as Whiskas, Sheba, RC are, had SEVEN major global recalls in TEN years. RC had 4 which is also bad.\n\n\nFarmina/Matisse is equally bad. Their lamb mouse has 20% chicken, 5% lamb, rest all grains. I have lost hope in packed petfood industry especially on the wetfood department. On the dryfood luckily these days Orijen, Taste of the Wild, Acana, arden-grange are available in India.

Completely off topic, but that bedsheet looks familiar huh ? r/beatmetoit You can safely trim a cat's nails carefully without hurting them. You cannot cut the entire nail, that's extremely painful.

Me-ow dry food is also good. My 2 Cats love the Mackerel flavour. I don't have a kitty litter. Instead trained both the Cats to pee & shit next to the drain in the bathroom. I give my Cats bath twice a month, especially the Persian because of the long fur. The Vet was suggesting a weekly bath but 2 times a month is fine. Even I don't cut their nails often. If taking the Cats to be groomed, they chop off the nails then. You didn‚Äôt get a cat, the cat‚Äôs got you. That is a full grown cat. So cuteüòç Cats are very clean animal if you're seldom unable to clean the litter box they will defecate outside. So a spare litter box is good so that the cat always has options You didn't find it. It found you. It owns you now. Surrender unto it peasant. Submit to the higher order. Just one advice.. don't visit China with your cat Ayo that's a cat dude not a kitten üíÄüíÄüíÄ Hey! Fellow cat daddy here! 3. If you can invest some time into his food, get chicken from a butcher, mince and boil it and feed it to him. My kitten loves it, and I feed it to him on alternate days. Based on how big your cat is, around 90-100grams chicken a day should do. You can basically buy 700 grams chicken at once and keep it frozen in the freezer for the week. Ask your butcher to add liver + heart (around 100 grams,) and some chicken heads all totaling 700 grams. **This is SUPER cost effective. In Mumbai where I live, it costs me Rs. 300 for 1KG of meat.** So like, for my kitten who is tiny, I buy 500 grams at once, and Rs.150 is done for the week. *I mince it when I get it home and store it in tiny boxes. Becomes super easy to defreeze and boil too.* **If possible, prefer dedicated pet websites like SuperTails or HeadsUpForTails**. [https://headsupfortails.com/products/sheba-rich-chicken-premium-loaf-wet-kitten-food-box-1-68-kg](https://headsupfortails.com/products/sheba-rich-chicken-premium-loaf-wet-kitten-food-box-1-68-kg) this is a good option for the cost effective wet food. it comes down to around Rs.48 per pack if you buy this box. So similar to whiskas but better quality food. ALSO, avoid dry food. And feed him a variety of foods so he doesn't get addicted to just one. 4. **Me-O Wet treats** are great. **Temptations** dry treats are great too, especially for training. But cats are very selective, so you might have to try a few treats before he settles on one. So don't go overboard and buy a lot of them. (I made that mistake and suffered :') ) 5. This lasts me around 3 - 3.5 months [https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09CYM1BKT/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o04\\_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09CYM1BKT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) . Cats like their litter boxes clean, so I'd clean it every morning AT LEAST. 6. You'll find dry shampoos online, you can use those instead of bathing. Cats clean themselves, so only bathe them if they've like become SUPER dirty, have been in the mud or have ticks on them. 7. I think you should cut his nails. But also make sure you have scratch pads/posts in your house. P.S. HE IS SUPER CUTE!!! I bought my outside cat a couple of toys which she never played with. Then she found a string with balls attached to it that she loves playing with whenever she's feeling like giving out bunny kicks. You can try buying her fake mouses or feathers on a stick, but she'll probably end up playing with a box or a string. I buy Whiskas for her. I try to make sure every serving is half dry and half wet food, so it's cheaper to feed her without compromising her health. It seems like you might be loaded, so you don't have to worry about getting the cheapest option. I can't tell you what the best brand is. You should try r/pets or r/Indianpets. For treats, I get Temptations or Me O Creamy. The treats have more calories, so make sure you use those rarely or when you're training her. I've seen some owners give one treat before bed each night. You don't need to change the litter. Just cleaning by scooping is enough. You're right; you don't need to cut the nails (usually). But you do need to provide a scratching post if you don't want to get all of your furniture torn up. Cats don't need baths usually. They clean themselves. But if your cat gets too dirty to clean itself or gets covered in something she shouldn't ingest, give her a bath immediately. She'll probably hate it and fight you all the way. Wear thick, long gloves or something because she'll try to tear you up. Tatee katwa do . Make a post Dogs are better no üß¢. my heart üò≠ Bhai iska Naam economy rakh de kya pata woh bhi uchal pade Please do not cut the nails if you don't know cats nails have blood vessels at a certain point better cut them at the vet if needed. Please do not take all advice from the internet without some confirmation for the cays sake. Royal cannin and Whiskas the only difference I found is there poop quality is better when eating royal canning. Poop smell also changes. Yoe can try after consulting the vet. Keep fresh water access for the cat or running water if you can. Try to give him both dry and wet foods to avoid any renal issues when it's gets old as eating habits are hard to change when cats get old. I use Whiskas dry food and Sheba wet food. Whiskas is good enough. As for toys, my cat likes balls. I have a few rattling balls that she likes to chase around. Also bought her chew toys. As for treats, I usually give her Temptations. Either the dry ones or the creamy ones. But give your cat treats sparingly. I use BestClean litter. I think it clumps well and removes smell. Fairly cheap too. Wait until she fucks you and your whole house üè† üòÇ Congratulations man. Nice tag, if you purchased it online, can you please share the link I want to buy one for my Leo üòä üòÇ Set up a cat wall You think cat's nails are only cut in veterinarian office? No . It's a little tricky to cut thier nails but you have to find ideal time when they're in relaxed state to cut their nails. I've done it many times with my two kittens, if one is not deft in handling paws, they can learn from vet but there's nothing wrong in cutting nails, you have to know from which point you should start cutting. &#x200B; 1. Usually, they can play with anything - crumbled paper balls, earbuds, boxes, and bird feather is their favorite. You can get some toys from Amazon: 1. [Toy 1](https://www.amazon.in/REHTRAD-Kittens%EF%BC%8CFeather-Playing-Toys%EF%BC%8CPlush-Colored/dp/B08Z3FFSZN/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2UIVBZJBCWZ02&keywords=cat+toys&qid=1680762707&sprefix=cat+toys%2Caps%2C235&sr=8-5) 2.

Prefer something that has feathers. 4. Also, don't give them all toys at once. Give them one by one. They will lose interest. 2. Your cat seems to a long hair Indian cat (I have the same) 1. For wet food, get Bellota. For a bit premium you can [Sheba](https://www.amazon.in/Sheba-Fish-Skipjack-Salmon-Adult/dp/B079ZLVRTD/ref=sr_1_6?crid=367V5MLNKTUQU&keywords=sheba+cat+food&qid=1680764229&sprefix=sheba+%2Caps%2C287&sr=8-6). BTW, boiled chicken is the best with some pumpkin. 2. For dry food, try Friskies. 3. I really don't like the quality of whiskas. 3. Meo, Sheeba creamy treats. You can also try small chunks ones too. 4. [Bentonite clay litter](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BB9N3B61/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is easily available, but I'll recommend you try the wooden pellet ones(if possible) 5. You don't need to. They clean themselves. There might be rare occasions when the cat is really dirty or has something stuck to the fur then you might need to give it a bath. 6. But get the nails trimmed regularly. Because if they get out of habit it will pain in the ass to get it trimmed (cats being cats) 7.

Feel free to DM me regarding any help/tips. Love that cat with all your heart >What feed do you use? I used Whiskas. Basically the stock my friend gave me. But have bought Royal Canin last time. It's 3 times as expensive. Is it worth it? No. In fact both Whiskas and Royal Canin are made by the same company and both are garbage, i.e. low meat and high sugar and salt. It will ruin your cat's health in the long run. Ideally look for high protein foods - Farmina/Matisse or other brands. They will probably be as expensive as Royal Canin. Of course! I bought it from Petsy. Their website seems to be down right now, but here's the link anyway: This site is down from long time üò¢ Thank you for sharing the link. You want to suggest cutting nails to a 1st time cat owner go ahead. Think about the poor cat in case a mistake happens. I thought they were kittens till the first year of their life. *He *him ... And that's one hell of a name Oh yes, my bad. It actually is. He finally selected me as the person who takes care of him but when I look at him I always feel like he is looking for other options on the side. Flipkart: Logon ko jode! Yes, have done research on this. It's because their vital organs are located there and they naturally feel threatened. But usually not with owners because of the familiarity with touch Post it in the Bangalore sub Kitten till one year. After that adult? You are right! He will turn one in May He will turn one in May He will turn one in may Leo baaga cute ga undi bhaiyya!! Thanks bhayya üòé Oh Name him Walter white That's a shame. I hope they haven't closed shop. He should seek help from veterinarian but down the line he has to learn. It is necessary to cut their nails so that they don't get too long, some cats are lazy and don't scratch enough to taper the long nails which causes discomfort That's a grown ass cat And buy some shelfs and toys for it Thank you for such a detailed reply. This really helps. Haha ... Yeh main kabhi karne wala nahi ...vkya pata kabhi uchhle hi na Chinese chef üíÄ Royal Canin is much much better than Whiskas, which is mainly cornmeal. Check the ingredients. they are listed in order by %. if the 1st thing is corn-based, it's shit. Better to encourage them to poop outdoors. but otherwise: Intersand Cat Scoopable Litter is the best price vs quality Cats are self-cleaning. Okay where is the kitten Remove that thing tied over the cat‚Äôs neck, it can cause some hearing issues in future Sure budd! this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYfFsIeqNnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYfFsIeqNnU) has a great guide on what your cat needs if you're gonna go for meat as his meal. You can easily just stick to chicken, but make sure you **boil** the meat (meat in India isn't tested/processed so it may contain viral diseases). Another IMPORTANT point (unsure if someone posted it): TALK TO YOUR VET! Get your cat vaccinated! Your vet might suggest a Tricat Vaccine AND a rabies vaccine. These have to be administered on a yearly basis. ALSO deworm your cat with medicine every 3 months. AND **STERELIZE** your cat! Talk to your vet and get him to discuss when you should do it. In heat your cat will be a nuisance to you and your house PLUS it's very frustrating for cats when their sexual needs aren't satisfied! Milk can cause an upset stomach depending on the cat. Yes most cats are lactose intolerant, but there are some which are tolerant as well. My cat doesn't drink enough water, which caused him serious bladder stones and complete urinary blockage. He loves milk, now from the past year, he's been getting only wet food with water and milk two times a day. Never had an upset stomach. I want a cat Try kitten Biryani üóø Sell him You need to let him view the outside through the windows. Cats love that. Neutered male cats cat get a huge growth spurt actually. I have one which is less that a year old and weighs 6kgs Only trim like milimeters of nails if the floor is marble tiles or something of smooth-hard surface. If you see nails being reddish, its often because natural (over)grown nails creates a reactive force backwards when cats jump and causes internal bleeding. I would say internal bleeding is worse result. I used to trim in very little bits every week and the reddishness stopped. Whats more my cats have learned to bite their nails when big, along with rubbing their eyes to clean rheum so I don't have to worry anymore. You do not want them to lick and consume such man made chemicals bruh. This is one of those rare case where a wet towel should be used to clean them Just give them curd,yakult or milk fermented with lactobacillus probiotics powders. If the milk has fermented then most of resultant products are digestible for any mammal. only if strangers. my cats tumble all the time so that I may scratch their stomach I was gonna write the same. Considering Royal canin is some 85rs a piece for 85g with even less chicken content. There is a whole fiasco with wordings in petfood industry. Something \"with real chicken\" means just 25% chicken, something labelled just chicken or fish imply its just 3%, that too cheaper non-veg matter like liver. Compared to that normal meat from butcher shop is far far far cost effective. Along with liver and heart bits, you may also go for skin and gizzard pieces. Boneless fish is also good. For chicken I boil extra long such that the bone pieces fully softens up and not pose a hazard. One thing that the above options can't provide is Taurine, so feeding a packed food once a week is useful. I go for Sheba's pumpkin chicken for the Taurine and the pumpkin enzymes. Also a mix of Samolac enzymes and probiotic powders to fill any other gap. Regarding dry food it depends on how much your cats drink water. Most house cats raised from kittens at home will drink good amount of water. One my cat only eats wet, another only eats dry but they consume water accordingly. Another cat was drinking too much water and his poop was always loose, puke too. I had to make him eat a bit of dry food to normalise his stool. u/thejokeyjokerson Toy 2 is really trash I had it. Its cheap bamboo stick with barely connected string and hazardous plastic wool filled toy doll at the end. My cat bit on the sticks enough to potrude out some pointy sharp chips. All the ones below are good teasers I felt in different ways to keep cats engaged: u/thejokeyjokerson OP hear this out, Mars and Nestle has massive duopoly in pet industry and all their products are massproduced, repurposed reject meats and copius amount of undigestable grains. Its in these conglomerates' interest that pet cats(and dogs) develop hepatic and renal problems from undigestable things in their food(and from other bad diets), at which the point the same companies will sell hepatic/renal vet food for \"ageing\" pets; selling a solution to a problem the same companies contributed to. Pedigree also by Mars as Whiskas, Sheba, RC are, had SEVEN major global recalls in TEN years. RC had 4 which is also bad. Farmina/Matisse is equally bad. Their lamb mouse has 20% chicken, 5% lamb, rest all grains. I have lost hope in packed petfood industry especially on the wetfood department. On the dryfood luckily these days Orijen, Taste of the Wild, Acana, arden-grange are available in India. Better to buy boneless chicken and fish and serve boiled. Add in eggs, liver, enzymes and probiotics. Its far economical and far more nutritious. Grain-free foods aren't necessarily safe either. The cornmeal replacement/substitute some companies use have shown to cause other different issues and all those substitutes are not regulated yet, just initial studies to warn of safety. You are protein too, yummm bro then he needs to be barred from going to that place but the reality is that they clean themselves and always smell very fresh like our hair does when we have just shampooed it with a smell less shampoo Now I get it, I clean my commander‚Äôs litter box twice a day. Their website is back up now in case you want to check the tag out. Thank you so much :) ordered few items. ‚ù§Ô∏è Very cute >Instead trained both the Cats to pee & shit next to the drain in the bathroom. May I ask how? When I bought my Persian Cat as a Kitten, she was litter trained. The trick is that you've to take your Kitten or newly adopted Cat to the bathroom & place her right above the bathroom drain hole. They realise & recognize the smell somehow & pee/shit there. When I got my adopted Indie kitten after a year, I did this & she instantly started to use the bathroom for such deeds. They're so hellbent on using the bathroom that if it's occupied at the time they want to use it, they patiently wait outside the door till it opens."
