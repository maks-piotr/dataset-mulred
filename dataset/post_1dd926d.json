Despite ongoing legal battles and activist support, the demolition continues. We need media attention and public support to stop this injustice.\n\nOur homes in Sai Nagar Bhandup (Mumbai) are under threat due to an illegal and politically influenced demolition. A corrupt builder, Atul Shirodkar, supported by MLA Sunil Raut, has initiated this demolition despite not having clear land titles or fulfilling agreements with original owners. Government agencies like SRA and the police are allegedly ignoring the issue due to political pressure. Prominent activist Anjali Damania is fighting against this injustice, but we need more support to stop the demolition and protect our community.\n\n* The builder lacks clear titles and agreements are unfulfilled.\n* Partial demolitions are creating unsafe conditions.\n* Government agencies and the police are allegedly compromised.\n* Anjali Damania is advocating for us, but we need broader support.\n\nI am feeling really helpless.\n\nIf possible, Please share this story, involve media, and reach out to prominent figures who can help stop this unlawful demolition.

        "No compensation for house owners. It is daylight robbery.\n\nOriginal land owner is cheated too.",

People living there have purchased the property from original owner and been living there since 35-40 years.\n\nBuilder did not pay the land owner the agreed sum of money and effectively bought plot of 18000 sq mt, by paying a meagre 89 lakhs. House owners are kept in dark and did not get any compensation despite being owner. They were never made a party in the agreement. \n\nOriginal owner passed away in 2017 and his family is now going to High Court as well against the builder for not paying agreed sum of money (2 Cr in 2007).\n\nThe reason builder is highlighting this property as slum because he can bypass paying owners and can give very small area in newly built structure (~280 Sqft).\n\nBuilder is exploiting poor people who are not educated and united.
