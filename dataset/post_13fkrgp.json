    "selftext": "\nAs Research Scholars across India celebrate 'Save Research Day' today, I want to bring the attention of r/Indians on some of the institutional mechanisms that I have faced during my Bachelors in Engineering, PhD in Physics and now, post doctoral research, all in top Indian institutes. These mechanisms keep everyone working for research in India at a disadvantage financially, career-wise and eventually emotionally as a result. \n\n\nGovt of India institutionally spends lowest on education as well as GERD (Gross Expenditure on Research and Development) as shown in the graph attached. This translates to poorly educated people in the country, even worse when folks are not educated enough you bet they won't even know about the field of innovation and research. (Oww.. There's something known as fundamental research also?!). Govt has been consistently diluting science books upto 10th and 12th anyway (will provide sources of you ask).  Eventually low number of people in research and low representation in terms of Nobel prize wins or number of people going into research. \n\n\nPersonal experience: \nI was working alone in my PhD project which is mostly true. The talented people after their PhDs would rather go to countries like Israel, Europe or US where they will be working with other PhD students and professors and creating much much better impact and output. For professors in India, this translates to slower growth. \nFor PhD students, it means much more pressure and workload as they have to do everything in the project themselves. For Post-Docs it clearly means being forced to move out of their country and mostly live alone in their 30s at a time when they could rather think of family and kids. \nMind you, these are the most talented people in the country. I myself was a top ranker in the so-called JEE kind of exams. \n\nI'll start my rant with the elephant in the room: salaries.\n\nSalaries: As a post PhD researcher (post-doc) , I don't have health benefits in my university. My salary is 47k, which is 12k more than what I was earning in last 5 years during PhD. \n90% of my colleagues managed to join in foreign universities where they save more than what I earn. To rub salt on injuries they get more respect socially in friend circles, in the marriage market and smtyms even in their own family. \n\nLack of institutional support: \nFor 6 months after my PhD work was finished, I was jobless and earning zero because I hadn't finished writing my thesis yet. The professors want to maintain quality of work and don't care of the time it takes to reach that level of quality. But when it comes to money, although the professors are secure financially (they must have faced worse in their times though), they don't give a damn about the fact that our salaries are going to stop and we won't be earning anything. That's just common in academia now. My friends were sitting at 2 lacs+ in IT so they were kind enough to support me. But even if I had cleared bank PO exam and was a peon in the bank, I would have job security and life security in my late 20s and close to 30. I was (systematic conclusion) a fool to think of doing Research and Development. Btw, this was not a sudden situational crisis I wasn't pre-aware of. It was this situational awareness that caused many of my friends to quit PhD, go abroad for PhD, and one known person from my institute in the situation also did s*****e (Although the real reason can never be known for his s******e, THIS was the situation he was in, salary stopped and writing thesis. He was married. He may have killed himself for some other reason as well. )\n\n\nWhy I didn't go abroad, I ask me even today. I remembered watching the movie in the title of the post. But realised it missed out on a lot.",

You need to look at examples of Korea, Singapore and also, all the developed nations as of today, to know why your argument is wrong.\n\nIf you consider GDP per capita, i.e, how much fraction each individual is paying from his pocket for R&D, your argument will become even more weaker than what this graph is already saying.  \n\n\nIt's not me but govt think tank NITI Ayog and IFC saying this.",

What you are saying seems correct to me. But if you look at it from a societal/individual perspective, the people who are doing a more important work are given less importance. There's a reason that most nobel prizes are won by Jews, that they have consistently given more respect to professions such as research.\n\nIt would become much more complicated question about what fraction of budget should go where. There are enormous corruption involved in every area of govt expenditure as well. That is not the main purpose of my post. It is to highlight that people with bank PO exams are more respected than researchers who are doing much harder work.  I don't want to undermine the importance of job of a bank manager or receptionist. It's just that researchers are asked to sacrifice so much individually, more talented people have to accept lesser job security, that no one is willing to go into research in India and whoever does it is dis-incentivized to remain in India to a huge extent",

I have published 12 SCI papers and have 3 patents to my credit but the industry still said that I lack experience. My project work was sponsored by industry so I dealt with solving an industrially emerging problem and not something abstract. After teaching dozens of B. Techs, M. Techs. and guiding junior PhDs, the company says that we lack experience. This too is after 4 years of engineering, 2 years of M. Tech and nearly 6 years of Ph. D. Now, I have got a job but still feel that I should emigrate to some other country where more value is given to R & D. At the end of the day the same companies hire M. Techs for peanuts and when they aren't able to solve problems come to a consultant ending up paying several lakhs when they could have hired a Ph. D. in the first place who would have guided them and performed research and innovation. I feel that there is no hope for people like us.",
        "Yes, but the current budget distribution of India doesn't benefit the laborors either. I think the most important place a country can spend their money is social safety nets like Healthcare, Education, Pension, etc. India does not do a great job investing in this section. \n\nAnother important sector is investing in R&D. The abysmally low percentage of GDP invested in R&D should be worrying. Even public infrastructure is an important sector but it shouldn't be the reason for R&D to suffer.",
        "Everyone is free to decide the best for themselves. And it's also possible that India doesn't appreciate or need researchers in all fields immediately either. The individuals thus may well be better placed abroad. However, there's a cost aspect to their education that's already incurred and must be then accounted for. \n\nConsidering the state of India's economy, it would be best if there's a conditional moratorium to the kind of subsidised education that is funded by the taxpayer and not private scholarship.\n\nA consecutive period of 3 years within 10 years from date of passing out should be mandatorily served by such graduate in India, whether in public or private sector. Any exceptions would have to pay back the subsidy.\n\nThis would lead to better selections of research fields.",

If enough money was being sent back, it would've been okay, but that's a thing of the yore and too indefinite to ascertain. Most people who go once settle abroad and spend mostly abroad.

The amount of work people put in getting the output and the amount they get paid is just ridiculous. \nThere are many rhetorics given about PhD scholars getting paid less\na) PhDs are students and hence they should be paid less, but then my point is these same people are the ones who research, they are the hands in the labs, infact sincerely even the brains. Profs are mostly old fossils who do admin stuff. \nb) Moreover, in many institutes PhDs do the teaching part too as teaching assistants. In my institute even preparing question papers and checking is the duty of the PhD scholar.\nc) Many people think that PhDs do not do any work, because they sometimes find them not working during work hours. Well research is not like a 9-5 job. There are times when you are awake for days to solve your research problem and there are times when you do not have idea. In most cases if you want to finish PhD with good papers, it is the reverse are mostly overworking than a common 9-5 job person to get your research finished.\n\nAfter all this you get paid 31k-36k (except for a very few PMRF fellows).\n\nThe situation is even worse after PhD when you join for post-doc. Most of the fellowships lie around 40-50k even after enduring the PhD shit for 5 years.

Totally bypassing the Secondary and all the while also having decent R&D (PSU companies, IIT but not limited to it like institutes, MNC's opening up R&D labs in India, creating a surplus of managerial worker, elite educated class in a economy which required low skill labor force at scale).\n\nNo other major country in history has done this (one could argue Singapore did this but that is too unique a case given how tiny it was and more fundamental they didn't even have a choice due to their size, they didn't have enough Primary Sector to spend too much time on it hence had to move onto next stages).\n\nIf India makes it it will be insane achievement since no one has made it like this, even though India would still be (eventually) making inroads into Manufacturing/Secondary Sector but the path to this was not linear but 2 steps forward over-ambitious leap, after long time 1 step back and then 1 step forward again.",

Sure one can still do research in a field of their choice, whether important to anyone or not, but then, just fund it privately. \n\nI know researchers like to be perenially coccooned and automatically tenured, but the real world, or let me say, the real third world, has no place for vanity projects or vague and interminable work with no result. This proposal maps research to reality. It's basic career choice 101 that every individual but a researcher seems to mull over in life. Select fields that pay.\n\nBy the way, I did not restrict the scope of service to govt service alone but an India-based entity. It could be a private university or an NGO or a corporate here. The idea is to at least tax the researcher or get back the subsidy. How well and if at all we can use their intellect fruitfully is a matter or debate. Many in the private sector have student loan obligations that they have to fulfill too, no matter how the job market is. Why should researchers be any different?\n\nAny intellectual property created by researcher abroad is likely to become the intellectual property of the foreign country or corporate overseas. If it's going to funnel back to India later at market rate and EXIM terms anyway, what exactly is its differential advantage?.",

It seems to me like this leap from the primary sector to the tertiary sector is happenstance rather than the government actively trying to do it (I may be wrong, just my hunch).

It has also led to a complete lack of labour protection enforcement, with employees not understanding the importance of labour laws.",

Do you have any quantitative data on this? Do you think research that doesn't have immediate/real-world applications is getting funded out there? Do you think funders/government are idiots? Even very pertinent research is not being funded in this country, so your whole tirade about getting a high ROI is moot. No research is being funded in India, high ROI or not.\n\nAlso, the government already has a panel/committee in all disciplines that decide who gets the grant. There is already a screening for these things. Again, you have no clue how the system works so please educate yourself.",

Similarly UK attained it in 1928, France in 1944 and Switzerland in 1971!\nThe other cohort of developed economies in east Asia were far more authoritarian but way faster in developing. Case in point, South Korea reached current level of income in half the time UK required. \nImportant to remember that as countries developed they democratized as well. China is defying the trend with rapid development without political freedom while India continues to chug along with descending into authoritarianism. Well at least for now.",
        "Quantum computing is the new buzzword. But I guess good work is happening in space start-ups.",
        "Yeah, I'm sorry, but all you did was confirm my doubts about the unemployability of most research grads without patronage, and indeed, their reluctance to subject themselves to market forces here beyond their academic cocoon. \n\nMy original comment was a response to the sense of entitlement of emolument in the post-doc phase. No, you're not entitled to anything once you're a doctorate. You cleared one exam, got a grant, finished your course. You are on your own now. It's like that in every other line. Join the queue. In case the grant came out of government-assistance, the moratorium applies to you, else go on your merry way. It's not difficult to understand. But there can be no guarantees of jobs just like there's no guarantee of campus placements in any other insititution, howsoever renowned. In fact, the incestuous relationship between academia and research must end. Students can't simply be research assistants to their profs. And teaching classes and active researching can be at odds anyway. The very fact that there arent enough jobs available for all our Ph.Ds at the end of the process tells you something about India and tells me something about the individual. It's the bare minimum for applying for a college teaching job here and now. As soon as researchers realise this ground reality, the better. If they want to go beyond academics, the world is their oyster.",
        "Once again a tirade with no real substance. \n\nI'm sorry I cannot have a conversation with an ignoramus like you. But I do commend how confidently incorrect you are, and how you're sticking by your guns. \n\nLet me clear out some misconceptions, no researcher is asking for a free hand out, graduate and post-grad positions are not handed out willy-nilly, they are highly competitive and a strict screening process is applied.\n\nProfessors have TA and RAs because TAship and RAships are paying for the fellowship. \n\nLastly, fundamental research cannot be subjected to the free market because corporates don't fund fundamental research. However, fundamental research provides the building blocks for applied research. You can't build a fucking car without knowing how inertia or momentum works. Not funding R&D is extremely short-sighted, developing country or not. Why the hell do you think USA, Germany, Japan etc. are dishing out grants for fundamental research in many developing countries? You think they are philanthropic and big-hearted? \n\nThis 'we're a poor country' bullshit is an overused trope that is unfounded in facts. The union government has allocated *200 crores* for research in 2023-24. Let that sink in, a measly *200 crores*, the statue of unity cost us 3000 crores to build. And if you really think that a statue has more ROI than fundamental research, then I urge you to get your brain checked.",
        "And I commend you for mastering the art of sophisticated skulduggery. That sense of entitlement you claim isn't the case formed the underpinning of the original poster's comment. Staying with you, while the program may have some ostensible safeguards, many Ph.D degrees are indeed handed out willy-nilly for work that's repetitive, irrelevant or insignificantly accretional, so I have no reason to believe that the jobs following that will not be merely accommodative. It's like how the infamous IIPM was offering in-house teaching placements to their batches who no one else was willing to take on, and claiming 100% placement record as a result. Then that just becomes a ponzi scheme. Funding fundamental research (i.e. research without timelines of deliverables and little accountability) need not be the concern of the market or the state, so the individual has to take more of an onus. Get a job. Experiment on weekends. Scientific invention has predated the education system anyway.\n\nIf developed countries are happy to fund our researchers, I have no problem. But other than that, I want all humanities Ph.D.s to be discontinued and those in sciences to work on this quid-pro-quo model. No free lunches. \n\nAnd where exactly did I recommend diverting research funds into erecting statues? But two wrongs don't make a right. You may well boast of having the highest IQ in the room, but as someone who's probably paid more IT than you, I get to have a say on how our monies get used.",
        "And where the hell are you getting this idea that most research is useless? You obviously don't have data. It's your 'feeling', and your feeling does not mean jack shit.\n\nAgain, since you have zero fucking idea about research works, there is no point in telling you that your imaginary/made-up idea of how fundamental research works is delusional. Fundamental research is without accountability or deliverables? Man I'd really like what you're smoking. Hook me up with your dealer. \n\nYou think you have more say because you pay more taxes? 😂😂 Do you live in the real world or some made up free market paradise that you've concocted?",
        "Right today there are billion dollar corporations of India that are buying business in the west so they can afford to do research but sacrificing short term profitability is what probably holds them back",
        "Research is inherently a risky activity with no guaranteed outcomes. Indian companies are generally risk averse..They want guaranteed output. So you have to move abroad to be able to do any kind of meaningful research ..",
        "It was part happenstance, part compulsion, part accident and everything mixed on.\n\nBy late 80s, India had already missed the action (ramping up of Secondary Sector) that it was supposed to happen by late 60s and certainly by 70s. But since that did not happen and since India had by 80s created enough of managerial class workforce (elite education institutions followed by secondary tier ones), there was enough to make forays into Services like IT.\n\nAnd since margins and investment/capital costs were lower in setting up & scaling of Services it means India saw this as a golden goose, i.e. lots of revenue/profit for little input (which for a poor Govt is magical and they'll chew your hand to get such a deal. Setting up Secondary Sector is massively capital-intensive and requires political will as well. India Govts were too weak, poor and incompetent to take this challenge).\n\n> However, this leap seems to have created an enormous wealth inequality in the country\n\nIndeed. Because Services can not absorb massive working force in short space of time (even though if things are done organically, Manufacturing actually uses less people while Services uses more, but this happens because there is an order and socio-economic condition is such that there are enough people who are consumers and have enough income to sustain the Services sector, for eg. someone who runs a rickshaw or daily wage worker isn't going to be using Food or clothes couriers deliver personals to enough scale).\n\nThis meant a small section who ventured into Services did very well but the bulk could not tap into this and these bulk didn't have alternative either (like Secondary sector). They only had Primary sector, which is why the Labor Force numbers involved in Agri sector in India is so massive, nearly 50% which after 8 decades of independence is ridiculous. \n\n> with only people who have been educated beyond the +2 level being able to get such jobs.\n\nThis sort of thing is what I meant by surplus creation of managerial class. India because it invested into elite Education Institutions (it wasn't just IIT/IIMs alone) early on, over time it was able to create a large enough pool of people who were highly educated and ambitious. A decent chunk of them also kept leaving India (hence the brain drain aspect of this Post).\n\nIndia did not invest enough on Vocational Institutes that would have produced low to mid-level work force (this is what China, massively). India pooled it's money and hope on the Top level of human capital and paid poor attention to mid to low level which would have involved more people.\n\nPart of this was also being poor (easier to produce 1000 highly educated people than do low-mid-level educated workforce of 100,000) but mostly it was political, part ideology and vision and part just being lazy & incompetent.\n\nChina too was similarly poor they did it so India could have as well.",
        "Your defensiveness and being in denial is understandable. You have to understand though that the markers of success for researchers and others are different. While a researcher may hail infinitesmal changes with excessively and indefinitely long-term consequences, if any, as succesful, others may not. So your asking for proof of success in that context is a moot point. The proof is in the pudding. From my experience and presumably from those of people like the ones who upvoted my first comment, it’s always either been government’s direct administrative action, howsoever corrupt, or big corporate drives, howsoever capitalistic, that have bailed people out of seemingly life-or-death situations rather than individuals claiming to work for the greater good of humanity. \n\nNow, I know research people have lots of time on their hand to dwell over the same thing, but I will now return to this topic when I’m sufficiently bored. Suffice to say we’ll never agree on this. But you can keep trying."

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "As Research Scholars across India celebrate 'Save Research Day' today, I want to bring the attention of r/Indians on some of the institutional mechanisms that I have faced during my Bachelors in Engineering, PhD in Physics and now, post doctoral research, all in top Indian institutes. These mechanisms keep everyone working for research in India at a disadvantage financially, career-wise and eventually emotionally as a result. Govt of India institutionally spends lowest on education as well as GERD (Gross Expenditure on Research and Development) as shown in the graph attached. This translates to poorly educated people in the country, even worse when folks are not educated enough you bet they won't even know about the field of innovation and research. (Oww.. There's something known as fundamental research also?!). Govt has been consistently diluting science books upto 10th and 12th anyway (will provide sources of you ask). Eventually low number of people in research and low representation in terms of Nobel prize wins or number of people going into research. Personal experience: I was working alone in my PhD project which is mostly true. The talented people after their PhDs would rather go to countries like Israel, Europe or US where they will be working with other PhD students and professors and creating much much better impact and output. For professors in India, this translates to slower growth. For PhD students, it means much more pressure and workload as they have to do everything in the project themselves. For Post-Docs it clearly means being forced to move out of their country and mostly live alone in their 30s at a time when they could rather think of family and kids. Mind you, these are the most talented people in the country. I myself was a top ranker in the so-called JEE kind of exams. I'll start my rant with the elephant in the room: salaries. Salaries: As a post PhD researcher (post-doc) , I don't have health benefits in my university. My salary is 47k, which is 12k more than what I was earning in last 5 years during PhD. 90% of my colleagues managed to join in foreign universities where they save more than what I earn. To rub salt on injuries they get more respect socially in friend circles, in the marriage market and smtyms even in their own family. Lack of institutional support: For 6 months after my PhD work was finished, I was jobless and earning zero because I hadn't finished writing my thesis yet. The professors want to maintain quality of work and don't care of the time it takes to reach that level of quality. But when it comes to money, although the professors are secure financially (they must have faced worse in their times though), they don't give a damn about the fact that our salaries are going to stop and we won't be earning anything. That's just common in academia now. My friends were sitting at 2 lacs+ in IT so they were kind enough to support me. But even if I had cleared bank PO exam and was a peon in the bank, I would have job security and life security in my late 20s and close to 30. I was (systematic conclusion) a fool to think of doing Research and Development. Btw, this was not a sudden situational crisis I wasn't pre-aware of. It was this situational awareness that caused many of my friends to quit PhD, go abroad for PhD, and one known person from my institute in the situation also did s*****e (Although the real reason can never be known for his s******e, THIS was the situation he was in, salary stopped and writing thesis. He was married. He may have killed himself for some other reason as well. ) Why I didn't go abroad, I ask me even today. I remembered watching the movie in the title of the post. But realised it missed out on a lot.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Image link: Sometimes when you feel useless, know that there is a legend to this chart that adds absolutely nothing. Loved this post. Are you trying to make the typical argument that western media made about why a country with poverty should not launch space missions? Research & development is the thing that leads to 'creation of opportunities' whether it is in terms of jobs or resources.R&D is the only thing that leads to 'expansion of pie' otherwise all you'll end up having in a country is in-fighting for the finite pie. You need to look at examples of Korea, Singapore and also, all the developed nations as of today, to know why your argument is wrong. If you consider GDP per capita, i.e, how much fraction each individual is paying from his pocket for R&D, your argument will become even more weaker than what this graph is already saying. It's not me but govt think tank NITI Ayog and IFC saying this. Good post. I think that the focus right now is on job creation. That's why there is an infra boom happening everywhere. Manufacturing is also a focus but we are mostly into low-tech manufacturing. We need to get into high-tech manufacturing but money is not a luxury right now in India. Most of the unicorns are based on low-cost manual labour. Once we grow our per-capita income and perform well on health & other social indicators, we should invest heavily in high-tech manufacturing. This will eventually show growth in GERD. I want to see what percentage of our taxes go to Election Campaigning. if we fund more in education research and healthcare, the effects should be visible.. else we'll be asking the same question may be after 25 more years. Look at the progress Indians are making in other countries. What you are saying seems correct to me. But if you look at it from a societal/individual perspective, the people who are doing a more important work are given less importance. There's a reason that most nobel prizes are won by Jews, that they have consistently given more respect to professions such as research. It would become much more complicated question about what fraction of budget should go where. There are enormous corruption involved in every area of govt expenditure as well. That is not the main purpose of my post. It is to highlight that people with bank PO exams are more respected than researchers who are doing much harder work. I don't want to undermine the importance of job of a bank manager or receptionist. It's just that researchers are asked to sacrifice so much individually, more talented people have to accept lesser job security, that no one is willing to go into research in India and whoever does it is dis-incentivized to remain in India to a huge extent Yeah, individuals only make decisions based on the force of the surrounding environment. I just didn't pack up my bags and left India because I was *bored*. Nopes. I couldn't survive here without losing whatever mind I am left with. Every trip back is also exhausting. If you put up a bulb in a village, the next village gangster politician will crack your head open. Life is not Bollywood. Even I wanted to pursue research but after seeing the pay, my mind changed. ChatGPT to the rescue, South Korea is a great example as to why government led R&D expenditure and spending on education matters. South Korea's development from a low-income agricultural economy to a high-income, technologically advanced industrialized economy has been a remarkable success story. The key factors that contributed to South Korea's development were Government-led development and Strong education system. Here is the GDP per capita of South Korea since the 1960s, adjusted for inflation using constant 2010 US dollars based on data from the World Bank: * 1960: $1,406 * 1970: $2,459 * 1980: $6,455 * 1990: $11,874 * 2000: $17,189 * 2010: $25,258 * 2020: $31,317 And Gerd is a medical condition I'm in the same boat as you OP. After completing PhD in Material Science from a top University it is even difficult to get a well deserving job. I have published 12 SCI papers and have 3 patents to my credit but the industry still said that I lack experience. My project work was sponsored by industry so I dealt with solving an industrially emerging problem and not something abstract. After teaching dozens of B. Techs, M. Techs. and guiding junior PhDs, the company says that we lack experience. This too is after 4 years of engineering, 2 years of M. Tech and nearly 6 years of Ph. D. Now, I have got a job but still feel that I should emigrate to some other country where more value is given to R & D. At the end of the day the same companies hire M. Techs for peanuts and when they aren't able to solve problems come to a consultant ending up paying several lakhs when they could have hired a Ph. D. in the first place who would have guided them and performed research and innovation. I feel that there is no hope for people like us. Yes, but the current budget distribution of India doesn't benefit the laborors either. I think the most important place a country can spend their money is social safety nets like Healthcare, Education, Pension, etc. India does not do a great job investing in this section. Another important sector is investing in R&D. The abysmally low percentage of GDP invested in R&D should be worrying. Even public infrastructure is an important sector but it shouldn't be the reason for R&D to suffer. Everyone is free to decide the best for themselves. And it's also possible that India doesn't appreciate or need researchers in all fields immediately either. The individuals thus may well be better placed abroad. However, there's a cost aspect to their education that's already incurred and must be then accounted for. Considering the state of India's economy, it would be best if there's a conditional moratorium to the kind of subsidised education that is funded by the taxpayer and not private scholarship. A consecutive period of 3 years within 10 years from date of passing out should be mandatorily served by such graduate in India, whether in public or private sector. Any exceptions would have to pay back the subsidy. This would lead to better selections of research fields. In India, PHDs generally deliver milk cartons and groceries to their professors - so that their dissertation is approved. If you are from the lower caste without any backing, you can be doing much worse. No wonder many budding scientists leave India to pursue research in a country which respects them. I think this could be blamed on HR who don't shit about the post for which they are hiring. Any medico here, GERD Gastroesophageal reflux disease. Not medical, but that's what I immediately thought and confused why is acidity being measured in GDP. Yes, that's also true. I did my masters and PhD in materials science in foreign universities and the sole reason was my btech thesis guide who suggested me to move out for higher studies if I had family support. I did that I had the opportunity to work with the best profs and minds in my field. Currently I work as a post doc, and wherever I talk to friends who are in academia in India they always reflect the same issues as highlighted by OP. It’s sad that our govt does fuk all to support research and educational institutions in the country. I personally want to come back but my field has none or very few jobs. The word settle is very hard in fundamental research and ppl/society hardly understand. With family pressure to come back and my goal to land a permanent position I’ve been all over the place over past year contemplating career choices. Ffs I feel like I have been ‘temporary’ everywhere. Hope the situation changes for ppl like us but doesn’t look like it tbh. Wish you all the best OP Hahaha my thoughts exactly At least learn from israel rather than dick riding them Yeah, the South Korean story is a remarkable example and one of the few cases where Military Rule actually benefitted the economy immensely. Their five-year plans helped them develop an export-oriented economy. In India if you're working on machine or providing any service yourself i.e. some physical work is being done ✅ then and then only you are considered to be doing some work. I work in manufacturing company where even the Unit head, president, VCMD thinks only workers who operates machines are important. Technical, Quality and R&D are the auxiliary departments and of little or no use. WTF has GERD got anything to do with GDP? Israel r&d budget is well spent on very humanitarian projects So, all these r&d department of various institutions and companies produce, close to negligible? Just curious Every where i see, I see reactive people. Ready to start drama or excuse or politics. Rarely seen any creative people talking about something new passionately. Our Rishi’s already did R&D 5000 years ago… Everyone wants to praise this govt. for all the Make in India campaign but you can't have make in India without R&D. We are buying Chinese stuff and repacking it as Make in India, our trade deficit is shouting on top of its lungs indicating this. Brain Drain is there because people like me knows there will never be a govt. that spends money on R&D. Work for a firm where if you have any idea and file for patent it will be filed in via the parent company in U.S and then India. Its owned by the U.S entity. If you look at last 1000 patent filed in U.S majority are co-authored by Indians. Its not that we don't love to do that for our country but there is nothing in it for us as a person. We have to make ends meet and thanks to this govt. everything is taxed 5 times including what I earn and get no benefit. If it's done by the company whose mother company is not based in India, everything is owned by parent company. You get your name on patent/research paper that's it. Paragraph 1 and 3 are at odds with each other. If \"India doesn't appreciate or need researchers in all fields immediately\", how will the government impose a moratorium? In my field (in STEM), there are 1 or 2 vacant positions of scientists in government institutions every year, with the examination process lasting more than a year. Sometime there are no seats for your caste category. What choice do researchers have, but to move abroad? Do you think at some point where government can't fulfill research needs (lack of funds), the private sector should step in. From a private sector/profit perspective, Good research brings innovation and ultimately innovation has a higher profit margin than production. In the graph I am surprised Mexico spends half of India even though it's per capita gdp is almost 5 times higher I laughed so hard HR are paper pushers. Blame the CEOs and the leadership who would rather spend 1 cr on a consultant for 12 months than hire a head count for ever. Particularly one who is so specialized they wouldn’t know how to get best value from them. Swades was released in 2004. Please look at data of 2003 or earlier ! I've suggested a 10-year period within which the 3-year India tenure must be served. That catch-up period would most likely help align individual expertise with local market requirement since many thing that start in developed countries eventually find footing and traction in other nations. However, if it's still not the case, then either the candidate has to find and work in the next-most similar field in India where there is a vacancy or pay back the subsidy because that would indicate with some likelihood that the research was done in a useless sphere. As a nation,we're simply not rich enough to take large bets on something of no value to us (granted, pun unintended, this is not the only field where we should cut costs though; I'm against OROP and zero-tax agricultural income as well). If enough money was being sent back, it would've been okay, but that's a thing of the yore and too indefinite to ascertain. Most people who go once settle abroad and spend mostly abroad. What they send back to their kin in India is insignificant in monetary terms, so it may be ignored. You have the draft in the military in many countries. Consider the requirement as the intellectual draft. Do it once and then do your thing. We have to stop using taxpayers money to fuel shortcuts to immigration. Assuming the points about positions you made about your job are facts, it suggests you knew your chances of working in India were slim and going abroad were semi-decent. You still made your choice. We should make ours. All of them. Indian PMO literally lobbies US, UK are equivalent level (meaning President & PM level) to get more Visas for Indian's to move abroad with the intent to get Remmitances. This makes sense IF it's a short term strategy to get money so that it can be invested domestically and there is pressure release in domestic market at the same time to absorb other workers. But this has lasted for nearly half a century. This has become systemic and locked in. So the brain drain is not Individual led, it's State led. It is Indian State which is creating & sustaining an environment that facilitates it. Besides even in short term it is Always the State that is responsible for Brain Drain. This is how it happened in China. Nothing till mid to late 80s and then by early 00s they finally matched Indian numbers, despite India doing this for decades longer. The State opened the valve, meaning even if Individuals want to they can't part take in this brain drain IF the State is not complicit. State is the prerequisite entity here. On R&D, currently it's gone a bit lower but in reality really, given India's stage of development it for decades was higher than one would expect from a country in India's situation. India seems to be a unique outlier in world history that has chosen the path of, Primary Sector (half-baked itself) to Tertiary Sector + R&D development path. No major sovereign country in human history has done it like this (barring maybe tiny island or city states or client states). Not all States that have Authotarian Spectrum (it is a matter of degrees like Democracy also has varieties/degrees across different countries, etc) Governance Systems make it. However, Every single State that made it (became globe level rich, developed status wholly under 1 system, etc) did so under Authotarian Spectrum Governance System. There are no exceptions. NONE. Which is very bizarre since social science usually doesn't do Absolutes. India IF it makes it will become the first country in human history to break this paradigm. Yet even then it will just become an exception to the rule, i.e. this paradigm remains regardless. I don't know about other countries but a substantially large number of PhDs in India are a mockery of R&D. I don't think things were any better 20 years back. You do realize that we have spent thousands of crores on useless statues, thousands of crores on vanity projects, thousands of crores on jumbo jets to ferry the narcissist everywhere so that NRI's can welcome and get a nationalistic orgasm? When all the money goes to corruption and social schemes, where is the money left? Can you please elaborate? What about the US. They made it, and they don't have an Authoritarian Spectrum Governance system. I agree we are sorely lacking in this area and it needs an urgent fix. Political parties of all hues need to waste less on useless SOPs and freebies and invest in arenas that have tangible long term benefits. Unfortunately long sightedness doesn't reap electoral benefits That is so sad. By the time US was developed half the population couldn't even vote, i.e. Women. As matter of objective fact, Republic of India is an Older \"TRUE\" Democracy than US given that US got Real on-ground Universal Suffrage post mid 1960s, by which point India had conducted nearly dozen National+State election. In late 18th and early 19th century the so called Voting population of US was 5-15%. And when Blacks did get the vote representation in law (which is different to on-ground) for a while they were counted as 3/5 of a human. The US State was immensely powerful on core aspects (just because things like education, local body leaders, policing, etc exist doesn't change that. Even China has this. General Secretary of CPC isn't literally involved in day to day of some Tier 10 village). Even Switerzland didn't have Universal Suffrage till early 70s. They had achieved developed status by 1890s. If you're given a decent lifestyle here itself, many people would rather ignore the high pay in other countries given that their emotional well-being is better close to their family. But reality is rather the opposite. You're punished for staying here I see your point. Thanks for the explanation. OP I have seen both sides for a brief time... I too was among all India's top rankers in my field. I remember when I completed my M.Sc. a well-known personality if our field offered me a scholarship to pursue studies in the US. I declined and said that I want to serve the country. He smiled and we lost him 2 years back in covid. I did my PhD here and almost went into depression seeing the practices here. I still think that I wasn't able to work per my capabilities as I was starved of basic research facilities I got to visit a UK institute for a few months and saw the real difference in infrastructure. Right now I have a so-called permanent position in a public research institute. But trust me... It is really difficult to work here. We have to plan experiments as per the limited facilities available and whatnot... My suggestion would be to go outside, explore the world, and return to India for doing applied work... as it will be helpful to society here. For basic sciences, it is better if one goes and stays outside. My father went abroad for his graduate studies but he was an editor for the Indian Journal in his field for decades. He wanted to encourage and mentor local talent, as he knew how hard it was to get funding or even published. Our people can do anything, but scientific research is the foundation of long term economic prosperity. A country can’t rely on being the world’s factory or R&D centre forever. HR don't have the authority to set up r&d wings. Indian companies simply don't have the stomach to invest in r&d long term because it's not something with guaranteed returns. They're just lazy and just want to get the tech by buying or acquiring You exactly said the right thing. 1) The entire burden of PhD is on student. I can count the number of times I discussed my research with my supervisor in this entire PhD. I am about to finish mine. If my supervisor is asked what my work is, I am pretty sure he will fumble. 2) The funding is fucked up. The amount of work people put in getting the output and the amount they get paid is just ridiculous. There are many rhetorics given about PhD scholars getting paid less a) PhDs are students and hence they should be paid less, but then my point is these same people are the ones who research, they are the hands in the labs, infact sincerely even the brains. Profs are mostly old fossils who do admin stuff. b) Moreover, in many institutes PhDs do the teaching part too as teaching assistants. In my institute even preparing question papers and checking is the duty of the PhD scholar. c) Many people think that PhDs do not do any work, because they sometimes find them not working during work hours. Well research is not like a 9-5 job. There are times when you are awake for days to solve your research problem and there are times when you do not have idea. In most cases if you want to finish PhD with good papers, it is the reverse are mostly overworking than a common 9-5 job person to get your research finished. After all this you get paid 31k-36k (except for a very few PMRF fellows). The situation is even worse after PhD when you join for post-doc. Most of the fellowships lie around 40-50k even after enduring the PhD shit for 5 years. I am mostly going to join industry if I don't get Post-doc abroad, fucked up research system we have. I guess priorities of Indian society are most tiktokers and celebrities. Very true. In terms of quantum computing, I have been involved with some companies in India. Everyone wants just easy results without any investment. I have mostly taken a sabbatical from them for now and will apply abroad for research position. Nah they have money to spend on shit projects like AYUSH and other quackery. Usually government has larger capacity to spend in R&D then private companies. Though companies can reduce govt spending in some areas where industry can have profit. Out of 0.65% a substantial chunk is going to development of psuedosciences. I will argue this is not the full picture. Taxation is fucked in India, like absolutely fucked, ratio of govt spending to GDP is definitely lower compared to other countries, so when there is less to spend, ofcourse less will be spent. A better picture will be percentage spent on RnD from total govt spending. It is still probably going to be little, but not this much. I didn't understand the outlier bit, can you expand on that a bit more if possible? Ah yes, not only do you sacrifice your monetary and job security, but also serve a mandatory service to the government. Why all this? Because you want to contribute to the progress of this country by conducting research. What a great incentive! Sounds like a dream. Usual mainstream understood path of development for a State/Country/Economy was/is, first sort out the Primary Sector (Agriculture), then move onto Secondary Sector (Industrialization, Manufacturing, Infrastructure scaling) and then few years again go by and by now enough of the population has gone through a cycle which will produce enough Educated people to be consumers and also those requiring Services which then leads to exploding of Tertiary Sector (Services). India went from Primary (green revolution & all) to Services (late 80s and 90s ramping up of IT, BPO, etc). Totally bypassing the Secondary and all the while also having decent R&D (PSU companies, IIT but not limited to it like institutes, MNC's opening up R&D labs in India, creating a surplus of managerial worker, elite educated class in a economy which required low skill labor force at scale). No other major country in history has done this (one could argue Singapore did this but that is too unique a case given how tiny it was and more fundamental they didn't even have a choice due to their size, they didn't have enough Primary Sector to spend too much time on it hence had to move onto next stages). If India makes it it will be insane achievement since no one has made it like this, even though India would still be (eventually) making inroads into Manufacturing/Secondary Sector but the path to this was not linear but 2 steps forward over-ambitious leap, after long time 1 step back and then 1 step forward again. You clearly don't understand how R&D works. Which is how it goes back into their pockets. What did this country do for you :( And I could flip the coin and say that not only do the researchers want subsidised education in India, they want guaranteed jobs here too. Sounds like a dream... for them. The nation shouldn't encourage your unsolicited sacrifice. However, it must check its ROI for emoluments and entitlement in its own interest. Sure one can still do research in a field of their choice, whether important to anyone or not, but then, just fund it privately. I know researchers like to be perenially coccooned and automatically tenured, but the real world, or let me say, the real third world, has no place for vanity projects or vague and interminable work with no result. This proposal maps research to reality. It's basic career choice 101 that every individual but a researcher seems to mull over in life. Select fields that pay. By the way, I did not restrict the scope of service to govt service alone but an India-based entity. It could be a private university or an NGO or a corporate here. The idea is to at least tax the researcher or get back the subsidy. How well and if at all we can use their intellect fruitfully is a matter or debate. Many in the private sector have student loan obligations that they have to fulfill too, no matter how the job market is. Why should researchers be any different? Any intellectual property created by researcher abroad is likely to become the intellectual property of the foreign country or corporate overseas. If it's going to funnel back to India later at market rate and EXIM terms anyway, what exactly is its differential advantage?. You clearly don't understand how the real third world should work. Ah thanks for that. It seems to me like this leap from the primary sector to the tertiary sector is happenstance rather than the government actively trying to do it (I may be wrong, just my hunch). However, this leap seems to have created an enormous wealth inequality in the country, with only people who have been educated beyond the +2 level being able to get such jobs. It has also led to a complete lack of labour protection enforcement, with employees not understanding the importance of labour laws. Yeah I'm sorry, you have absolutely no idea about how research works in India or abroad, you're just talking out of your ass. Where are these researchers who're getting subsidised education? I really want to know. PhD is not 'subsidized' education, it's paid-labour. You're also making assumptions that most researchers are doing useless research, where exactly is this coming from? Do you have any quantitative data on this? Do you think research that doesn't have immediate/real-world applications is getting funded out there? Do you think funders/government are idiots? Even very pertinent research is not being funded in this country, so your whole tirade about getting a high ROI is moot. No research is being funded in India, high ROI or not. Also, the government already has a panel/committee in all disciplines that decide who gets the grant. There is already a screening for these things. Again, you have no clue how the system works so please educate yourself. Thanks for this 👍 par mai vote to mandir masjid, communalism, akhand bharat k naam pe daalunga. Blaming anyone else except ourselves living in a democracy is a lie that we make just to feel better. Just asking to know a lil bit more. I am also going to do PhD. What is your university and the domain that you're working? Not the OP. But he makes a fantastic point. Remember India democratized before it developed and its development story is a unique case in world history. On to your point about the US. Voting was far restricted in the US throughout the 19th century when it was rapidly industrializing. It attained universal suffrage only in 1920. Similarly UK attained it in 1928, France in 1944 and Switzerland in 1971! The other cohort of developed economies in east Asia were far more authoritarian but way faster in developing. Case in point, South Korea reached current level of income in half the time UK required. Important to remember that as countries developed they democratized as well. China is defying the trend with rapid development without political freedom while India continues to chug along with descending into authoritarianism. Well at least for now. Quantum computing is the new buzzword. But I guess good work is happening in space start-ups. Yeah, I'm sorry, but all you did was confirm my doubts about the unemployability of most research grads without patronage, and indeed, their reluctance to subject themselves to market forces here beyond their academic cocoon. My original comment was a response to the sense of entitlement of emolument in the post-doc phase. No, you're not entitled to anything once you're a doctorate. You cleared one exam, got a grant, finished your course. You are on your own now. It's like that in every other line. Join the queue. In case the grant came out of government-assistance, the moratorium applies to you, else go on your merry way. It's not difficult to understand. But there can be no guarantees of jobs just like there's no guarantee of campus placements in any other insititution, howsoever renowned. In fact, the incestuous relationship between academia and research must end. Students can't simply be research assistants to their profs. And teaching classes and active researching can be at odds anyway. The very fact that there arent enough jobs available for all our Ph.Ds at the end of the process tells you something about India and tells me something about the individual. It's the bare minimum for applying for a college teaching job here and now. As soon as researchers realise this ground reality, the better. If they want to go beyond academics, the world is their oyster. Once again a tirade with no real substance. I'm sorry I cannot have a conversation with an ignoramus like you. But I do commend how confidently incorrect you are, and how you're sticking by your guns. Let me clear out some misconceptions, no researcher is asking for a free hand out, graduate and post-grad positions are not handed out willy-nilly, they are highly competitive and a strict screening process is applied. Professors have TA and RAs because TAship and RAships are paying for the fellowship. Lastly, fundamental research cannot be subjected to the free market because corporates don't fund fundamental research. However, fundamental research provides the building blocks for applied research. You can't build a fucking car without knowing how inertia or momentum works. Not funding R&D is extremely short-sighted, developing country or not. Why the hell do you think USA, Germany, Japan etc. are dishing out grants for fundamental research in many developing countries? You think they are philanthropic and big-hearted? This 'we're a poor country' bullshit is an overused trope that is unfounded in facts. The union government has allocated *200 crores* for research in 2023-24. Let that sink in, a measly *200 crores*, the statue of unity cost us 3000 crores to build. And if you really think that a statue has more ROI than fundamental research, then I urge you to get your brain checked. And I commend you for mastering the art of sophisticated skulduggery. That sense of entitlement you claim isn't the case formed the underpinning of the original poster's comment. Staying with you, while the program may have some ostensible safeguards, many Ph.D degrees are indeed handed out willy-nilly for work that's repetitive, irrelevant or insignificantly accretional, so I have no reason to believe that the jobs following that will not be merely accommodative. It's like how the infamous IIPM was offering in-house teaching placements to their batches who no one else was willing to take on, and claiming 100% placement record as a result. Then that just becomes a ponzi scheme. Funding fundamental research (i.e. research without timelines of deliverables and little accountability) need not be the concern of the market or the state, so the individual has to take more of an onus. Get a job. Experiment on weekends. Scientific invention has predated the education system anyway. If developed countries are happy to fund our researchers, I have no problem. But other than that, I want all humanities Ph.D.s to be discontinued and those in sciences to work on this quid-pro-quo model. No free lunches. And where exactly did I recommend diverting research funds into erecting statues? But two wrongs don't make a right. You may well boast of having the highest IQ in the room, but as someone who's probably paid more IT than you, I get to have a say on how our monies get used. And where the hell are you getting this idea that most research is useless? You obviously don't have data. It's your 'feeling', and your feeling does not mean jack shit. Again, since you have zero fucking idea about research works, there is no point in telling you that your imaginary/made-up idea of how fundamental research works is delusional. Fundamental research is without accountability or deliverables? Man I'd really like what you're smoking. Hook me up with your dealer. You think you have more say because you pay more taxes? 😂😂 Do you live in the real world or some made up free market paradise that you've concocted? Right today there are billion dollar corporations of India that are buying business in the west so they can afford to do research but sacrificing short term profitability is what probably holds them back Research is inherently a risky activity with no guaranteed outcomes. Indian companies are generally risk averse..They want guaranteed output. So you have to move abroad to be able to do any kind of meaningful research .. It was part happenstance, part compulsion, part accident and everything mixed on. By late 80s, India had already missed the action (ramping up of Secondary Sector) that it was supposed to happen by late 60s and certainly by 70s. But since that did not happen and since India had by 80s created enough of managerial class workforce (elite education institutions followed by secondary tier ones), there was enough to make forays into Services like IT. And since margins and investment/capital costs were lower in setting up & scaling of Services it means India saw this as a golden goose, i.e. lots of revenue/profit for little input (which for a poor Govt is magical and they'll chew your hand to get such a deal. Setting up Secondary Sector is massively capital-intensive and requires political will as well. India Govts were too weak, poor and incompetent to take this challenge). > However, this leap seems to have created an enormous wealth inequality in the country Indeed. Because Services can not absorb massive working force in short space of time (even though if things are done organically, Manufacturing actually uses less people while Services uses more, but this happens because there is an order and socio-economic condition is such that there are enough people who are consumers and have enough income to sustain the Services sector, for eg. someone who runs a rickshaw or daily wage worker isn't going to be using Food or clothes couriers deliver personals to enough scale). This meant a small section who ventured into Services did very well but the bulk could not tap into this and these bulk didn't have alternative either (like Secondary sector). They only had Primary sector, which is why the Labor Force numbers involved in Agri sector in India is so massive, nearly 50% which after 8 decades of independence is ridiculous. > with only people who have been educated beyond the +2 level being able to get such jobs. This sort of thing is what I meant by surplus creation of managerial class. India because it invested into elite Education Institutions (it wasn't just IIT/IIMs alone) early on, over time it was able to create a large enough pool of people who were highly educated and ambitious. A decent chunk of them also kept leaving India (hence the brain drain aspect of this Post). India did not invest enough on Vocational Institutes that would have produced low to mid-level work force (this is what China, massively). India pooled it's money and hope on the Top level of human capital and paid poor attention to mid to low level which would have involved more people. Part of this was also being poor (easier to produce 1000 highly educated people than do low-mid-level educated workforce of 100,000) but mostly it was political, part ideology and vision and part just being lazy & incompetent. China too was similarly poor they did it so India could have as well. Your defensiveness and being in denial is understandable. You have to understand though that the markers of success for researchers and others are different. While a researcher may hail infinitesmal changes with excessively and indefinitely long-term consequences, if any, as succesful, others may not. So your asking for proof of success in that context is a moot point. The proof is in the pudding. From my experience and presumably from those of people like the ones who upvoted my first comment, it’s always either been government’s direct administrative action, howsoever corrupt, or big corporate drives, howsoever capitalistic, that have bailed people out of seemingly life-or-death situations rather than individuals claiming to work for the greater good of humanity. Now, I know research people have lots of time on their hand to dwell over the same thing, but I will now return to this topic when I’m sufficiently bored. Suffice to say we’ll never agree on this. But you can keep trying."
