All they care about is power & more power and this is true for just about everyone of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am more interested in the things that concern me and individuals like me, For Example this case of an unfortunate victim dying of rabies even after completing their vaccine course \n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-woman-dies-of-rabies-despite-completing-vaccine-course/articleshow/108250633.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-woman-dies-of-rabies-despite-completing-vaccine-course/articleshow/108250633.cms)\n\njust horrifies me to the core and I would like to be more aware about more cases like this because it's related to my personal safety and also wellbeing of others, I am quite shocked that no one bats an eyelid on this, I mean rabies is a disease with 99.99% kill rate, once you get bit your only chance of survival is getting the vaccine on time and now in a case like this the vaccine doesn't work so what option do we have left ? do we even realize how cheap life in India can be ?\n\nWhy are the news media not talking about this ? Did the doctor didn't know how to properly administrate and vaccinate or was there something wrong with the vaccine itself ?\n\nWe all know how many dogs & monkeys we encounter in our daily lives and suppose one of them bites you, you go the hospital, pay for the vaccines, get your full course done but still somehow get infected with rabies, you know what that means ? that means you are DONE FOR !!!! It's like a nightmare coming true.\n\nSo please don't tell me or bombard me with what your favourite politician has to say on primetime news because I am not interested in any of that nonsense\n\nI am more interested in what affects my present & my future and I know not a single politician cares about it.",
