    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I am a victim of a financial fraud that is growing in India these days. The greed to get quick rich made me fall into a pit from where it is never coming back. The name of the scam is called [PCM](https://www.pcmests.com/). It works by asked you to recharge on their app and by products. These products give you income each day. Say you buy a product worth Rs. 3500 and your per day income is Rs. 175 for the next 52 days. So it will result in around 2.5X profit. But they will not let you complete that 52 days. They will just remove you one day randomly. The mentor that was talking to you everyday will just stop seeing your text, then you can go on calling them or do anything there is nothing that can be done. They also give bonuses on bring in new members. When they remove you they will also remove all your members so that no one can question your removal or anything. Best part is their whatsapp numbers aren't even Indian, it's some fake UK (+44) number. I'm a student and it's devastating for me. I lost more than 7 thousand rupees in this scam.\n\nPlease I request everyone to be aware of it and don't fall into such potholes. This fraud specially Focuses on students or old age people like our parents. Please stay aware and keep others aware.",
