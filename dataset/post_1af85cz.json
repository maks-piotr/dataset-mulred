    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Some numbers here - China stood at around $3 trillion economy in 2007 and doubled it to $6 trillion by 2010. That's around 4 years time. India today is a $3.8 trillion economy and $7 trillion by 2030 means 6 years time! But what does this growth mean for the common man and how sustainable is this growth without large investment in R&D and manufacturing? Make In India is only working in certain sectors and, in terms of Defence, where most of the R&D is involved from where the tech would trickle down to other sectors, there isn't much investment for homegrown tech. There are hundreds of questions, the government needs to address! [Also this!](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-to-become-third-largest-economy-with-gdp-of-5-trillion-in-three-years-finance-ministry/article67788662.ece/amp/)",

Why stop bhakths from Orgasming! Is this a target? That would mean real growth under 5%. &#x200B; Remember, we were also supposed to be $5Trillion by 2024, but HDI has flattened since 2014 and we're not there yet for some reason, even tho mudi ji has been banging thalis and screaming \"achhe din aagaye, bhai log develop ho gaye\" since 10 years....

And it's not because of the virus of unknown origins. Baar baar jhooth bolo! There should be study about how much is growth / betterment in inflation/ruppee depreciation adjuestd incomes and wealth and also living conditions/quality of life for bottom 50% and bottom 51%- 90% people in income as well as wealth pyramid. Income is not great parameter here as persons income may be higher even with low amount of immovable or movble wealth. Hence any study on so called 'Growth' should not be just based on GDP growth or per capita income growth (even though it is inflation adjusted, PPP terms or constant rupee terms) But it should be based on how much Wealth increase in bottom 50% people and bottom 51%-90% in wealth pyramid gained in given period of time. It requires thorough survey of individual as well as household wealth (immovable and movable) We would need a steady 11% growth to achieve the 7T goal by 2030, which is unprecedented.

Kaun sa analyst hai re baba? McKinsey wala summer intern? This was absolutely hilarious 😂 It’s almost as if we didn’t have 6.8 (17), 6.5 (18), 3.5(19) GDP growth rate. They were facing a declining growth rate. Needing a 7% annualised rate post 2019 to get to 4 trillion by 2024. Covid or not. It wasn’t very likely. Yeah but not with you incharge. Hmm we sit at $3.42 trillion in 2022. $7 trillion is what 2.046x 2022 GDP. So to get to 7 trillion that’s an annualised growth rate of 9.36%. Since 1979 we have touched 9% real gdp growth the following years 1975- 9.1%, 1988 (9.6%), 2021 (9.1%) Mind u these are real GDP not nominal. So this goal sounds a little far fetched. If they mean nominal gdp. Sure they can reach it. Just add some inflation huhuhu To everyone saying how this is bullshit: this news is not for you. This is just copium for bhakts to keep them high on modi's farts. Example: Don't forget inflation and Republic of Foolish Listeners. It's a dream. \"To aspire is free , To achieve it takes hard work.\" Akhand Milky Way🟧🟧 ....But for that Onion has to be rs 300per kg And petrol rs 400 per liter And BJP can aspire to have a Muslim as a PM candidate by 2300 I mean technical Milk and Cow and kinda related, it's our eventual destiny Even Judiciary is of TED speakers. and i can aspire to become a trillionaire Actually I aspire to have today's dinner at Moon.. 🌝 Why is everybody here so quick to be negative? Nirmala looks like a confused aunty who's just been given a high position and is trying to justify it Hmm... exactly what I was thinking. Everyone here seem to be hating without talking facts. Even if India become a $7 Trillion economy, what is the use if only the rich (cronies) become richer and majority of people remain poor? A much better aspiration would be that **atleast 50% of population has income in excess of 1/2 of EWS limit**. This will at least address the poverty issues that we have. Why remain at Deepika Padukone? If it's imaginary then go further and beyond. You can get my vote, if you can reach $7 trillion by next 2 months, which should have already happened, but govt and chaddis priorities were something else. Why they always talk about total gdp and never about per capita gdp?🤔 Pandemic just expediated demonitisation blunder. It was inevitable. The shitshow that is happening now just happened few years early because of pandemic. If there is anything impresive the govt is doing, it is holding of a storm of inevitable inflation till the upcomming election. Don't get into Maths, maths never helped Einstein invent Gravity inflation argument is typically used for countries with pegged currencies. The rupee is floating Why stop at 7. Mai bolta hu pachaas laaaakh!! Of which Adani would have 6 Trillion dollars and the rest of India 1 Trillion I aspire to marry Sydney Sweeney by 2030 Yes. Apple did. And we have Mangoes We use different measures like HDI and multi dimensional poverry index for that they all include per capita income as a sub indicators ,so seems to be what you're looking for Nope. These doesn't capture completely the wealth aspect. Read that the Indian GDP Doubling Rate is 7-8 years...Chinese at their peak had it for around 3-4 years...shows how far behind we are.... Isn’t all fiat floating? India does have the largest working age population in the world. \\> Upper castes &#x200B; In Sajjan ko kya pareshani hai???? Pipe dream Google difference between nominal and real GDP growth. India actually grows at more than 11% nominally on average. It is not at all unprecedented. By that rationale, India's GDP is already 13 trillion. What does she mean that it will reduce to 7 trillion by 2030? Just like every college pass out is becoming a startup founder That’s how the economy grows you simpleton. If \\_we\\_ fail (most likely we will), it is on us. Govt is all clean. Yeah yeah, where salary increments at 4% and essential commodities increment at 20% YoY basis. You're considering the absolute values of nominal GDP. And using real GDP growth. Bravo 👏 👏 We can, if adani acquires more stuff Saat crore. Let's also not forget that 6 trillion in 2010 was worth much much more than what 7 trillion would be in 2030 ... No that's how shareholder value grows. It's funny how they report record profits but wages stay the same as ever. Exploitation 101. Kitna negative he tu bhai, most likely we will kya ? Hoge hum bilkul hoge aisa bol. It's certainly doable. India will reach $4 trillion this year and nominal GDP will probably grow in the 10-11% range. The big question is the value of the rupee. If it is fairly stable then no problem. If not, then it will take longer. Lol My bad G had opened world bank website on phone. Updated the same. Only makes it worse 💀 All GDP values are nominal. Educate yourself Nominal growth rate last Financial year was more than 16%. So what FM is saying is not a crazy prediction. It is most likely the reality. What's funny is OP isn't raising the question of whether the FM is right, but if growth is going to be equitable, which is a more productive question to discuss. Whereas r/India being r/India people are busy being biased. What happened to the era when we would shit on all political parties equally and not be so polarized? Gotcha she is saying nominal gdp. Anyone comparing nominal gdp is just wrong. It’s a worse metric than real gdp. My calc used real GDP values + real gdp growth. Base year being 2015. Based on ur input updating ending value below If I take the 7 trillion as nominal. That is ~5.42 real. A real annualised gdp growth rate of ~8% is required to match the same still high unlikely. Still highly unlikely unless you are assuming high inflation coming in which I doubt is the case with such high interest rates. Unless say a 1980s American recession like scenario. Ps: Try to be a little less belligerent might help you irl. Good day bud. I can also “Aspire” to buy a BMW this year. I 100% agree on this man. Did they name it a new kaal or something ? Gotcha buddy, I accept your feedback India will get rich. But not everyone in India will get rich. Development will impact different sectors differently. Aspire being the keyword here So what do you want them to do, build the entire thing from scratch here? Does an assembly plant not employ people, or contribute to GDP? Hasn't the govt also released a subsidy for fab manufacturing? Will we be facing demonetization effects in 2050 as well? What shit show is happening now? Negative? This would require an annual real GDP growth of >11% for the next 6 years. India's GDP growth was 3.9% in 2019 (World Bank data). And if your memory is not that great, that was pre Covid. Maybe the economy has recovered. But unwilling to entertain the statement that India's economy may grow at a hitherto unheard sustained growth of 11% yoy is not being negative. It's just not being an idiot. and Raghuram Rajan came out saying that kind of subsidy is a stupid one because it is about 1/3 of our entire education spend on a fab that is non critical[RAM fab not processors] and is not going to contribute to the jobs created proportionally[he says the Fab will create 5k jobs] if we spend on bettering our education system and upskilling our workers YOu know how the spending on education has been going down under the modi govt look the result of the ASER report to see the condition of rural education I am against subsidies to multinational corporations who are anyways going to go out of china because of America-China tensions,its the give a man a fish teach a man fishing proverb the money given to multinationals corporations to pretend we are vishwaguru now for \"manufacturing\" iphones is better spent on educating and upskilling our youth So current generation should suffer till 2050 ? I have to wait till 2050 to have proper roads, healthcare, development ? Roads are being built faster than ever before, healthcare has got a shot in the arm with govt medical insurance, literally we're on a growth track, so development is happening. They've put more % of GDP on infra growth than previous govts, they're building roads faster than ever before, more trains are added, Vande Bharat is live. Reality and facts means being negative,? Even per capita income isn't a real indicator as most of the benefits of growth is concentrated in the hands of the Ambanis and Adanis. *Indians will get old faster than they get rich* Regional Development karna nahi hai, aur 7 trillion banenge I can also \"aspire\" to reach $7 Trillion in net worth by 2030. Retire kro ise You can make the case for either side. Its not black and white who is right. Both are gambles. Covid kind of pushed govt in one direction cuz India (and everyone else) is still highly dependent on China for manufactured goods. Our biggest chunk of imports comes from there (15-20%). So there is a big and real risk if they raise prices or threaten supply shutdowns etc for chaos to ensue. Take a look at the number **GoI has offered a 50% subsidy for silicon fabs**. As part of its production-linked incentives (PLI), it has **proposed a support package of $10 billion** **Fabs are enormously costly, create few direct jobs and are being increasingly automated.** They can easily turn into white elephants requiring expensive rescues. **A 50% subsidy for Vedanta will amount to $10 billion (₹80,000 crore), exceeding the entire central allocation for MGNREGA this year (₹73,000 crore). P**riorities, anybody? **India has no comparative advantage in fabs**, which is why a 50% subsidy is required. **But India is competitive in chip design, which also yields more jobs.** **The most vociferous opponent of the government's policy is former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan.** He worries about the entire PLI scheme, especially the subsidies for fabs. **They have offered to provide free land and freebies on top of central subsidies, thinking that a huge downstream industry will come up around the silicon fab.** **This does not follow.** Globally, some plants are fully integrated [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/are-subsidies-for-silicon-fabrication-plants-liable-to-be-wasteful-revadis/articleshow/94335381.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/are-subsidies-for-silicon-fabrication-plants-liable-to-be-wasteful-revadis/articleshow/94335381.cms) these are vanity projects like the bullet train from Ahemdabad to Mumbai the cost of these projects when many indians die of rail accidents are not just immoral but perverse and irresponsible to the future economic health of this republic any one can see that chip manufacturing is largely automated so the jobs created from this fab does not justify the subsidy we are giving Open your eyes people this is bad economic policy !!!! what the washing powder nirma modeling is this? Aabe by 2024 jo promise kia tha uska kya hua? I know, but at least that shows where the country stands with respect to other countries (not at number 5, but somewhere around 150). They always scream about India’s gdp being in the top 5, which gives lay people the impression that India is among top 5 richest countries.. The world is too complex. Which ever path India takes there will be issues. We have seen what happened to GDP during covid. Just talk to anyone who runs a business. All this 50-80K Cr is small potatoes compared to drop in GDP when imports of goods and oil from abroad got hit. It took a long time to recover from it. So there is need for a strategy that reduces that dependence on others. And since we are not super rich like the west, when we pick one path it comes at the cost of another. Rajan is Economic advisor to TN Govt. They are doing a good job attracting manufacturers. Lot of new factories have been set up .But check what method TN is using to attract Manufacturers. Its pretty much similar - special economic zones, lower taxes, subsidizing infra, free land, relaxing labour laws etc etc. Also check how debt level of TN has increased to fund all this. Its not like Rajan is giving TN govt different advice. He is telling them also to invest more in Edu. They invest a lot but they haven't produced an IIT level institute because they have to scatter limited funds across so many districts. Complex problems will always be solved this way. There is no simple, straight forward easy path. I am not a BJP supporter but this issue is not the biggest issue I have with them. All positives about India are shown in absolute numbers to create an illusion of progress. Even if we reach 10 trillion, we still wont be anywhere near the top in GDP per capita. I can aspire to become trillionare too Not really. That’s in real gdp growth. Nominal gdp growth is 10% this year and is what the above measures are based on Here’s a more obvious example: China grew 8% in 2021 but its economy jumped from 14 trillion to 17 trillion which is 20% growth You’re saying that china doubled in 4 years with 10% growth. There is no God given right that India will also follow the same pace or even close to it. 7% seems good for now but ignores the slowdown of 3% in 2019 as well as covid as well as the economy decelerating as nominal growth has heavily declined (real gdp seems up for now) No facts given There’s a lot of pride in becoming third economy but the difference between 2nd China is more than 5x of India As long as we don't have a good manufacturing sector, this GDP growth won't translate to jobs. The elasticity of labour for India from 2011 to 2019 is 0.04, which basically indicates jobless growth. This has been since UPA1 times, and is being continued in Modi's regime. Service sector alone cannot support India's growing number of job seekers. While infratech takes care of unskilled workers, most skilled ones are either relegated to low paying desk jobs or are in agriculture. This is alarming for a growing nation like India, since we run into a real possibility that this demographic will grow old without any savings or pension, and become a serious burden on the upcoming generations. Affluent states tackle this problem by introducing freebies and subsidies. This is just a bandaid on a much deeper wound and is not sustainable Lowda 2024 - 5 trillion target Did we achieve? The way it is worded, she may have been talking about nominal figure. Which is very disingenuous and coming from an economist - stupid. What you are saying is real gdp growth. Nominal gdp growth is different and is the measure which is used to compare economies. Real gdp growth might be more accurate but he is talking about nominal. I can give an example of another economy China. It's gdp was 14.6 trillion in 2020. It had 8.1% growth which should have lead it to 15.826 in real gdp terms. However when accounting for nominal it reached 17.7 trillion which is a 20%+ growth Real, nominal, PPP, per capita , ultimately these will show good results only when the ecnonomy is actually growing. It is super easy to set lofty goals far away in the future by the time in which no one will remember these promises. Thought an economist would understand the concept of compounding but apparently not. They can say india will be a $100 tn economy and the godi gang will lap it up. Their numbers are meaningless Looks like someone drank the government’s kool aid! Time to wake up bro. We about to be hittin’ a big-ass slowdown from where I can see. Haha, most of you dont know we are building a $4 trillion temple to bridge the gap. Let's fix starvation, pollution, human rights, women's rights and the basics first, shall we? Why so much concern over global image? Pretentious af. massive unemployment is happening now. India cannot industrialize in the 21st century. The time for that was the 20th century. It's too late. Pack your bags. but unemployment is massive. absolutely massive. See page 28 of this [report](https://publications.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/5166/1/State_of_Working_India_2023_ebook_revised.pdf) GDP is growing, stocks are at an all time high, inflation is fairly under control, they're inviting companies in, easing regulations for them, loosening labor laws. What do you want them to do, employ people directly? GDP is growing but the employment elasticity of growth has been falling since around 2012, which implies that the number of jobs created per percent increase in GDP growth has been falling rapidly. All developing countries are undergoing [premature deindustrialization](https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/premature_deindustrialization_revised2.pdf). There's evidence to suggest that we have basically missed the [bus on manufacturing](https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/a_new_growth_strategy_for_developing_nations.pdf). As to what can be done? Not much really: rich countries are rich enough to implement some sort of basic income scheme if the need arises in the future , but India is not in a position to do so. My best guess is that Indians illegal immigration will shoot up in spades. One can hope the government can sign treaties to legitimize this immigration. So it's not a point against this govt if there is literally no way out. No its not a point against thee government in the sense that I dont believe any opposition could do better in this situation. Its more a point against the propaganda that the government puts out and the people espouse enthusiastically. No government in India has had this kind of feverish appeal and undeserved hysteria around them than this one. The writing is on the wall. If the public wish to bury their heads in the sand, then they will suffocate in it. Those \"idiots\" we make fun off for trying to illegally sneak into America can see what is coming and -- seeing that they have nothing to lose -- have made the best decision they could. The ruling party can't do anything, the opposition can't do anything, but the ruling party makes roads and temples and gets trains replaced. BC I'm confused whether I'm a troll or a contrarian for the fuck of it. This past month I've been a Rohit Sharma fan and a Modi bhakt, when I almost lost an IRL friendship during an argument between Rohit and Virat (I was at the latter's side) and I've gotten over Modi since 3 years. As for the illegal immigrants, they go there with stars in their eyes and no education, to do shit jobs and live like dogs. You could do that in India at any time, there's no lack of shit jobs here. Waiters in America make over 60k in Chicago in tips alone. I’ve met a couple of waiters in Indian restaurants that are illegals. They have saved over 300k in 10 years by living frugally with roommates. They go back to India with those savings and can actually live somewhat comfortably Oh I see it's not cool anymore to talk about vision2020. Just like it won't be cool to talk about 7 trillion economy in 2030"
