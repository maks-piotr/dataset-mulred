        "Watched The Terminal List yesterday. One of the best action shows that I have watched recently.\n\nStarted watching old 80s show Lonesome Dove today. Similar to The Adventures of Brisco County Junior. Classic 80s action. Really love that genre. \n\nHad finished the Rambo , Creed and Rocky movies last 2 weeks.",
        "Ngl, I didnt like it as much as the season 1 or the season 2 endings. The season 3 episode 7 seemed more like a season ending episode with that twist. \n\nThis episode had people doing stupid shit which was not necessary. I mean Butcher could have ended Homelander if he chose to.",
        "S1 I would try to strike up a boys conversation with folks and no one cared! Now it’s the rage…",
        "Finally watched Vikram. Seriously, what was the fuss all about? This is probably Kanagaraj's weakest film. Too long, too boring. Kaithi was much better than this one. Same old story about drugs and serial killer. Kamal Hassan's acting and stunts are embarassing to say the least. Fahad is the only saving grace. I'm left with a question, why do our South Indian brothers rate mediocre movies so highly on imdb?",
        "I am from South and I had the same opinion about the movie. It was mediocre work. I saw this movie second day at theatres and formed this opinion. Many liked it apparently, but always got judged when I said the movie was below average.",

        "Banshee",
        "Kaithi had a few things going for it... \n\nFirst of all, Karthi's performance was pretty convincing and you cared for the character, unlike in Vikram where I was almost indifferent to Kamal Hassan's character. \n\nSecondly, the relationship with the daughter was well set up and their reunion worked emotionally in the climax.\n\nThirdly the action sequences were better conceived and shot. In Vikram, Kanagaraj relied heavily on these [camera robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIwdCN4dV6w). These action scenes feel shallow and uncreative, as more attention was paid to the camera movement rather the actual action scene.\n\nI also felt Kaithi's music was better written. That guitar riff kept playing in my mind for a few days after watching it. Here Anirudh did good job, but that's about it.",
        "Hmmm maybe I expected Kaithi to be better and felt let down. Yeah Karthi was good and the action and overall plot was fine.\nBut since you mention it, I gotta say that the reunion, as well as the college kids subplot didn't work for me at all. It was as if those characters were shoehorned in for a token female presence and I didn't feel anything emotional in their arcs. Maybe it's just me.",
