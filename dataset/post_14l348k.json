So ig sm1 would've spread fake news that he's gonna slaughter it in the society but if he did it every year then people should have corrected the info. If that part was communicated to the mob then it's defo just nuisance value or some1petty trying to win the society elections If he was taking the goat to slaughter in a residential area(atho he was not), opposing it would not have been Islamophobia(altho I hate the word cuz sometimes muslims say this even when someone is criticising Islam or its practices and not demonising the people themselves). But these people clearly weren't there for animal rights or caring about residential rules but cuz of hate against a community since they were shouting JSR while doing this ijbol while reading your comment Is being afraid of religions a \"phobia\" though? I would say even in context of India only, it's totally reasonable to fear the religious folk. Phobia is irrational fear of something. Nothing phobic about rational fear of religious teachings which are ridiculous, illogical, unscientific and heinous at times."
