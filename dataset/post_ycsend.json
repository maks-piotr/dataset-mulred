        "Has anyone played LOTR Online? I am an avid LOTR fan and missing the lore now that the tRoP s1 is over",
        "The game seems to me like a mobile game which was released for PC after the 'games as a service' parts were removed \n\nOne of my friends got it. He says it's super duper grindy too",
        "Playing GTA 4 and Arkham City\n\n9/10 for Both\n\nAfter GTA San Andreas and Batman Arkham Asylum which were like 10/10 these games are upgrades yet so.ething seems lacking. Gta 4 is amazing. Better graphics, gunplay but lacks in music and driving . It has Better physics, story and script but lacks the style and substance and has too much extra stuff like bowling or darts thats not needed. But thats just gta. The only reason I give Arkham City 9/10 is because I havent finished it yet and I liked the Arkham Asylum limited arsenal better. Arkham city has soooo much to do. Its overload at once so I am taking it slow. I am pretty sure I will give it 11/10 at new game plus\n\nPlan on playing dead space and black mesa mod later",
        "&gt;LOTR Online\n\nIts a very old game with dated mechanics but still fun.",
        "Wild rift",
        "I loved the arkham games. But this just looks shit. Also most people hated it. So yeah. I would recommend you get elden ring instead.",
        "Don't sleep on black mesa man, definitely give it a shot. It's an incredible game and you'll appreciate it even more if you have played the original but even if you haven't you'll absolutely love it. As for dead space I will highly recommend the remake, it's looking phenomenal. You can play the original game if you like, its certainly a great game to this day but unfortunately the pc version has its own issues so it would be much better to go with the remake. Have fun and let's go bowling.",
        "I will play black mesa for sure. Half life 1 and 2 were some of the best if not the best games I have played. Is xen completed now btw?\n\nOuch. My pc can run only the old dead space and not the remake. Maybe next year after I get a proper job.\n\nI completed gta 4 on revenge ending. It was fun but Sadly i am not in the mood for bowling. There is no happy ending for niko is there? I changed my view and gta 4 is a 10/10 for me. Bittersweet and realistic. Best gta ever yet for me. This is the reality of the American dream. Left me sad and empty and filled with so much emotion. What a journey. A masterpiece of a game.\n\nI have started the gta 4 dlc lost and the damned right now.",
        "Oh man you are gonna have a time of your life then with black mesa. I'll recommend not rushing it, the little details in the game are pure insane. Its the best remake of any game i've played, I'll be a fool for saying this but I'll put it higher than re 2 remake. But thats just how i feel about the game, you may not like it as much as i did but still its tremendous effort by black mesa devs. Hope you like it. \n\nOh i see, go for the old one then, it still holds up really well. I played many months ago, the only problem with the game is that its locked at 30 fps and there are ways to get it running at 60fps but it'll leave you with horrible screen tearing, atleast that happened to  me.\n\nYeah lots of people think (myself included) revenge is the best ending and also its confirmed to be canon and its the only ending that makes sense. There is not a happy ending unfortunately but i still think revenge was pretty satisfactory. Yeah i agree with you, i love everything about gta 4, i haven't played gta 5 yet but it's the second best gta game for me after san andres.\n\nI haven't played any dlcs tho, are they any good ?",
        "Definitely will play\n\nOk will do.\n\nI think I can run Gta 5 .\n\nI will let you know if the dlcs are good. Seem fun right now."
