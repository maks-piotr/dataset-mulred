Now, I just want to stress that she is definitely not at an Olympic level yet, but had we gone ahead, we would’ve had to pay our own way. On the registration form we were sent, I remember an up-front payment of 10L mentioned plus all other expenses which we would’ve incurred on the way. Now this is in addition to whatever we have already spent at the district, state and national levels plus hours and hours of coaching, travel, stay, etc. You get the gist. There is zero aid for my daughter’s sport and doing it on our own as an average middle class family isn’t easy. Maybe things will change one day.",

While in India we aren't forceful or so obsessed to create a gold medal winner that's why the Olympic bid appalls me. Since we are a democracy our athletes can't go trough the close to abusive condition like China why I am comparing with China is well us has all the facilities and investment and well endowed and sponsored program like the college acca system as well cause us has some of the richest universities in the planet. Also this ruby girl us one won a medal asked for donation to improve the sport a lady donated 4 mill not to the athlete but the program that's doesn't happen a lot cause donations go to the athlete not the program.

Your pool of eligible olympians isn't your population specifically, it is your population of affluent and privileged people.  If India had the GDP per capita and development of the U.S., it would probably earn half the medals.\n\nIn many ways, becoming an Olympian is an upper middle class and above affair because to achieve this, you need expensive training, expensive coaches, expensive mentors who connect you to the right places, and parents with the bandwidth to do all of this for you when you are young.  How many parents in India have the bandwidth to do this, especially when they have larger families than the developed world?",

Maybe the 2nd one also some times but not that much.\n\nMain reason is infrastructure, of course.\n\nHow many parents can afford private trainings and sending their kids in a good city?\n\nPlus, the career challenges. What do the kids do in their career if they couldn't make it to the very top? Think of it, a professional sportsperson would be deeply into it right from his/her early teenage. This also is the time when he was supposed to build his academics base. You can choose only one. How many families can afford that? We all see the ₹ crores being rained on the Olympic winners and all. But what happens to the state champions? District champions? Nothing. They give up their entire academics and then get nothing in life.\n\nIndian middle class cannot afford that.",

Among all the things we can spend our money and resources on, why Olympic medals? Other than bragging rights, what does it give us exactly? \n\nSpend money instead on giving kids access to playgrounds (a rare commodity in cities) and sports facilities.

        "It is indeed one incident, and very different from your earlier claims that they have a \"scary obsession with Olympic\" or that they \"literally they test every school by activating muscle of 7 years old\".\n\nFrom your earlier comment, who actually cares about online murmurs? Do you have any idea what the average online murmurs are like about India? You wouldn't like it. But it doesn't matter, online murmurs aren't important nor do they say anything about the truth.\n\nBtw if you look at the number of Olympic disqualifications and stripped medals, an actual statistic rather than an anecdote like you linked, China doesn't look bad at all for a country that brings hundreds of athletes to the Olympics. China has 4 stripped medals, the US 10, and Russia 46. Goes to show that comparing China to Russia is a joke.\n\nIndia is also worse than China if you look at doping. Let's again look at a statistic instead of one incident.\n\nhttps://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-tops-list-of-doping-offenders-in-2022-wada-anti-doping-report-124040500251_1.html\n\n*India has emerged as the country with the highest percentage of doping offenders, according to the 2022 testing figures released by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The report revealed that out of 4,064 samples collected from Indian athletes (including urine, blood, and athlete biological passports), 127 individuals tested positive for banned substances, constituting 3.26 per cent of the sample size.*\n\n*India's doping violations outnumber those of major sporting nations such as Russia (85), the United States (84), Italy (73), and France (72). China conducted the highest number of samples testing - 17,357 during the counting period - with an adverse findings percentage of 0.25 per cent.*",
        "> They won bronze at the last Olympics. They are on an upswing **due to a tremendous amount of investment into it**\n\nExactly my point. You invest in it, medals might come as a side effect. \n\n\n> Olympics are the pinnacle of the sports that are there\n\nOlympics are the pinnacle of fleecing host countries by a deeply sleazy body that is outmatched in corruption only by FIFA.",
        "Same with Fiji.",
        "Formal salaried folks are extremely low in number. Informal, yes that would be huge but no taxes there.",
        "Bro why you asking us middle class? You want us to earn 15LPA, pay taxes and also play sports? Pagal hai Kya?",
        "Sports and fitness needs to be in way of life and culture to push the government to prepare infrastructure and produce great athletes. We lack that at the moment. I live in Netherlands and I can see people in every age group (right from a baby who has just learned to walk to someone in 90s) are into some or other kind of fitness activity. Their infrastructure and training academies are amazing. Their schools play great part in making them better, if not schools, there are sports centers who do exactly that. \n\nI hope we as a country will reach there someday. \n\n\nSecond very important part that not a lot of people talk about is gene pool. Our ancestors were settlers in the most “easy to live” part of the world (I am talking about thousands of years back). Our bodies did not develop much for harsh conditions. On top of that Indian diet is not the most nutritious in the world (when it comes to superior athletics), lack of protein, high carbs makes us way weaker than the countries that have protein rich diets.",
        "Brij Bhushan like people across sports bodies are responsible for girls getting discouraged to participate in sports.",
        "Just being curious, how come private college in the USA has such amazing facilities? Is it from the beginning? Or has it evolved over time? Many Govt colleges in India have a lot of good facilities but that's because they could get land for cheap. For private colleges, sports ranks lower in their priority list.",
        "> their family's money to fund their dreams in inital stages.\n\nAnd politicians would scoop down to take credit and gift tax payers money as if it's their money.",
        "STATED FACTS!!",
        "> Instead of the Olympics, if a good opportunity came across the parents' way for their son to get into the IPL, would Indian parents do whatever was needed to come up with the financial resources?\n\nThey will try for every opportunity for their children. Olympics is once in four years event. While IPL more frequent with lot more opportunities in various teams. Also there seems to be lot more money for cricket in India.",
        "At times I do feel like ambanis and adanis should step up to help our athletes, it's the best they can do",
        "not to mention everyone wants india to place and win medals but most of those people also don't want their own kids to do anything except studies...even if the kid is talented in a sport, they'll be forced to give it up to focus on 10th, 12th, and so on...can't have your cake and eat it too",
        "Exactly - just imagine how many billions Modi would pump into the system if India was awarded an Olympic Games🤔\n\nThe cost of entry to some sports is way too high in India - which is why cricket and football are so popular. There are athletes like Neeraj and Mirabai Chanu but you either need rich benefactors or government help (like the Aussie Institute of Sport) to get to the Olympics.",
        "Nz and Jamaica are outliers. Nz has a strategic outlook to medalling. They prioritise their funds to higher medal prospects. There was a criticism that other sports don’t grow because of this. For eg their rowing teams get a lot of the budget. They have less money and they are smart about using it to get max medals.\n\nJamaica is entirely a track and field giant. Both these countries have the highest medal per capita.\n\nI lived in nz for 5 years, they have decent sporting facilities at the grassroots level.\n\nBaseline is that it still costs money to get medals. Larger economies can spend a lot but there is a huge cost to a medal.",
        "That’s again a feeling because we don’t see outside our bubbles.\n\n60% of Mumbai lives in slums. One can safely say they don’t earn more than 15 lakhs a year. \n\nThe definition of middle class is quite interesting. Is it an economically secure family with basic needs met, a vehicle, kids going to college? Or is it the middle of the pyramid?",
        "none of that have much to do with it.\n\nforget 50% even if 90% are malnourished, the remaining 10% is still bigger than a lot of countries that do top Olympics so we do have the numbers on our side, we are also about the youngest country to we also have age on our side.\n\npersonal beliefs don't affect your ability to compete in Olympics, essential infrastructure for being an athlete is a gym and internet so yeah we do have essential infrastructure.\n\nwith the numbers we have, things like casteism, corruption and sexual abuse will still very much not impede our ability to top in Olympics.\n\nThe actual reason actually isn't malnutrition but a lack of balanced diet, you becoming an athele means you are going to have to train a lot your average vegetable simply can't provide the amount of energy and other required not to mention the sheer amount of things you won't find in a vegetable (this is actually the main reason for a lot of widespread n india) you need meat and not just chicken meat but all kinds of meat and top quality at that the kind that will make your family disown you. And then comes the expenses, you need a diet plan made by best dieticians in the world and have to follow it 24/7 + you will also need a coach which means becoming an athlete ie very expensive and you won't have much pay if you did become one due to lack of market unless it's cricket.",
        "Did they emigrate and lose the amazing Indian capacity to reproduce ?",
        "India should get out of this low cost mentality in everything. Why can’t we have best athletes at high cost? Why not have ISRO launch high-cost missions ?",
        "Rampant casteism in selection process? Do you mean the upper caste? Because upper caste are hardly there, most of the sportsmen come from Northern states, like Haryana and Punjab. And they stay on the merit. So how is it about casteism..",
        "yep, I read somewhere that Indian athletes in Paris is eating Dal-Chawal :)",
        "You hve to evaluate smething called cost and ease of living. This analogy goes like \"Oh 300 people died, you guys only lost ur hand, u r pretty normal\"",
        "you people need to really figure out how much money it actually takes to live decently.",
        "Because the PE period in school always gets replaced with Maths period.",
        ">Your ignorance is showing\n\nSo long as my man boobs are not",
        "Like?",
        "Written by none other than the Suraj Yengde. It's thanks to a few guys like him out there than the West is learning about Ambedkar, and the history of various social justice movements in India.\n\nWhen the affluent brahmins emigrated to the US in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, they did their due diligence in wrongfully painting an image of all Indians as cow worshipping, vegetarians -- the simson's Apu. And those who penetrated academia did their best to keep Ambedkar's name out of their analysis and textbooks.  \n\nIt's only recently, with more and more Dalits and OBCs emigrating that Western academics are learning about the rich history of our struggle against casteism.",
        "I mean… it’s quite obvious why",
        "A quick look through the medals tally in any of the past Olympics will show plenty of 3rd world developing countries above India. Most of these countries follow a pattern and win in a small number of specific events (Jamaica: track & field etc.) If India had a more calculated approach and injected funds into a small number of sports we would prolly still get more medals than we do now.",
        "Lol. Right? I was like \"am I poor?\"😭 . Okay just checked my bank balance and I am definitely poor and not in middle class anymore.",
        "Incredible India!",
        "where in guwahati?",
        "Railway colony maligaon",
        "Disagree, China had very similar per-capita gdp and population in 1984 olympics. They won 32 medals and were placed 4th while india won ZERO medals that year",
        "All the things you listed happen with other poor African and Caribbean nations, but they still routinely win medals and have top runners in the world. It's more then just that culture and genetics play a factor",
        "Because we’re poor country?",
        "Yea. And no aspirations."

So stop with your bewildered questions. The problems are obvious. Just open your eyes and see.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Every problem in this country can be traced back to overpopulation, iam yet to see an issue which is not directly or indirectly a result of overpopulation.... Overpopulation and lack of education/awareness/critical thinking is the root cause that we need to tackle on an urgent basis to solve 90-95% of all our problems.... Why are Indians who have emigrated to other countries not snapping up Olympic medals for their adopted countries? They have access to the same world class facilities and there is no casteism or corruption either. They do make it cricket teams and excel in other fields such as spelling bee, politics, etc. It’s an expensive game. My daughter, being a national medal winner, was eligible to try out for the Olympic team in her sport. Now, I just want to stress that she is definitely not at an Olympic level yet, but had we gone ahead, we would’ve had to pay our own way. On the registration form we were sent, I remember an up-front payment of 10L mentioned plus all other expenses which we would’ve incurred on the way. Now this is in addition to whatever we have already spent at the district, state and national levels plus hours and hours of coaching, travel, stay, etc. You get the gist. There is zero aid for my daughter’s sport and doing it on our own as an average middle class family isn’t easy. Maybe things will change one day. They are. Watch Sunil Chettri's video. It covers it well Simple. All those early immigrants were upper caste and vegetarians. They would never do any physical sports to begin with, and that culture still continues. Stop painting it like as though Indians don't have a sports culture here beyond cricket. Or that there is no casteism here that deprives us of talent. Because for every medals in 2024 Olympics , person has to listen to our beloved Modi ji on phone. Yes, I should also put this on the list. I lol’d at vegetarian, hope that was a joke. His silhouette will take the dominant place in every photo Tamils and Punjabis would like to have a word with you Indian don't know that how protein intake is important. Is this the same for all athletes across India? How do they ones who seem to come from poor families make it to the Olympics then? Just trying to understand who gets aid and who doesn't. How delusional are you to believe Olympic level vegetarian/vegan athletes don't exist? Very weak argument, this. Which sport ? Or is it like that for all sports ? Yea that's cuz even if we emigrate, we don't leave our idiotic mindsets behind. I don't think any of the emigrated families want their kids to go into sports. Jobs and studies will always be the first things being pushed onto their kids. One of the main reasons why we're lacking is we just got independence 75 years ago. We were left with almost nothing. Multiple wars after that and everything made it even worse. It takes more than 100 years to build up. And we're a large country with a huge population, for us coming out of poverty would be the main preference rather than sports which does not feed you enough. This is for Skateboarding. Sorry, I’m not sure what the situation is like for other sports. Damn!! no wonder we have such less medals India got independence \"75 years ago\" That's not an excuse anymore This is what happens when all the money gets spent on the non Olympic sport of cricket. Is there skateparks in kerala. India has no culture of aiming to be best at anything in the world. They have the culture of being best in the mohalla (local area) Agree to all your points. Just one correction, if you earn 15 LPA (as do I), please do not call yourself middle class just by looking at your own social circle. You are top 5% of India. Kese hoga jab tak school mai Games period mai maths sir extra class lenge Besides, coaching for any sport has become expensive. In most physically demanding sport, diet is highly important. A nephew of mine is into shooting. I believe he has played tournaments as well and is good at the craft. It is hella expensive though. And uss k papa millionaire hai. He can afford paying for the shooting training. Besides his father is encouraging of kids trying to do something different. Not many indian parents have this mindset. Mostly, parents have a reluctant mindset regarding encouraging their child to take parts in sports. Yeh sab kar ke kya milega? Padhne Beth Jaa chupchap..parichhhhhha najdeeeeek aa rha hai school mai 95%, phir iit, desh se bhaago mnc mai heavy package leke, 27 main shaadi, 30 me pehla bachha, 35 mai dusra bachha, 40 ko flat kharido, 45 mai diabetes, phir usska bachha school mai jaake wohi cycle repeat karni hai. We don’t have public skateparks like in other states, but we have two small private skateparks. One owned by the SISP Kovalam Skate Club and one in Ravipuram, Kochi called the Loop. Pretty logical. I wonder why you’re at “-13”? I did upvote. It seems like they come from poor families because the costs of getting there makes their families poor. (/s) Bro, Japan had two atom bombs dropped on it and South Korea wasn't much economically developed than us until the past few decades ,not to mention China which has a large population too. It's entirely on the attitude of the Nation and the government. :( , I can now see how expenses rack up. I don't know why your comment is getting voted down as I agree, just look at Australia for example a small country with a large amount of athletes attending the games. Infrastructure before population growth is important but unfortunately, India has missed the boat on this one. Because the truth hurts and when no one has a valid argument against it they just vote for it down. India is a very poor country, forget the percapita income they are misleading because of high earners. Avg Indian is struggling to survive, middle class is similar except they have a few assets like house or bike etc, Olympics is a elite event, you need lot of money to prepare and train, infra for that stuff is non existent here, government basically has to give grains to 80 crore population to prevent mass riots., you can't expect anything out of a country like this. Democracy works in an ideal circumstance like most of the population is homogeneous and educated, in India it never will, the wealthy will always horde wealth and the masses will remain starving only. A silhouette is just an outline, or egoistical PM can’t be satisfied without a full photo Since globally that income is below Middle class, we loose ton of purchasing power because of high taxes etc in India, it's not suprising that people with such income consider themselves middle class. 15 lakhs and middle class? Bro, you are among one of the top 5% richest people in india Most are recent migrants, and trying to survive, give it another generation or two, we may see results Unless their is something intrinsic in that country which discriminates against migrants from India, like Malaysia for example. Did proportionate money distribution to different state association. How does one become eligible? Do you know how many people were eligible? I am trying to figure out if it is feasible to provide aid for everyone who is eligible. I also have no idea how it works in other countries. You'll probably repeat this after 500 years also. I remember one interview of Abhinav bindra, where he said that, just for his training and gears cost upwards of a crore back then, it's really costly actually, where most of the Indians can't afford Sometimes you will get private sponsors Victim mentality will only hold us back So 95%ile is middle class now. How will someone win a medal at the age of 25-35 without any training In teenage years. What sort of stupid question is this ? I‘m german so i only know my immigrant indian friends but they are not vegetarian. But they all had richer parents, yeah. Lot of excuses about resources, money etc. We need to remember that there are poor countries which excel in sports. Even the ones from rich countries, it is wrong think that all of them were born in privileged families. Think about the athletes and basketball players of US for example. There are are many who came up from challenging circumstances and became world class athletes by their sheer determination. Once they proved themselves, yes, the system will take care. But one needs to make the first step to make that happen. Buraai sang mel rachaya, phir kabhi na chhoote uska saaya Add coronary bypass to that “Overpopulation is the problem!”- No, lack of industrialisation, no manufacturing jobs and a non existent huge base of middle class population is the core of our problem. Some of it comes down to historical happenstance, some comes down to lack of industrialisation and deindustrialization of the remaining industrialised areas , and some of it comes from lack of political will from all the political parties. Pakistan and Uk have very similar population density but UK is miles ahead, India has a higher population density than pakistan, you wouldnt argue that pakistan has it better, would you? When pointing out that x is caused by y, you need to provide some evidence. Corruption in the System China has the same issues. The biggest issue is corruption and a lack of physical activity in young children. What about second gen and third gen Indians who were born abroad? The likes of Kamala Harris, Rishi Sunak, Leo Varadkar, etc. can rise to the top governing roles in their countries, but no Indian origin athletes feature among the Olympic medals. It is our mentality which stops us from excelling in sports, not to mention the obsession over Cricket. That's the point, Olympics is soft power game bullshit for powerful countries compete with each other instead of getting bored and waging war against each other. When India manages to solve those deep issues they may think on preparing better for this event. Abinav Bhindra said the same in an interview, He could win gold only because he was rich enough to go to Germany and get trained under world's best coach. A reason why he started an athletic training center for young talents who cannont affort world class training. Maybe they had sponsors. If I ever become rich , I will definitely sponsor many kids' education/art/sports. I know people out there who do that stuff. 15 LPA won't get you anywhere in a city when you have a wife, kid and parents to support. That's the story of the average 15 LPA earner. 18 LPA+ is where you start to move above middle class. Casteism, lack of ethics in all levels. I think my list is smaller 😷 Ehh you are aware that there are millions of young Indians in Western countries who have spent their entire childhood there right Read the comments from the last 10 olympics Compare the population! Chinese cities are well developed. If you go to their villages it's similar to India. They didn't have their resources taken out of the country. Why not!? No one's giving it as an excuse. It's just a fact. Our actual economic progress started in 1990s. Britain spent 6 million dollars PER MEDAL won in 2012 London olympics. That is the level of investment needed to win medals. This is on top of existing infrastructure, youth level support system, higher social security and sports culture that already existed. The medals that India wins are truly a miracle. It’s despite the systemic shortcomings. In some cases like wrestling, badminton, we have a well funded system to an extent. Having a billion people counts for jack. Money, Culture, Climate, Genetics. Username checks out. Agar doctor ya engineer ya IAS nahin ban sakte to nikal ja hhar se bahr !!! Olympic khelega tu ? Aukat dekhi hain ? /s It's expensive, too much politics, caste and also we don't have nation wide scouting system and also lack of interest personally parents would rather see Dr and engineer or graduates than athlete not much scope. Vs China they have an scary obsession with Olympic she scan nearly every school and nurture the talent in a robotic fashion toxic as well if you get less than silver you are ridiculed like hell and state takes 60% of their earning for raising the I saw documentary on Yao ming and a reel on weight lifters in China. While in India we aren't forceful or so obsessed to create a gold medal winner that's why the Olympic bid appalls me. Since we are a democracy our athletes can't go trough the close to abusive condition like China why I am comparing with China is well us has all the facilities and investment and well endowed and sponsored program like the college acca system as well cause us has some of the richest universities in the planet. Also this ruby girl us one won a medal asked for donation to improve the sport a lady donated 4 mill not to the athlete but the program that's doesn't happen a lot cause donations go to the athlete not the program. All in all I feel we need better scouts and awareness as wining gold gets you alot in India even a salaried position if i am not mistaken as India does alot That’s like, your opinion. You are technically in the top 5% if you are earning 15 lakhs. If you are middle class, then visualise the pyramid and you will realize it doesn’t make sense. Yep, the formula for how many medals a nation earns is simple: population * income per capita. Your pool of eligible olympians isn't your population specifically, it is your population of affluent and privileged people. If India had the GDP per capita and development of the U.S., it would probably earn half the medals. In many ways, becoming an Olympian is an upper middle class and above affair because to achieve this, you need expensive training, expensive coaches, expensive mentors who connect you to the right places, and parents with the bandwidth to do all of this for you when you are young. How many parents in India have the bandwidth to do this, especially when they have larger families than the developed world? bad genetics It's depressing that it only takes 15 Lakhs to be in top 5% but in an absolute sense that amount doesn't mean much in cities with all the typical responsibilities you have as a man. That's why he mentioned \"so called\" Can you please translate? I’d add in the intemperate climate and the lack of a developed middle class, as well as an emphasis on education over sport in middle class parenting, as contributing factors. Only the last one is true among your 5 points. Maybe the 2nd one also some times but not that much. Main reason is infrastructure, of course. How many parents can afford private trainings and sending their kids in a good city? Plus, the career challenges. What do the kids do in their career if they couldn't make it to the very top? Think of it, a professional sportsperson would be deeply into it right from his/her early teenage. This also is the time when he was supposed to build his academics base. You can choose only one. How many families can afford that? We all see the ₹ crores being rained on the Olympic winners and all. But what happens to the state champions? District champions? Nothing. They give up their entire academics and then get nothing in life. Indian middle class cannot afford that. Most parents, even educated ones, see sports as \"lafantarbaazi\" as sportspersons rarely get good pay and infrastructure in India unless you are a cricketer. This creates a disastrous feedback loop, where people who can prove themselves in sports are not going into it professionally and the overall investment and infrastructure remains barebones and non existent. Furthermore, even if someone has the support of their family, equipment and other resources are still very expensive for middle class families to afford and they are definitely needed to compete on a global stage. A middle class family will see the same money be better invested in education as the child will be able to get a better job with that (tho jobs are definitely not an option now lol thanks Dankapati) Why are you getting downvoted for speaking facts If this is related: It's the quote from Ra.one And imagine winning just one WC in 10 years after being such a powerful & rich cricket playing nation 🤐 If you are lucky, you will be able to get a sponsor. I can empathise. It just means we underestimate how unequal and poor our country is. 10L🤯 seriously... people from poor families are struggling to get 2 square meals a day. Making it to the olympics is not what's on their mind Please tell me why I should care about India's medal tally in the Olympics. Don't get me wrong, the athletes have worked hard for the results they get and they absolutely deserve all the adulation they get and more. What I don't understand is why we give any importance to increasing our medal count. Among all the things we can spend our money and resources on, why Olympic medals? Other than bragging rights, what does it give us exactly? Spend money instead on giving kids access to playgrounds (a rare commodity in cities) and sports facilities. That will improve kids physical and mental health. Spend money on nutrition too. Maybe all this will improve our medal tally as a side effect but that shouldn't be our objective. Lol 😆 they can't digest fact The majority of households in our country lives in poverty and their children don't have the privilege or resources to pursue a career in sports. Their aim is to get some sort of job that will ensure sustenance. But to be fair, this is not an India-specific phenomenon. High-income generally do better than others in Olympics and similar sporting events. The answer lies in the school imo. Do you remember what the teachers, the parents and other students and literally everyone wanted you to do in school? Just get better grades. That is the only thing everyone cared for and what even I cared for during those days because it is made engrained in our brain that only marks matter. Extra curriculars were always something which was for fun. And sometimes even if you are really good at it parents think it's not gonna make his future or something. So I think it's the mentality of the Indians itself which has led to this Which state has public skateparks in India 🥲 South African government doesn't give financial aid but if they do it's very limited. Most times the parents pay with the help of big business. What is big business doing in India? In South Africa business get a tax reduction if they donate to a NPO or a sporting body. can anyone share link please, thanks Just to play the devils advocate here. Instead of the Olympics, if a good opportunity came across the parents' way for their son to get into the IPL, would Indian parents do whatever was needed to come up with the financial resources? Most of us think IT is the answer and we seldom look beyond IT to survive Timing! Most people move abroad in their 20s. It takes anywhere from 5-30 years to become a citizen in the new country. By the time they are citizens, they’re mostly past their prime. Not to mention that coaches and organizations spend time and money to develop people from scratch when they’re young. You can’t just walk in asking for your turn at 25-30. Some still make it, but you underestimate how difficult it is! Because in Olympics they don't host the games Indians are good at. Like, - driving in traffic, (1,000m, 5,000m, 10,000m) - littering (urinals, spitting, garbage, freestyle) - how to hang on in an overcrowded bus/train (100m, 500m, 1,000m) - how many tuitions can you handle (call it the tuition marathon) - count money (1000 notes, 10,000 notes, 100,000 notes) Not arguing wuth you but China is another overpopulated giant but they have decent medals. The fault is in our mindsets. We constantly keep blaming politicians, government or something else for our incompetency. The previous commenter said emigrated, which implies the person moved to the country and wasn't born there. Mostly they don't. The reason why India has historically won medals in sports like shooting is that shooting is very much a rich persons sport. A country's economic strength plays a crucial role in its ability to compete successfully in the Olympics. When basic needs are met, individuals and governments can afford to invest time, money, and resources into sports, leading to better training, facilities, and overall performance, which ultimately translates into more Olympic medals I don't think he means to take credit from the players . Bcoz every country's pm does this after the Olympics its just a way of saying that the country is proud of u and also kyuki pm se puraskar milna badi hoti hai . nice armchair analysis , you'll get 5 marks for the 5 bullets if this were a CBSE exam Yet they still make it sometimes. And my question is how. Why is his photo on COVID certificate? Is that also for \"puraskar\"? \"so called middle class\" was a jab Our country is not as poor as we imagine nor as rich as we imagine. The real problem is the wealth disparity. Poor is extremely poor to have basic amenities and rich have more than they need. I stand with the other poster though. Arguing that 15lpa is top 5% means nothing and diminishes the real problem of affording a sustainable quality of life for a family when a family has to struggle to meet even a single unexpected event (like healthcare). Also consider the fact that people in the middle income class spread are a majority. At least near me I know there's one in Guwahati and one in Naharlagun (Arunachal Pradesh) Lack of money from government for participants. The fact that this question comes up every 4 years is the very reason we dont top the charts in Olympics: We simply dont care enough. Correct but I was giving u an explanation for the Olympics one . And there might be a reason for covid one as well if I get an answer I will inform u Is that a protein? You should see the skatepark in Chandigarh, it’s beautiful! Nationals last year was held there. Just 2% Indians earn enough to pay income tax, people earning 15L would be in top 1% easily. Bro you lost all respect. Keep your divisive politics to yourself and people like yourself. When talking about national issues, people nowadays want solutions and no finger pointing. Hopefully this continues to be the trend and trash thinking like yours gets weeded out of our society and government. 15 lakhs per annum is pretty much middle class my friend Does not help that a lot of highly educated people emigrate. in what world lmao Is India really better than Pakistan? Both country are similar IMO. That very much also depends on where you live and how many people you are responsible for (dependent family). Even after a household income of 25lpa+ , you are probably upper middle class family in a tier 1 city. It's not a lot of money when you see how much goes in tax. Is costs the only problem or there are problems with the selection of talented players too. I cannot agree that probablistically India would not have had a single super talented person like Phelps or Bolt. Numerous businesses don't show their real earnings. I knew somone who earned around 40lpa but payed tax for 6lpa only. Also got EWS certificate for his kid. Because winning a medal is a testimony to the overall infrastructure and competency of the country in that particular sport. It gives the sport national limelight which helps in its development and budget allocation. For example, If a badminton player wins a medal, there will be a surge in no. of children who get signed up for badminton training and create further employment. Sports isn't just something to watch and enjoy, it's an employment sector that is severely under-utilised in india. Oops 😶 If anyone has some time, do watch Mukkabaaz movie. Might get some answers. Our athletes are absolutely godlike given the limited support they get. Olympics was anyway meant for amateurs. Countries during Cold War took it over themselves to push different narratives and it became difficult for amateurs. It's a risky career We would have gotten guaranteed medals in wrestling but thanks to that ahole and his supreme leader, all our wrestlers have retired. Well that's the problem. The government should be doing the lion's share of the sponsoring considering how much they hype up the medal winners. Like everything else in the country sports development is considerably broken. They pay lip service to athletics but claim all the credit when someone does beat the odds and wins. Something like 10 crores was spent on Abhinav Bindra's training which paid off when he took gold in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This is unthinkable for most families honestly I would rather the government provide more aid to build schools with proper teachers than build stadiums. The chances of a kid making it to the Olympics is astronomically lower than them getting a good education and make a comfortable living. Well they make us stop all sports and extra curricular activities and then ask these questions India can produce great track athletes at low cost if infrastructure is developed. If they spend moderately on Nutrition, recovery docs and trainers. No such state is willing to built a world class track. All they know is cricket. Sports budget allocation is reaching in pockets of politicians and administrations. Your daughter should have studied at LPU /s Im sure other factors do contribute, but there is a huge hidden pressure that guides students towards more financially stable white collar jobs, than pursuing sports. Because we are a poor country, whose elites (the top 10% who can afford sports) care more about education than athletics. Its that simple. >talents who cannont affort world class training. Did the Turkish Chad enrol at his center too? Because sure as hell, he looked like he just got there in his pajamas Lol this is a myth, I used to think the same but now seeing how things work here in the US, its complete BS. Nearly all athletes here (except swimming and Basketball and maybe a few other popular sports) have to hustle on their own with little to no government support, and yet they perform brilliantly. Here there is a culture of excellence and striving to be the best, but without the psychological burden that people face in India. > Because winning a medal is a testimony to the overall infrastructure and competency of the country in that particular sport Why do you care about such a testimony? > If a badminton player wins a medal, there will be a surge in no. of children who get signed up for badminton training and create further employment. Let's test that. For a period the Indian hockey team was dominant, winning gold. In fact the Indian hockey is the most successful team **ever** in Olympics, having won 8 golds, five of those as independent India. Where is the Indian hockey team today? > Sports isn’t just something to watch and enjoy, it’s an employment sector that is severely under-utilised in india. And I don't disagree with that. Where I disagree is that chasing Olympic medals *as the end goal* is the way to get there. Number of businesses are much fewer than salarymen. While these do exist, the absolute number compared to our population would be very low. The one with Raj Shamani? A neighbor's 11-year-old is a national level Chess player. Typical (upper) middle class family that can afford Airfare and Visas to Exotic locales like South Africa, Cairo, Azerbaijan etc to participate in tournaments - for parents plus child. Add to this the cost of tournament fees, hotel stay, khana-peena etc and it adds up to tens of lakhs per year. She gets rewards of few thousand dollars in tournaments she does end up winning... but most of it is simply experience to participate at that level. The kid photo-op with CM, ministers etc after major wins, but absolutely no funding or sponsorship. There are probably a few hundred such families chancing the dream to become the next Praggnanandhaa or Gukesh. A few will get the spotlight, but most will simply have a story to post on reddit and to tell their neighbors. Nothing more, nothing less. It comes down to family support and funding (or the lack of it). My guess is the same plays out in all other sports too. Good answer. There always needs to be some role models for young minds to follow a craft passionately. For example, so many people after the rise of Bruce Lee took martial arts. He is an elite level shooter since more than a decade. Just because he doesn't wear an eye cover doesn't make him a casual athlete who just happened to win a silver medal. Your ignorance is showing. Dude was from the army. Not some random dude. There. You answered your own question, Olympic Medal Tally is kind of an objective way to measure a country’s sports infrastructure, impetus and focus on sports/physical training in school/college curriculum , research & development, scientific temperament, clean liveable cities , access to good quality foods (not like MDH cancer causing and low quality food ingredients and raw materials) , etc If all this is there , then Medal tally is a byproduct of the infrastructure and QoL of a country. Imagine living in a country where rote learning is given more importance, where you don’t have basic clean water, AIR, low quality foods, lack of civic sense, all of which affect your physical and mental health etc etc where corruption crushes whatever good chances despite all these, etc etc etc This answers why developed nations bag highest medals and not countries like ours. By that means rich countries should do better than us but that’s not the case. I see army and few other states and some private money other than that no other support. 15 lakhs per annum is not middle class There are many second generation Indians playing at youth levels and even college in the US. Competition is high to get into Olympic teams. Still athletes like Raj Bhavsar, Kanak Jha come to mind and here is a longer [list](https://olympics.com/en/news/indian-origin-athletes-tokyo-2020-olympics). No sports culture is the reason, African countries have better representation that India in olympics. Where is the Indian hockey team today? They won bronze at the last Olympics. They are on an upswing due to a tremendous amount of investment into it. Just because you don't watch sports, you can't call out things that you are ignorant about. Olympic medals as the end goal. Olympics are the pinnacle of the sports that are there. If that is not the end goal, what is? My younger brother was a national level tennis player, but for further continuation of his coaching to reach the peak of National level and international level it required arduous amount of money and time of investment that was beyond the scope of my family, so in the end he settled for going to jee and studying in college with barely any sports now. Most heads of sport organizations are political appointees and not by merit. So there’s cronyism and politics even in sport here. Many Indian athletes now train internationally to get the best level of coaching as India can’t provide it. >Be 11 years old, tier 2 city >6th standard, fairly talented in athletics >2 periods per week for PT hour, maths teacher and science teacher grab half of it to \"finish syllabus\" >Whatever, come 9th standard >\"Son, you need to start preparing for IITs or AIIMS, I'm enrolling you in a coaching class, you'll have to attend 18 hours a day\" >Whatever interest in sports either vanishes or the skill plateaued \"Why aren't we getting medals in the Olympics despite 4 billion people?\" It still is a rich man's sport. The poor either take loans like Kushale's father did and Kushale got a job to pay off his fathers debt which his dad took for buying equipment for him. Another exception is Saurabh, whose from a farming background, he got into pistol with firstly using second hand pistols which his childhood coach used to train kids. The likes of Manu Bhaker, Abhinav Bindra,Gagan Narang, Apurvi Chandela, Ramit Jindal even Sift Kaur and Anjum.etc are from rich families hence were able to purchase the guns and the equipment on their family's money to fund their dreams in inital stages. If you see demographics of Trinidad and Tobago, 37% are of pure Indian origin. The contribution of Trini Indians in the country's sports is minuscule. We are genetically substandard in the context of sports. Considering every other factor to be the same for all people in trinidad, we still are way down in the sports charts. Google Visnu Shivaraj Pandian, he is an Indian-American who trained in India for 10M air rifle. I personally know him and trust me he is excellent in it and hopefully will play the coming olympics for sure. You mean the financial burden? 10 lakhs INR is not that much for an American earning in USD. I'm assuming some of the costs are standard regardless of the country of the country of origin. Sports culture is one of the reasons, the lack of viewership hurts the revenues of organizers and lessens opportunities for sponsorship by brands as well. Our diet ,genetics and body structure is not for high intensity sports. There has been lot of ground work in football and all stops has been put to atleast qualify for FIFA ., even FiFa organizers want India to be a part of the game. Add to it, WB has football craze which can surpass cricket. But despite all this , where are we ? What is the reason ? Downvote me , but the only reason seems to be tropical climate and our carb rich diet Indian athletics federations are headed by criminals. We all saw how the wrestlers’ protests were handled. Its a joke how people are still askjng this question. Indian athletes do well despite the system not as a result of it. Grassroots level change in sports culture and facilities is needed to elevate our sporting standards. You have written about talent in common people. I wonder why the athletes who get good results in other tournies, even world championship in their sport dont do well in Olympics ? Is there some mental conditioning aspects that we are ignoring. Came here to say just that. He sums it up so well. I would add that's some fault should also be laid on our society at large, especially middle class and upper class.. Our parents want us to play sports as long as studies are not getting affected.. So even if you are decent you are encouraged to drop sports in prime years of developing talent... Lol see what happens in 2028. For those who don't know Cricket will make its debut in the 2028 LA Olympics. Have you looked at the neighbor hood running track or swimming pools in your area in the USA? They are like 1000x better than what you find in India. Have you looked at college gyms and their track and field facilities, my college had like 3 Olympic sized swimming pools and whatnot. In the USA facilities are abundant - what costs money is the coaching and recovery , basically anything where a human is involved. I agree with most of the things except, it never will part. It will, but needs a bigger economy and need progressive taxation to reduce the income inequality. Progressing into future as economy grows our input of athletes will increase as well. It’s gonna take time. Although I don’t dispute that 15 lpa is not middle class. However, No of business man are way more than the salaried class. You do realize that even small shop owners, kirana shop owners etc are also business man, right ? Of course, hence why there is such a good grassroots for cricket in the country and our B teams can rival most countries' main teams. If parents see that there is a possible future in the sport they will support the kid. Would you support me had I put in enough sincere efforts to change all of that for those exactly like you and your daughter? School and college level sports should be encouraged by the government. From grassroot level to the national level sports events may help. Like a local sports events organised in every area by the municipality or block level administration where local schools / colleges will participate. Then every town or block will select their teams from the top performers. Then there would be district level > national level sports. Those sports should be get more publicity and sponsorship at the national level. which sport is it if you dont mind? there are some sports which are a lot more expensive. Reminds me of the 'we don't have the capacity' meme. We simply don't have the infrastructure, culture, economical support, etc to nurture an athlete. Even succesful athletes' careers are short lived. They go into coaching, TV punditry, etc. Most lower level athletes need to pivot to govt jobs, etc. I think people should have a bit of perspective. We're still a country with massive poverty issues, infrastructure burdens and corruption. Winning Olympic medals is nice and for those of us fortunate enough to even care about that so much we have to see where the priorities in terms of budget should lie. So reducing poverty, education, infrastructure, defense, creating employment should still be the highest priority and if we dont have enough money left over to massively increase sports budget ( sports infra, top level coaching, nutrition, etc) Im not too concerned. That being said, Earmarking someone for talent from a young age is the most difficult aspect of finding medal contenders. This is the 1st and probably most difficult step. With us being in a digital age being able to socialize someone like this is a lot easier than before. Then atleast public pressure, crowdfunding can help in getting really deserving athletes what they need. We cant do this for every athlete unfortunately so we need ot have certain benchmarks that they meet for olympic standards. But after that, they should be provided all the funding. Mostly its because you'd need someone from those families who have emigrated for better opportunities to be genetically gifted enough and talented enough to compete in high level sport. College athletics in the U.S. has athletes from all over the world who compete in the olympics. So these kids would already be competing against the best. So the chances of succeeding there are rare. I guess for you family means 2 people or something To the people down voting me, go outside and see the reality guys. You guys seem dumb > Just to play the devils advocate here. While this angle is not trivial it's also a current cope (India has gone through many varieties, for a while in 90s it was genetics are poor fad, then it shifted to something else & so on). We'll soon know in 20-30-40 years time frame IF this really ever was a \"High Enough\" level cause/barrier/issue in India. Because simple population scale of Indians above a certain Economic conditions will be large enough to pool talent for decent Olympics showing. If it happens then theory was correct. If India still underperfors it becomes another bullet point in a long list of copes. It applying for individual families like OP isn't undermining/abusing their situation but my comment is providing context that Scale matters in this debate. We'll always have outliers of all form. In this very world lmaaaoooooooo, accepted range is 5 lpa to 25 lpa. Get out of ur shell, evaluate multiple factors I think you put a very valid point. Our genetics is suitable for only few sports. I have a genuine question though - does hockey require lower intensity than football? Because I remember in the early 2000s we were just dwindling down in rankings but our failure to qualify for Beijing Olympics was an alarm for the hockey federation... And since that there has been lot of investment in developing the sport (more astro turf surfaces, Odisha support, etc.) and by 2016 we were back in top 6 in the world. Why wasn't such turnaround possible for Football, which is similar to hockey in terms of basic objectives? >By that means rich countries should do better than us but that’s not the case. China and korea do better then us. They are richer Skateboarding. > Get out of ur shell saying the guy living in the very shell lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo No steaks Yeah, thats a good point, the opportunity and the facilities to explore are much better, true. Yeah, thats a good point, the opportunity and the facilities to explore are much better, true. Yes, 15 lakhs is middle class. You're incredibly stupid if you think earning 15 lakhs a month makes you a \"High class\" You're one google search away from walking away from this conversation a little wiser. If you think managing a household with 1-1.2 lakh and planning for savings and having emergency funds is enough, you're the one who's out of touch A factually incorrect one, but a jab nonetheless There are roughly 7-8% salaried people in India (assuming almost all people filing returns are salaried). Now let’s estimate number of small businessmen, shall we: These 7% would have families, say maybe 2-3 dependents per salaryman (parents, housewives, children). Taking 2 conservatively we have 21% India not eligible. We have 79% Indians left. But 55% of Indians do agriculture. So 24% left. Among them number of families would be 3 each with one person working. So at max 8% of Indian can be small businessmen. And this is neglecting small time informal jobs which are way more (daily wage, factory workers, gig workers). No way there are more shopkeepers than salaried in India. It just doesn’t compute. Progressive taxation lol, do you think Any govt can get Ambani and Adani to pay fair taxes lol. The reason we are seeing recent wealth transfers to Adani is the population has stopped voting on real issues, states where people vote for real issues are once again mostly homogeneous. Time won't change anything, India can't compete in the global economy, and getting billions to cooperate is not possible, so it's going to become worse only. It is doable Nothing will happen. One thing to consider is genetics. Body type truly matters. For example, West Africans descent comprise almost every sprinting event in the Olympics. Whites have longer torsos which are beneficial in sports like swimming and weightlifting. I'm just not sure the Indian genetics (small, slender, etc.) are better for most Olympic sports. It's genetics. People of West African descent are the fastest people on the planet. White people are better at other sports due to body type as well like swimming, weightlifting, throwing. Let’s mark the tweet then, I promise it will happen. I just don’t know when it will happen. Biggest challenge for India moving into future is going to be climate change. It’s absolutely going to ravage us and Bangladesh. why this Q comes up EVERY TIME the Olympics takes place. seen it in the past 4 times at least. Modi is like that meme of the man hiding begin a tree rubbing his hands Saina Nehwal explained like 12 years ago > 10M air rifle. useless \"sport\", non athletic. yeah lol * Sex yes i noted this. there is huge diaspora - take just the rich countries: US, UK - you hardly ever see desis in athletic sports beyond middle high school. i.e. animal protein deficiency, yep punctuation ffs Genetics After living in the UK, I understand why. India doesn't have a sports culture. In the countries which do well in sports, it's a way of life. Schools have multiple sports to chose from and teach them seriously. Parents socialise around kids school clubs and encourage kids to pick up sports seriously. British middle class bonds over sports. They don't brag about their car or kids test scores. They brag about which sports event they followed, what they know about it and how their kids played on weekend football. This and a super competitive and structure sports system ensures their is great quality coming out at the top end. India can invest millions in sports, but bring a few areas like Haryana, Punjab, NE and Goa, sports is largely a hobby for the rich or an escape from property for the poor. That will not make us champions. You are not wrong though after Abhinav no one has gotten a gold in this sport tbh which is a shame Indians are too confrontational, we can't develop, simply fighting over anything and everything, take the population control attempts, Bihar has openly not followed it and biharis claiming that they won't follow it and those who followed it are fools and it's their mistake to follow it, what can be done? well further proven by the fact all 3 current medals are in this useless \"sport\" True, hope we get a medal in hockey or javelin not jixing but badminton also. They are what I would call actual sports, funny its coming from a shooter myself but it is the bitter truth. True, hope we get a medal in hockey or javelin not jixing but badminton also. They are what I would call actual sports, funny its coming from a shooter myself but it is the bitter truth. Then why other rich nations are worse than India ? only way you can make me watch these shooting events is putting a real gun to my head If we send our army ppl with good shooting they can easily win lots of gold medal in shooting instead of depending on rich ass who can afford the gun managing to only win 3 bronze medal becoming legend of some sorts. \"army ppl\" ? \"easily\" ? LMAO let's not compare ourselves with a communist totalitarian regime, their athletes are more of an experiment subject... Or China is just a wealthier country with hard working people, some of whom make it to the top and win medals. Athletes are probably some of the most proud people. It's always the same excuse when India performs worse than China. \"Hur dur they're forced while we're democratic.\" Source: you made it up. The less idiotic/conspiratorial explanation is that it's a wealthier country with a cultural emphasis on education and hard work. It pays off. We as Indians our main focus during kids early years is to treat sports as a fun activity and not take it seriously. To all your above points, tell me one thing how many Indian origin athletes are represented from all the other nations. We have a huge Indian diaspora in US, UK, Canada and Australia but I don’t see a single Indian origin athlete represented from these countries. I also feel its to do with Genes to a certain extent especially for sports like swimming. what did I made up ??? Thats the point, for being an olympian you need hours and hours of training. That costs a shit load of money. The government does not help you with that. It’s easy to say there are facilities in college. How do you get admitted to the college, two ways either you are part of sports quota or you are academically good. To get through sports quota you need to be really good in that sport and that costs a lot of money. To give you an example for my daughter’s swimming class each 20-min semi private session costs $40 usd. Semi-private is 2 kids in a class. Private is $80 usd. Behind my daughter’s swimming we must have at least spent $10k usd. Then you go to competitive swimming where you go swim 2-3 times a week. The money really adds up. > their athletes are more of an experiment subject... Does anyone really care?! Every four years a few countries show off and the rest have to watch and rue the fact that they’re not up there because of different reasons. For the four years in between no one cares if you run fast, swim fast, throw darts or dribble better than others. Countries have bigger more existential problems that they should worry about instead of beating others in badminton. bruh this ain't even a topic to discuss, anyone with basic access to the internet knows how communist countries prepare their athletes, Soviet Russia, north Korea, China all run military level programs to create athletes, many of these kids who are turned into top athletes are deprived of a proper childhood just for the sake of countries' image.... If you cannot crack sports quota in college , you are aiming for Olympics ? Bruh saying \"it's not a topic to discuss\" doesn't make it true. This is you coping and making things up. Country that's considerably wealthier than India with a large population has a lot of medals, big whoop. ok... Such a great way to summarize. I never knew some of these facts. Because most of you guys are cricket fanatics. It's the most boring sport in the world after baseball. Watch some tennis, badminton or even swimming. I am really questioning the selection criteria of some Olympic players (with all due respect) India sent a 14 year old for olympics free style swimming who's speed/ level is basically between intermediate and advanced in an average city i live in EU. This tells us the sorry state of sports infrastructure. I think if she finds the right coach, she will really have a bright future. But this needs money and infrastructure and technology. The Tennis doubles indian team of Bopanna and Balaji were a joke. They lost straight sets to the French Team in an embarrassing way. It was such an embarrassing display of Tennis that even the ball boy couldn't stop laughing at some shots. I actually do play intermediate (obviously not as good) but can pick out technical flaws easily. And i just turned my tv off. Badminton is fine though, not much of an investment needed really. Wrestling is just a natural but just in one part of the country. Sports stars and not born but they are made through hardwork, persistence and determination. Stop brainless cricket hero worshipping like calling Tendulkar/Kohli a god. Go out play other sports and encourage people/ kids to play other sports. You will see changes in infrastructure as demand picks up. We aren't like china who can build things overnight. For us, it will take like 15-20 years maybe. OK. So a hundred years ago I was a district level swimmer and an age group cricketer. I pursued cricket (for a while). Why? Two reasons - sponsorship and fairness in selection. As a cricketer I played most of my career in Mumbai, where I'm from and came through the ranks. Selectors knew me, and numbers were hard to beat, and selections weren't all that ridiculous (just Mumbai, just back then). Swimming on the other had was horrible. Selection committees were exclusively political hires who either selected for a fee or selected family members, meaning teams were really mediocre. Nobody ever won anything. Through teammates I've followed the rest of their careers. Things haven't changed. Also, most often private sponsorship is stopped at district level. They either don't allow it, if ever it comes, or don't let thr money reach the player I don't know why shooting is in Olympics. I don't live in India right now but I don't think 15L would be top 5% in Mumbai and Bangalore. Most 15L earners would come from the big cities. Yeah even for some US team , Rapper Flavor Flav is sponsoring them coz they got no money for paying rent. > China is another overpopulated giant you should look into definition of \"overpopulation\", China has large population yes Fiji has 40% Indian population. Their entire rugby team is polynesian. Those guys are settled there for generations. India has the thirst most amount of billionares in the world. Why is everyone saying noone has enough money in india to create gold medal winners? Lack of sports scholarships is a big reason as well. If Indian universities gave out even a fraction of the number of sports scholarships as other countries, middle class families would start to see athletics as an investment for their children. Like provide evidence instead of claiming something and then saying \"it's not a topic to discuss\" when someone calls you out. Why even comment if that's your response lmao. Do you think athletes from other countries don't train their entire childhood or something? You don't just hop into a sport as an adult and compete at the Olympics. No wonder India has so few top athletes if your mentality is common. Why has Japan not produced any gold medalists in the 100m? They have the population, wealth and dedication, yet still can't make it. Why does Ethiopia dominate the 10,000m, even though it has malnutrition, poverty and corruption? Genetics. Populations have different average limb length, fat mass, muscle mass, etc. So some races are just more suitable for some sports than others. Indians have the worst genetics for sports. Indians are mediocre in every physical attribute. The best people we have are just average in other countries. India is not even a very impressive cricket nation. With 1.4 billion people, it barely succeeds against much smaller countries like Australia and South Africa. It is even worse considering Australia and SA have other sports like football, while India's only game is cricket. If cricket were more popular in other countries, India would be at the bottom, like it is in all sports. Plenty of other counties like New Zealand or Jamaica spend far less on Olympic programmes. You’ll find when a national hosts a games, they inject a huge amount of Money into their programmes and obviously send much larger teams like France are doing now. Just look at what happened in Archery. Why would you send back and disrespect a Korean coach who brought you to this level. Why give his position to a trainer. We are taught to respect our teachers but it looks like those in power are still playing their little greedy games. Until you name and shame the people in the Indian Olympics association this is not going to get fixed, I get but there system is more draconian moving kids forcing them on battle of the fittest and some ungodly stuff put into their bodies to make them ideal like literally they test every school by activating muscle of 7 years old to see if their glutes are activate and indian parent would be like what athelete Dr or engineer is better. India we don't have a system and also cannot force to be part of a program China they are richer but online there are murmur of their methods have come into question look at Russian athletes as well. America benifit be cause of their college system of doing things. 15 LPA is closer to top 10% than 5%. That's a 150 million people so it doesn't feel as rich. yeah. I mean look at the turkish pistol guy who is trending, he won silver medal and worked in army so his practice for shooting was managable as army provides you with the best coaches and best shooting facilities. Less lunatic rambling, more facts and evidence. I was looking at this the wrong way and feeling disappointed. Number of medal winners from 1.4 B pop was less, but if we look at no. of medal winners per no. of billionaires, its a nice number… feel good already /s This doping maybe a one of incident but still From recent performance it is consistency and lack of mental strength. >satisfied that we are at least better than Pakistan Toh kya ab pakistan se bura perform kare? /S Hockey has became a power game after some rule changes by the international hockey federation in the 80s, more than skill it is now a game of power and fitness. We excel in cricket because due to rule changes it is a batsmen game , there are 100 of restrictions on bowlers . Rohit sharma looking like a potato sack can become hitmen because rules favour batsmen ., talented bowlers like Shane bond had to suffer multiple injuries and loss of career because fast bowling demands fitness and they have severe restrictions when it comes to bowling If countries like U.S start calling the shots in cricket , it will become a baller game which means it would be a power game . Football is not like cricket, it demands more stamina than technique or skill. The Medium posts slaps hard, thanks for sharing! ♥️ I still cant understand whats the obsession with medals, a large portion of our country is still fighting for basics such as food shelter how is it expected from them to access the infrastructure that is required to compete at the top level. It is indeed one incident, and very different from your earlier claims that they have a \"scary obsession with Olympic\" or that they \"literally they test every school by activating muscle of 7 years old\". From your earlier comment, who actually cares about online murmurs? Do you have any idea what the average online murmurs are like about India? You wouldn't like it. But it doesn't matter, online murmurs aren't important nor do they say anything about the truth. Btw if you look at the number of Olympic disqualifications and stripped medals, an actual statistic rather than an anecdote like you linked, China doesn't look bad at all for a country that brings hundreds of athletes to the Olympics. China has 4 stripped medals, the US 10, and Russia 46. Goes to show that comparing China to Russia is a joke. India is also worse than China if you look at doping. Let's again look at a statistic instead of one incident. *India has emerged as the country with the highest percentage of doping offenders, according to the 2022 testing figures released by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The report revealed that out of 4,064 samples collected from Indian athletes (including urine, blood, and athlete biological passports), 127 individuals tested positive for banned substances, constituting 3.26 per cent of the sample size.* *India's doping violations outnumber those of major sporting nations such as Russia (85), the United States (84), Italy (73), and France (72). China conducted the highest number of samples testing - 17,357 during the counting period - with an adverse findings percentage of 0.25 per cent.* > They won bronze at the last Olympics. They are on an upswing **due to a tremendous amount of investment into it** Exactly my point. You invest in it, medals might come as a side effect. > Olympics are the pinnacle of the sports that are there Olympics are the pinnacle of fleecing host countries by a deeply sleazy body that is outmatched in corruption only by FIFA. Same with Fiji. Formal salaried folks are extremely low in number. Informal, yes that would be huge but no taxes there. Bro why you asking us middle class? You want us to earn 15LPA, pay taxes and also play sports? Pagal hai Kya? Sports and fitness needs to be in way of life and culture to push the government to prepare infrastructure and produce great athletes. We lack that at the moment. I live in Netherlands and I can see people in every age group (right from a baby who has just learned to walk to someone in 90s) are into some or other kind of fitness activity. Their infrastructure and training academies are amazing. Their schools play great part in making them better, if not schools, there are sports centers who do exactly that. I hope we as a country will reach there someday. Second very important part that not a lot of people talk about is gene pool. Our ancestors were settlers in the most “easy to live” part of the world (I am talking about thousands of years back). Our bodies did not develop much for harsh conditions. On top of that Indian diet is not the most nutritious in the world (when it comes to superior athletics), lack of protein, high carbs makes us way weaker than the countries that have protein rich diets. Brij Bhushan like people across sports bodies are responsible for girls getting discouraged to participate in sports. Just being curious, how come private college in the USA has such amazing facilities? Is it from the beginning? Or has it evolved over time? Many Govt colleges in India have a lot of good facilities but that's because they could get land for cheap. For private colleges, sports ranks lower in their priority list. > their family's money to fund their dreams in inital stages. And politicians would scoop down to take credit and gift tax payers money as if it's their money. STATED FACTS!! > Instead of the Olympics, if a good opportunity came across the parents' way for their son to get into the IPL, would Indian parents do whatever was needed to come up with the financial resources? They will try for every opportunity for their children. Olympics is once in four years event. While IPL more frequent with lot more opportunities in various teams. Also there seems to be lot more money for cricket in India. At times I do feel like ambanis and adanis should step up to help our athletes, it's the best they can do not to mention everyone wants india to place and win medals but most of those people also don't want their own kids to do anything except studies...even if the kid is talented in a sport, they'll be forced to give it up to focus on 10th, 12th, and so on...can't have your cake and eat it too Exactly - just imagine how many billions Modi would pump into the system if India was awarded an Olympic Games🤔 The cost of entry to some sports is way too high in India - which is why cricket and football are so popular. There are athletes like Neeraj and Mirabai Chanu but you either need rich benefactors or government help (like the Aussie Institute of Sport) to get to the Olympics. Nz and Jamaica are outliers. Nz has a strategic outlook to medalling. They prioritise their funds to higher medal prospects. There was a criticism that other sports don’t grow because of this. For eg their rowing teams get a lot of the budget. They have less money and they are smart about using it to get max medals. Jamaica is entirely a track and field giant. Both these countries have the highest medal per capita. I lived in nz for 5 years, they have decent sporting facilities at the grassroots level. Baseline is that it still costs money to get medals. Larger economies can spend a lot but there is a huge cost to a medal. That’s again a feeling because we don’t see outside our bubbles. 60% of Mumbai lives in slums. One can safely say they don’t earn more than 15 lakhs a year. The definition of middle class is quite interesting. Is it an economically secure family with basic needs met, a vehicle, kids going to college? Or is it the middle of the pyramid? none of that have much to do with it. forget 50% even if 90% are malnourished, the remaining 10% is still bigger than a lot of countries that do top Olympics so we do have the numbers on our side, we are also about the youngest country to we also have age on our side. personal beliefs don't affect your ability to compete in Olympics, essential infrastructure for being an athlete is a gym and internet so yeah we do have essential infrastructure. with the numbers we have, things like casteism, corruption and sexual abuse will still very much not impede our ability to top in Olympics. The actual reason actually isn't malnutrition but a lack of balanced diet, you becoming an athele means you are going to have to train a lot your average vegetable simply can't provide the amount of energy and other required not to mention the sheer amount of things you won't find in a vegetable (this is actually the main reason for a lot of widespread n india) you need meat and not just chicken meat but all kinds of meat and top quality at that the kind that will make your family disown you. And then comes the expenses, you need a diet plan made by best dieticians in the world and have to follow it 24/7 + you will also need a coach which means becoming an athlete ie very expensive and you won't have much pay if you did become one due to lack of market unless it's cricket. Did they emigrate and lose the amazing Indian capacity to reproduce ? India should get out of this low cost mentality in everything. Why can’t we have best athletes at high cost? Why not have ISRO launch high-cost missions ? Rampant casteism in selection process? Do you mean the upper caste? Because upper caste are hardly there, most of the sportsmen come from Northern states, like Haryana and Punjab. And they stay on the merit. So how is it about casteism.. yep, I read somewhere that Indian athletes in Paris is eating Dal-Chawal :) You hve to evaluate smething called cost and ease of living. This analogy goes like \"Oh 300 people died, you guys only lost ur hand, u r pretty normal\" you people need to really figure out how much money it actually takes to live decently. Because the PE period in school always gets replaced with Maths period. >Your ignorance is showing So long as my man boobs are not Like? Written by none other than the Suraj Yengde. It's thanks to a few guys like him out there than the West is learning about Ambedkar, and the history of various social justice movements in India. When the affluent brahmins emigrated to the US in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, they did their due diligence in wrongfully painting an image of all Indians as cow worshipping, vegetarians -- the simson's Apu. And those who penetrated academia did their best to keep Ambedkar's name out of their analysis and textbooks. It's only recently, with more and more Dalits and OBCs emigrating that Western academics are learning about the rich history of our struggle against casteism. I mean… it’s quite obvious why A quick look through the medals tally in any of the past Olympics will show plenty of 3rd world developing countries above India. Most of these countries follow a pattern and win in a small number of specific events (Jamaica: track & field etc.) If India had a more calculated approach and injected funds into a small number of sports we would prolly still get more medals than we do now. Lol. Right? I was like \"am I poor?\"😭 . Okay just checked my bank balance and I am definitely poor and not in middle class anymore. Incredible India! where in guwahati? Railway colony maligaon Disagree, China had very similar per-capita gdp and population in 1984 olympics. They won 32 medals and were placed 4th while india won ZERO medals that year All the things you listed happen with other poor African and Caribbean nations, but they still routinely win medals and have top runners in the world. It's more then just that culture and genetics play a factor Because we’re poor country? Yea. And no aspirations."
