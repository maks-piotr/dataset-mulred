Just like quota system ?\n\nBJP absolutely did nothing regarding the Bangladesh border, now saying they need NRC after letting illegal people come to India, you really think indeginous people will tolerate ? This will cause hate in both community.\n\nBJP can fix almost most of the things but they choose not to do unless election time, it's like people of India forget so better not show their cards, show it one by one during dire need.\n\nWe are in dire need of healthy opposition who need to raise the right questions.",

The riff-raff bottom trash of a nation wide gangster organization. Depends upon the side you are in state sponsored thugs Go gta on them bro We need Selmon bhoi nowüíÄ the amount of time i feel scared by their presence is insane, these are boys who are usually from middle to lower class houses, with no faith or an identity, hence they join these kind of herd and think they are contributing towards something. the worst thing is they are weaponised, extremely, and a single offence to them can lead towards your death. they are extremely scary, vile, and often creeps too Only if Gods could speak Wow can't you give yr life for Hindu rashtra ? lol Very well put! Wow Respect for Selom bhoi üíØ Channel Your Inner Selmon Bhai and Blame it on them ! Terrible I am wondering if you will do the same to the others Yassss I am not racist man I hate all of them What! Bhai kuch hua kya gaadi ko? Ya apke aapko bacha liya? (Genuine) But realistically, one jacked up gym bro is enough for all of them. How much damage can you even do with twigs. In the long run the imbeciles from both sides Muslims and Hindus will gain nothing and their lives will be a total waste because they are so drunk on religion they won‚Äôt do anything for betterment of themselves or their family so in a way i pity them it‚Äôs the educated and well off people who have similar mindset or ideology worries me. Very astute observation Rebels usually have a cause and aims. These are just thugs. üéµThey not like u/s This one is just potent without an omni They have to exist for that What does this have to do with scientific temperament? Welp! Time for lifelong prison/death sentence. kbhi tajia pe ghar se bahar niklo Which organisation do they belong to? Yeah I can't believe they were randomly hitting cars and people weren't doing shit. You seriously underestimate the power of a stick. This is why politicians want to play the religion card all the time while the loot the fuck out of every indian institution and leave the middle class to go pray for food Don't forget the Christian terrorists in the North East! Wait till you will witness Islamists mob like Bangladesh Oh really, so you're calling to murder innocent people... I hope police takes a note You're a Hater with bad ideas üò° GTA is not all about murda man. lmao why you people have to bring islam everytime in equation when theres talk about hindu mobs? yeah yeah im sorry there wont be 'islamist' mobs in a country that is saffronised through hindutva Same happens during Muharram Now say that to Khalsa's carrying swords or muslims carrying sticks during Muharram. As much as you hear shit on news, pointlessly calling group names would rile them up. This arrogance alone fuels people to hold their believes even closer. Ye muslim or hindu ke extremists na hote toh accha rehta life peaceful x100 jati False, Don't blame every Kanwar group \"Ye saala bahut aage jaayega\" . . . . . . . . . . . . Mera matlab Jail muharram happens once in a year (or twice, idk) and khalsa also happens rarely, and they are both done for religious purposes, and you will ever, rarely hear them threatning or klling anyone. h*nd* mobs have klled and thrashed people way too much, this is not arrogance level. these people are often out in mobs, if you live in north india specially UP you will know how nuisance they have created Dharam k terrorist Yeah I agree and people who don‚Äôt understand and accept this fact are living a delusional life. I just can‚Äôt bear it when BJP seeks refuge in the name of patriotism or religion and Congress is not too far behind, they do the same shit in the name of social justice and equality so basically we are screwed and India is creating more political zombies. Stop livinh under a rock. i think you replied the wrong person You need to have his resources as well. If not for his social standing in his own case would be stuck in the aching judiciary‚Äôs backdoors. But boi got clean chit in the eyes of non-biological. nice try, I love my life, I will not take any baits! Let's not forget why majority of them actually join üö¨üçÅ This happens almost every year in Thane Maharashtra During Janmastami as these guys are in a large group there is lots of intimidating and eve teasing. I remember I was with my sister and there was a kid maybe in 9-10 grade passing sexual comments. He only did it as it was a group would not have balls to do it otherwise. Exactly they are what brown army was to Nazis Beneath their hooliganism, I see a total lack of awareness and - quite ironically - malnutrition, which should tell you exactly where India fucks up its priorities. Whenever I see these mobs I get scared They are capable of horrifying violence. And I am a Hindu. Joblessness is the main culprit Sticks and Stones make them barbarians. Gangsters wear suit and use guns. I have seen in movies. Nah that‚Äôs not the only time they use it, remember kanhaiya lal from bhilwara rajasthan ? Rebels require you to be against a system. These goons are supported by the system. They are nothing but a semi marshal extremist faction meant to flex religion and state muscle I still remember muharram processions the first time I saw it I was traumatised, was so scared can‚Äôt even- Pata nahi bhai bhajrang dal abb bramahan ko bhi marene lag gayi hai kya pata do din baad yea mandir mea jake Murti hata de Just shows you how much education can change a person. These poor chaps don't reason or challenge any superficial facts spouted by their leaders. Please educate yourselves about morals,religion,codes,society,etc. If these people had a tiny bit of critical thinking, they would be crying themselves to sleep every night thinking about how they behaviour affect others like in OP's picture. Educate yourself and hopefully others too. Perfect observation peaceful peaceful religion karte rehte kuch to sikh lete us peaceful religion se bsdwl Yes so truw..these fukers gather every friday and do randome shit on roads parks and what not Great observation üëç Can someone give context? I am not from India. Who are these and what are they doing law and order is joke in this county Every morning I go out for walk with a stick. Damn never knew I was a gangster. Some time it lead to accident due to such action Reminds me of that scene in Derry Girls where Claire's family tries to drive through the Orange March by Protestants - except this is much scarier. Let me put it here before someone drags Muslims/Islam here as usual - Pagan obsession of Islam represents their deep rooted insecurity and lack of faith. The hatred is nothing but fear and survival mechanism which stems from intellectual bankruptcy, lack of understanding of Islam and especially lack of a strong faith in their own beliefs and Gods. They are more prone to gravitating towards Islam once they decide to gain actual knowledge beyond propaganda than the an average Hindu who is driven with faith than hatred against other religion. Carrying out a religious yatra is within the constitutional rights it does not make anyone gangster Idk why people are downvoting it was personal experience rather I should say traumaüòîüòî üòÇüòÇ Crowd has no face!!! In a crowd everyone becomes gangster this implies to any and every crowd Inke saath rajat dalal ko bhidado In india, people respect who has the bigger stick. Brandish an automatic rifle infront of them and watch them scatter. Its not a question about who is right or wrong, or rights and duties. I don't think they are from middle class. Middle class boys and girls have incentives to try and improve their financial condition. They won't waste much time in this shit. I guess they are from middle lower class to lower/poor ass families. They need a sense of pride. So this becomes a sense of pride for them. I wonder if thier parents are equally violent or not. The former. They aren't rebelling against anything. They think they are but they're not. If they were you'd see fewer issues in the country by now. Everything. This has reached a point where something as silly as beef consumption is considered to be a reason for cow vigilantes to murder people. Anyone with decent scientific temperament wouldn't even think this way. Some of the greatest scientific minds throughout history have all questioned religious practices that are absurd. No one with scientific temperament would ever keep religion as their top priority outside the 4 walls of their house. ...and paw paw has the biggest gun ! I... Wait... Are you the Nazis in this situation? That's the funniest part. It's sad people won't know in the end there is no God. What they could've done during their lifetime is practice what they believe within the confines of their own lives, places of worship and house. But no. They won't do that. lets be honest, I see naive and ill advised young citizens. We talk about Brain Drain into foreign countries while half of them end up like what we can see here. Reading the comments on this thread I feel a liitle comforted to see so many sensible like minded Indians voice their opinion. Religion as we all know is opium for the masses & sadly in India the 'addiction' is worsening. So even though India might be improving its GDP numbers & becoming an economic powerhouse...is it really progressing at the grassroots level?? nope, you can‚Äôt generalize all chuslims as terrorists but you can generalise all kanwars as gangsters NEVER underestimate the strength of mobs that can go wild. Off-topic, but this is similar to [pack of stray dogs that attack and maul people - like the recent story in Bengaluru](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sYgeubhPkyQ) Didn‚Äôt some BJP guy beat the [shit](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/bjp-up-kanwariyas-muslims-police-9547584/) out of some hooligan kanvariyas just this week? I mean how does one even confuse a group of orange people with Muslims? (Not implying actual Muslims should be beaten up)‚Ä¶ People are just commenting, when they see safron clothes, taking their preconceived perception. Some of people that I know attend this kavad, this are some of the best people I know, careing,humble and helpfull. The people that are front and back carrying sticks guide traffic sometimes they may obstruct traffic, which is wrong, apart from that I find no problem in above photo. This is called self protection, there are many incidents where stone pelting happens, I am not justifying this but this is the reason. And now it's cyclic you can't blame one to throw stones and one to use a stick. BJP call themselves hindu party but they are not, they did not provide any type of protection during hindu festivals. No changes in old rules Temples and land donated are in gov clutches, often misused by gov Now BJP is crying over WAQF board but many does not know BJP is the one who made WAQF more powerful. If you give benefits to one community donyou really think anyone will give up ? Just like quota system ? BJP absolutely did nothing regarding the Bangladesh border, now saying they need NRC after letting illegal people come to India, you really think indeginous people will tolerate ? This will cause hate in both community. BJP can fix almost most of the things but they choose not to do unless election time, it's like people of India forget so better not show their cards, show it one by one during dire need. We are in dire need of healthy opposition who need to raise the right questions. Idk about UP, Come to Maharashtra especially in Marathwada region you will find more big kawad than this, like the other guy mentioned this guys belong to very lower middle class OBC families they usually work under political leaders this is their high time to show up Subhuman trash, no life no money no joy so they engaged in this short of shit to escape from life kind of like modern day \"Opium of the masses\" My pet dog got a life better than them, good food, good lodging heck even a medical attention when they fall sick which those things will never get in their miserable life. Walking barefoot in religious procession They had to become like this for several reasons. As long as you are not wearing orange clothes even with gun you are not a gangster. In Bihar, we have this Kanwar yatra of 110km approx. Don't think others face similar issue as government have made seperate route for 90% of journey and for 10% we have seperation between road, which I have seen people following without being GUNDAS. As a Muslim, this really scares me. Even if they do not have such intentions, they are becoming stereotyped, similar to what Muslims have been facing because of terror attacks around the world. Kabhi itni taarif ram navmi wale din pathar fekne walon ki kaar dia kaar , Saar tan se juda pe aap kha hote hai janab , mahuram , bakra eid slaughter they didn't even throw anything on your vehicle and they let u pass by giving u aside still they are Gunda what about you spitting shit on social media about anything u need .... all are potential rapists It's not that deep bro... We hate u because the moment u gain substantial numbers u try to kill every minority left right centre ... And if someone reverts back u claim to be victim They always behave rudely on the road Skull cap with a bomb is also for his self protection bro This is hindu terrorism, these pictures created bad effect on our hindu community! Just be proud for your religion, u don't need food, you don't need money for basic facilities. Let your hate for others feed and satisfy you. Same bro I feel shit scared during Muharram processions as well See the downvotes and understand that no one can be wrong except the hindus Pick any one of them for a one on one fight, let‚Äôs see who actually is malnourished, that‚Äôd be fun üòÜ No one did anything they just saw a bunch of people wearing orange and felt scared Haan bhai Muharram ki tarh hi toh hai ye? Model state is modeling under vin ghaslet raj. Bhai hindu hai toh wrong hi hoga... Muslims road block krke namaz bhi kre toh shi rehta, Sikhs sword carry kare wo bhi theekh rehta hai >[Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1f9hhpn/comment/lllwne5/) by[u/Better-Jury-2782](https://www.reddit.com/user/Better-Jury-2782/) from discussion in[india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/) See this, People posting on reddit are likely to be at least middle class . But you can see the mentality Bhai muslims good hindus bad ye kab sikhenge aap What even, is this mindset BJP has no idea of law and order. LOL. North India is going down the drain. I am sure, man. But we need to work towards getting rid of these. Its not helping anyone or any religion. Exactly! If they could, then also they would abhor what they are doing. Mahadev is an extremely patient god mostly. He is pleased with less and doesn‚Äôt condone whatever these guys are doing in the name of Kanwar yatra Money Channel: TG-@CLUB1697 üòÇ You mean the people whose homes and churches are being burnt down by the Hindus? whose women are being paraded naked by Hindu men? Right they are the terrorists in this scenario. Based guys, doing God's work in keeping investments away from UP The end up being tools and manipulated and they realise this in their old age but by then it's all too late. They are just like bees. Just prick one others spread to attack without knowing reason. Just maintain distance. this happen when your parents didn't tell you any thing about this Kavad yatra . If you are from other religious the n i am sorry it is not your problem There is some psychology behind it. More than often these are absolute cowards on their own. So if you are ever in a confrontation with them, pick one guy and try to beat the ever living shit out of him, others will most likely freeze The reason for the majority of them to actually want intoxicants is because their life sucks and use these as an escape. The bigger problem is the population being so poor, youth not having any jobs etc etc. You are missing the point completely. They might defeat any of us in a street fight. The point is that there is a high possibilty that their strength and brain power will not be used for anything that will contribute toward the development of our country and the world. Totally ..the goons .. The facy that you consider a persons ability to fight to be a parameter of health explains exactly what is wrong with this nation. orange ***IS*** the new black Kya bhai pehle pata karle kya hota fir gyan pelena honestly though, nothing scares me like the colour orange these days. hindutva has made it a colour of fear and terror! Running over hindutva fascists is not only morally justified, it is also incredibly satisfying. I hope the same comment goes for peaceful community too üòÖ‚Ä¶. Who are displaying their peaceful gestures all over Europe and other parts of world. Peace to WOKE people üòÇ Why so Anti Nasnal saar /s Where is selmon when we need him the most /s It give them some.sense of belonging and a goal They are the new terror sensation with JSR being their go to slogan. Atleast they are better than the gundas who throws stonesü§°üíÄ. Aa jao congress walo gyan dene üòÇ Lack of awareness is not something I would say they have as they know impunity and enjoy it. India has turned its dividend of a large, young, able bodied demographic into a catastrophe of uneducated/poorly educated, underemployed, malnourished young people with no moorings in the present or hope for the future. They don‚Äôt know shit about their religion, they are just following the herd. r/angryupvote They're going to assault him!!! Indeed, they are the ones raising \"Sir tan se juda\" slogans everywhere Beautifully written ü•π These skinny guys will be the first to leave the battlefield if war ever break out with.. say China. And those of us called Anti national would be at the forefront to defend it. We fought the British and we will fight others as well in future. And chaddis will support the enemy, as always. History repeats .... Yup, you won‚Äôt expect these clowns in Japan. Ik buddy . Ik they are cowards. If they had balls they‚Äôd not lick boots of the same mughls/british/ post independent congress govts/indira gandhis emergency congress etc . Thats what they do, the lick to survive. Do one side‚Äôs violence to put others down. If there ever was a two way fight, these jokers would run to save their hide. COWARDICE is a generational trait Whatsapp university gyan. How many have you seen people of such description? I bet none in all your small teenage life Yeah. Many such gangster families. Any long religious procession should be banned. I believe even if there were enough jobs through some miracle, these people wouldn't be able to secure one lol I mean, if you‚Äôre starving, it‚Äôs easier to find comfort in religion and then you can say it‚Äôs upavasam True. But also, the lack of awareness towards this. They don't have life goals or are not aware of it. The ecosystem around them makes them concentrate on this religion, Hindu Muslim, us vs them. If these people someday woke up and realised, that politicians used religion for their use and they didn't get anything. In a country where farmers protesting corporations are seen as terrorists but these are peaceful religious attendees. These people need to get a job Terrorists Just like any other terrorist camp Exactly, If they had hope for their future they wouldn‚Äôt be doing this. How are you so sure about that, that‚Äôs some nazi level stereotyping. Many of those will go on to great colleges and universities, and go on to get good posts in good organization. This, I am not stereotyping but sure about it, as I have also completed Kanwad yatra after my 12th class with many of my friends and We all are doing way better than many. üêè them wtf is the ‚Äúbrown army‚Äù are you talking about brown shirts ?? the stormtroopers ??? be clear because you‚Äôve called them the ‚Äúbrown army‚Äù like they were brown ppl and that‚Äôs why the person below has asked the q like they are so confused Atleast this is far better than the 'JACKET' boy Don't forgot religion is one hell of a drug too Great comment Care to explain?? How come it is wrong with the nation?? The guy looked at their frail figure and passed a judgement that they are malnourished, so, a frail body isn‚Äôt a malnourished body, I can show you obese people with a battery of malnourishment. See bro, I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with the nation but there is definitely wrong with stereotyping nazi pigs. people whose passing by are with their cars, are brave But they will harm people minding their own businesses. Nope, time and again we have seen that the fire of hatred spares none. Recent example of that Mishra boy killed by \"gau sevaks\" or whatever they call themselves. They are terrorists and jobless. Plain and simple Ohh definitely this is Hindu terrorism. Fuck them! We can only feel safe during Muharrram procession. It's a mob at most That's why, I always keep a Indian billhook with me in my car, ALWAYS. Shows clearly that politicians are winning.., brain washing works.., I meant Brownshirts I should‚Äôve been clearer. Thanks for clarifying. Lot of middle class people do pilgrimage and kanwad yatra, I being one of them whi went along with 11 of my friends. It is a spiritual experience walking across the country and meeting people from all walks of life, I met a guy from sonipat who was well to do and rich. People stereotype kanwariyas as poor and uneducated because the way they look, they wear simple saffron clothes and seem frail, poor and tired because of the long treacherous walk. The fact is Lot of poor people go on this pilgrimage but many of them are middle class and rich as well. Send them to border to defend the nation and see how they come running back to their Mommy Also all desperately seeking love, sex and touch. If you wanna run the Muharaam argument then that shit runs for a day. These chewtiyas occupy city roads and highways for entire month and are a public nuisance. He wouldn‚Äôt be feeling very gangsta in America with a stick. Yet if their moms or aunties caught them, they'd cower from the wrath those women would give them Need some context please‚Ä¶who are they? And why have I seen so many videos of them destroying cars on twitter? Do you hv guts to the post the pics of real one‚Äôs who behead people for no reason just becoz it is like cutting vegetable for thm I know, but not in a way these intoxicants work on your brain. These incite chemical processes in your brain to subside pain. Or maybe it's me and I don't know how religion works. Yes! Same kind of scene I have seen while muharram tajiya are happening..!! Goons are everywhere.! Isn‚Äôt it? Yes! Same kind of scene I have seen while muharram tajiya are happening..!! Goons are everywhere.! Isn‚Äôt it? Hideous hooligans That's why we need Allah. Come to Isla m >Many of those will go on to great colleges and universities Press (X) to doubt Gonna see more of this in near future ig, especially when the Central Govt is on that side Faith has nothing to do with it. People with faith persecute and kill for stupid reasons Lower and middle class OBCs are the foot soldiers of the Hindutva project. Yeah the same thing is happening from the other side as well, you thing the Christian are the victims? Open your biased blindfold Brain drain to the West and brain death here Waiting for a post on Islamic Terrorism. Oh wait that's happening from many many decades but people don't have the balls to call it Islamic Terrorism because Terrorism doesn't have any religion correct? Stop this hypocrite behaviour. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX Sometimes it hurts to listen and see these pictures and comments, when me and my cousin go for ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§µ‡§∞ , we all walk on the roadside , not doing these types of extra irrespective things . Nowadays all these become fashion or a type of joy not a sacrosanct prayer. Indeed! Very astute one might even claim ******phobia immediately after skimming through the words! Shhh. You are being far right now In 1975, a compulsory sterilization program was introduced by then Prime Minister Mrs Indira Gandhi, so that Indian Citizens of India do not have to come across such items on streets of the nation. Owaisi Bhai..... Real ID me aayiye I could be wrong but holding a danda is part of the procession I think What about muslims who block the road and pray‚Ä¶bet u dont feel they are like gangstersüòÇüòÇüòÇ Islamic terrorism is obvious thing, terrorism is related to islam, but as a hindu I don't want my religion become one face of terrorism. Classic r/india post. Peaceful religious walk. Our country is ruined by religion. And it won't become, and it will not become, because people don't support this kind of processions. Like they are blocking roads, playing heavy base music that too at night, and more importantly causing problems for ordinary Hindus like us. We don't support this kind of shit and nowhere in the Vedas it's written to blast music with full bass and go bonkers on road to please Mahadev. ‡§Ö‡§∂‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡§æ ‡§≠‡§∞ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§≤‡§£‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ‡§µ‡§° ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§†‡•á ‡§™‡§π‡§ø‡§≤‡•Ä, ‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§†‡§µ‡§æ‡§°‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡§ß‡•Ä ‡§™‡§π‡§ø‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§®‡§æ‡§π‡•Ä. ‡§∏‡§ó‡§≥‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•á ‡§ì‡§¨‡•Ä‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ç‡§® ‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡§æ‡§§ ‡§π‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§µ‡§à‡§∂‡•ã‡§ß ‡§ï‡•Å‡§†‡•Ç‡§® ‡§≤‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§£? I wish someone just goes bonkers and runs a SUV over them. Nahi Funny how it's only people following Hinduism that keep investment away. üôÇ What the hell did he do to you to even consider him a gangster?? And let me tell you why that danda is for. I live in Mumbai. We were walking towards Shirdi and I saw with my eyes how padyatras are treated by so-called elite car owners. I had a group member killed by a truck in daylight while going to Shirdi and the worst part is the truck did even stop and the truck driver was never caught even after FIRs and what not. Hence, now padyatries have started to use danda. Jain's yatra, Buddhist yatra and many more hire men for safety or keep dandas while waking. It always feels good to sit in an ac car and lecture the world when you don't even know the truth. I‚Äôm sorry, but we shouldn‚Äôt assume that only middle-class or lower-middle-class people are involved in something like this. The perspective feels privileged. Many educated and well-off individuals have been responsible for some of the most heinous tragedies. I‚Äôm not trying to call you out or anything, but it feels necessary for all of us to change this mindset. More like bullies. Yeah I agree the \"Hindutva project\", is more likely a vote bank Reddit kangaroo court assemble. Gang gang survival is the cause cause others are doing the same even tho they are in minority For every group of terrorists there will be group of gundas. Terrorists is a threat to the whole nation but yet people have problem with them only the privilege class is the one dominating these people. you wont see modi and yogi or anyone lavishly living in their house going on their street, but support them. the whole goon culture is endorsed by the privileged themselves, but they often dont come to the street and do this. why are you seeing my comment as a stereotype? every class participate in different ways, its just that these kind of mob culture, most participants are from middle to lower class. Still better than , beheading an old man in broad daylight Kon manhe \"mahina bhar chal na ri kawad ??????\" Ani \"karyakarte\" hya shab da cha prayog mi kuthe kel aadhi mala kalva mag mi tumhala ‡§ú‡§æ‡§µ‡§à‡§∂‡•ã‡§ß ‡§ï‡•Å‡§†‡•Ç‡§® ‡§≤‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤‡§æ he sangto Varkari are good people. I never felt threatened by them. And I never heard complaints. thats not faith Can someone be so kind and help a clueless European understand what is happening there? I apologise you sir, I didn't mentioned Varkari, yeah indeed they are good people infact they are the one who follow pure religious rituals and practices in a way that everyone should follow the OP describes some teen guys who acts like gangster or try to show rowdy nature under kawad yatra I am talking about this chapri goons Those people that go to other countries also become extremely conservative for some reason. They cling to their religion and caste like they are life jackets. Yes, but why? I feel like the middle class and lower middle class have become everyone‚Äôs punching bag. For someone who has actually grown up in a slum, there‚Äôs a reason for this. There‚Äôs no hope. You see people around you struggle every day, and you‚Äôre filled with rage. The system is designed to keep you there. There are no good schools, hospitals, or even toilets. There‚Äôs no dignity in being born, living, or even dying. You witness all of this and are just angry I suppose. Then, they misguide that rage. Again, please don‚Äôt take this as an attack. My point is that there are more nuanced layers to this. A blanket statement like that does nothing but spread more hate. great now people just walking have become gundas and what have they done wrong by having a danda in their hand the walk for 100s of km and they sometime need it as a walking stick sometime to scare off stray animals ... ohh but no... they are hindu thats why they are gunda...... great observations everyone if in Nuh a horde of mob showers rocks over normal guys on road then they are no gunda but some people just walking are gundas XD i did point out in my comment..that theres less of faith, hope, an identity to relate to, deprivation and so much. that being said- what makes indian lower and middle class unique is also a huge variation in their cultural and political prefrences. idk why are you conducting that im spreading hate even though you agree with me as well, im just pointing out that political extremism in this country in weaponised form comes from those whom the system mostly fails. it is sad, it is not my rage Owaisi bhai visionary hai. India‚Äôs per capita will be of a developed nation with 25 crore population If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre trying to say, then I‚Äôm sorry, my bad. Wait until you see real gangster holding knives and shouting STSJ, but that post will never see the light of the day on the sub. So for now I will assume that this is the most extremism India has faced in the past 5 years. Naming someone without knowing or understanding is a fashion I suppose. Most of our urban youth are out of touch of their own culture. They only know CNN, Netflix etc culture‚Ä¶pity Some of my Hindu 12th class friends are karyakarta for bjp all middle class one of them even booked for attempted murder this year Not terrorist .. they shout something else before blasting ‚úåÔ∏è It's all a vicious circle, more nutrition leads to higher IQ. This helps a lot of people to go to college and independent thought. Lower IQ people are easier to manipulate and more susceptible to propaganda. It's a vicious cycle. Can‚Äôt name them as ‚Äúreligious gundas‚Äù. People who actually follow religion, do not indulge in stupidity. Let it be hinduism, islam, sikhism or Christianity, people who claim themselves to be the so called flag bearer of religion, in reality, are the ones who are farthest away from the very basic ideals of the religion. Disposables. I‚Äôm a Muslim and I call for it to be banned. I just feel that these people don't know shit about religion all they care about is how to gain fame and power and crush and suppress others As a Hindu I am really ashamed of these people Some will abuse me , but really do these guys even pray or have ethics because I don't remember carrying weapons like this is needed in a highway even if u say self defence Mai kuch nhi bolu ga U should be thankful these are sticks not ak 46 and swords. Yaha sab Gyan chodne sa jaate hai. Ye ek dharm ke khilaf nafrt phelana nhi hai üòÇ Strange, that you didn't click their pictures while you \"saw\" them *using* their dandas. And they are not showing up suddenly this is called a rally it does not have a teleport ability of this magnitude. Hope you farmed sufficient karma though. :) I‚Äôd be happy if Muharram procession is banned. I‚Äôm a Muslim. Just what we need to keep the other herd in check you can cry all about feeling unsafe but when the roles are switched you people will not even acknowledge it let alone condemn it Terrorists Idiots are those who post like this shit. What if you go somewhere on the highway. Won't you try to be safe ? Or anyone can run their vehicle on you or if you are with your family members on highways do you not try to keep them safe ü§°ü§° Yes but please also mention what Muslim majority countries have done to their minorities. Neither is right, both are in the wrong. I feel multiple countries would behave differently towards Islam if Muslims didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúwe are right and others wrong attitude‚Äù. The attitude isn‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs the violence that has ensued for millennia as a result of that attitude. Again, this goes for everyone, not trying to single out Islam but just trying to hopefully convey to you that nobody can cry victim, when everyone has blood on their hands (some more than others but not the point). wo gunda nhi wo bas car and bike walo ko side kar rhe hai wo koi patthar nhi fek rhe hai toh religious gunda ya kuch mat bola karo jo patthar fekte hai uske bare me bolne ki himmat nhi hai teri All religions are fucked up but some are more fucked up than the others . Cameraman - modern Indian pussy Labourers who work daily for long hours might be physically stronger but many of them would be malnourished. Strength doesn't necessarily translate into good nourishment. XXXXX They don't belong to a reserved caste, at least. I saw kavariyas eating gutka , spitting everywhere, no civics sense, using vulgar words to each other loudly in front of school kids . Fuck these assholes, mahadev should open his third eye and burn these bhakti asses. This is kind of biased i think, all year you could run into a much more violent group of wedding goers but kawad is pretty much limited to one month a year, however you will see them at any time... Just give them their space on the road, it's theirs as well as yours... If you're close enough for one of them to hit your car then you're probably driving too close to them and trying to use your vehicle to move them out of the way... They are people not a group of buffalo. Getting too close for you means a dent in your car but getting too close for them means a broken foot or leg. I'm saying this as someone who has done kanwar yatra from haridwar to Delhi as well as dak kanwar from haridwar to Kashipur.... These are not groups of thugs but people that are walking 30+40 km a day in the heat and are tired of people trying to crush them while they drive by in the ac.... ‚ÄúPatriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.‚Äù This phrase fits them perfectly. This religious nationalism has given all these low life unemployed losers and thugs a false sense of pride. They‚Äôre no different from Islamic thugs. Absolutely, they‚Äôre just ignoring real problems , similar to Islamic thugs. Someone,feed these gangsters,they look anemic. fwiw, they have always been alittle intimidating the way they behave on the road. For years, I have dealt with their hooliganism. The graph has risen quite steep in the last few years and they have been feeling more emboldened and justified in what they are doing. I'm not religious but I respect every religion and their right to practice it in our country but their has to be a decorum, standard for all, to follow. You can't uproot other's lives and day-to-day just because you decided to take up 1/2 of the road and \"allow\" the cars to pass. I have stood in traffic for anywhere between 1-4 hrs during kawar yatra or rath yatra every year and I can't begin to tell how it has affected my life, both professionally and personally They are gundas because they have danda. What about these peaceful peoples who walk with swords and stones? India becoming next Afghanistan soon run them over kyu bhai teri mummy ki mar kr chale gye the jo tuje inse dar lag raha h Perhaps you have never seen a moharram procession! Never seen a picture of people from a certain peaceful community praying on the roads and blocking traffic being called out here but ok! Idk, middle class has a lot to lose for them to even get involved with murder/politics. Not to offend you but you might wanna check if you study in a government school. Slightly better than allahu akbar gang That‚Äôs a lot of really small sticks to be acting so tough. ‚ÄúSpeak softly and carry a big stick‚Äù Tabhi to mujhe koi specific group se dikhta hai main ddur hi rehta hun kya pata kab phatt jaye Can someone give context? I am not from India. Who are these and what are they doing Technically so does terrorists Bahahahaha walking on the road with sticks and thinking they're hard ü§£ People waste their time with this crap and india will become bishwaguru ? Aw man are you afraidü•πü•πü•π! I am sure you know this but the statement that Religion is the opium of the masses was not used in the context you have used. >Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. Indeed, a similar case happened with me once I was traveling via Patna during some processions similar to this, had to take village roads due to nuisance. Idiocracy is at next level in this country irrespective of RELIGION. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When young people don‚Äôt have any prospects, they usually fall back on group affiliation to give them a an identity and a sense of purpose. While they are reprehensible, it‚Äôs is society that has failed them and allowed them to turn into this. It's st.domnic sovious sr sec high school and to not see something that is real doesn't make less real sorry for truth if it hurts When you have never seen real gang then this type of stupidity is expected! Ok let me try. I am also not a South Asian but have stayed in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka enough to understand local customs, religions, problems, politics etc. Still, forgive me if I miss small details here and there. These are religious processions called Kawad Yatra. This is a continuous tradition of states along the river Ganges since more than 2000 years, where sages would walk for 100s of kilometers as a dedication to lord Shiva, offering water from holy river to statue of Shiva in different temples across North India. In recent years after freedom from Islamic and British rules this tradition has regained popularity and not only sages but also common devotees have started following this tradition, in beliefs of getting blessings from Lord Shiva. Mostly, male members of those families who had a bad year or two of problematic economic, health situation or death in family, take a vow to dedicate lord Shiva for the whole month, arrange a leave from their jobs and walk barefoot, eat simple vegetarian plain food etc, while visiting all major temples in the path. The one holding sticks are volunteers organizing the crowd march. Stick is their defense against animals like dogs, idiotic drivers, attackers from the Islamists, and politically motivated goons which is quite common in this part of India. Those attacking this procession here on this reddit are mostly from the Islamic community and leftists who are against the current ruling party and some non Muslim kids who follow one sided secularism blindly. Use of danda 1. kill snake 2. elders use it to walk 3. kawariyas use it to take 2 water matka on it. But as you trash, your ideas are also trash Welcome to orange bhaarat ya the sexual exploitation of females in corporate world is done by so called educated isro head didnt went to ram temple, or abdul kalam did not talk about bhagvat geeta? Interesting, thank you for sharing your perspective. These are gundas and someone chant a.........h hu a,,,,,,r and blast himself is a school teachers son Bloody hyppocrates It was a general statement bud. Might be rich to not really care about consequences? bro these people are just carrying a danda which they use for carraying 2 matkas. How did you judge them by this image? Some days back also kawariyas broke someones car because that guy hit the matkas which they were carrying from more than 100 or 200kms that also barefoot, you assume people will not show anger as well. If education really make a person good human being then why are there happening sexual exploitation in corporates? Why some very educated ones in usa are phe\\*ophiles. yes sleep on street he will be on the way what they doing in this image? ofcourse religion is\\[RELIGION\\] Abe jaa be lodu Maybe ultra rich You are almost or clearly an atheist, and i appreciate that. If you are referring to Pakistan and Bangladesh, then it makes sense but using that as a representative of all Muslim-majority countries is inaccurate, as many nations in the GCC, such as the UAE, Bahrain, and Oman, have historically hosted large non-Muslim expatriate populations, sometimes exceeding their local populations, and managed religious diversity peacefully. Similarly, North African countries like Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, along with Far Eastern Muslim-majority nations such as Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia, have long histories of pluralism and coexistence with various religious communities. This broader perspective challenges the oversimplified notion that Muslim-majority countries inherently struggle with religious coexistence or violence. You guessed right. I think it‚Äôs a procession where devotees go to water bodies barefoot to fetch water to be offered to lord shiva on every monday of hindu lunar month of shravan no I mean they are not doing any weird thing which I can see in image. That danda is used to take the matka of water right, i think they are returning now. I am asking why this image was just takes and started fear mongering. Why does it matter if the ISRO head went to Ram temple? Or if Abdul Kalam spoke about Bhagvat Gita? Those are their personal beliefs and they aren't forcing anyone to believe in what they believe. I'm genuinely curious as to what your point even is over here. It's hilarious how very simple statements go through the heads of so many people. It's not that deep. Well I think Most of the time, Academically-declined (both education and behaviour wise) people‚Äôs desire towards power of authority attracts them to the religion. Their initial thoughts are to initiate authority towards religious people or people who want to avoid conflict. But their lack of sensibilities and education instigate the hooliganism, recklessness, terribly distasteful mindset. There‚Äôs not much going on in their life without this. While educated ones who genuinely believe and care about religion are with calm demeanour and respectful and responsible. Also, they mind their own business. They are seldom seen in these types of events. And, Yes This is quite true **regardless of the religion.** so people who gets settled in abroad should stop following their religion and should speak foreign language only .... nice I wonder if the same words would have been used for followers of Middle Eastern cults. Thank you for that, I was not trying to say that it was representative of all Muslim countries. I think I was more focused on the perspectives Honestly that‚Äôs true. We don‚Äôt have any evidence if they used the stick or not. OP could be exaggerating Its the SA, which was an organized brutes in the name of the NSDAP. They had become famous for beeing the strong arm of the nazis, harassing jews and fighting kommunists and other political enemys. They had been cut down in the end, forced to join other Nazi-organisations, because hitler felt endangered by the SA-leader Ernst R√∂hm. So those guys are beating up political enemys? Fair enough. Noble aims is a better phrase I guess. I can give several examples how cows were used as a tool by muslim invaders so that indian kings go backfoot. I mean if that was what caused *THIS* in their country‚Ä¶. It seems like a good idea‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.yeah‚Ä¶. The whole planet consumes beef. Why is this even relevant in the current context? You've been stating things that back nothing up to your claims. The whole thing was about science yet you somehow made it about cows. [https://www.vice.com/en/article/us-america-customs-cow-dung-cakes-india-covid/](https://www.vice.com/en/article/us-america-customs-cow-dung-cakes-india-covid/) bro OP is trying to spread hate nothing else. Similar case happened with me in a new city I visited, my friend I was going on a bike ride at 10PM, he said look there there are whores standing there you can get 1 in x amount. Bro I was like ye pahle se hi manke baitha hai, ese to koi jake normal ladki to problem create kar dega. >They cling to their religion and caste like they are life jackets. People who got there through refferals from their caste or family will hold its value high I made 2 comments, the main comment got deleted I guess, it was long one, now cant type that again. Anyways bro look at your previous comment who brought cows first Yes muslims are way better, right? They protect us ? And it doesn't matter if all the terrorists are muslims we still believe them. and do whole planets eats pork also? or dog and cats? lol keep seething, muslims do nothing wrong in this country in comparison to these goons for knowing what happened in indian subcontient you need to know history. I am just tired of seeing how some people are completely ignorant sad thing is such people justify their actions in the name of religions Hindus( in kavad Yatra) saved me from an accident. Again why the stereotype of labors only being kanwariyas, my argument was not actually regarding nourishment or strength to be precise, i just highlighted that all of them are not malnourished. Hope you got it Im from Poland, seen a lot of these guys marching on my trip to India, can someone explain who are they? Now when you write it, I get it. You didn't say this in prev comment, that you mean to highlight that all aren't malnourished. Also I'm not stereotyping, mostly labours are malnourished so used their example. Like a bag of oranges Well I was reacting to this guys blind and blanket judgement of all of them being malnourished. Ofcourse üôÇ NRIs view religion as a connection to their home. Uneducated people view it as political tool. Hey, guys. How to increase my comment karna? shame on you ‚ÄúSunday ho ya Monday, roz khao dande‚Äù Yeah the whole planet eats pork as well. I eat pork and beef as well. No, not everyone eats dogs and cats. This isn't the gotcha moment you think it is. You thought only Muslims eat beef right? üòÇ Literally every community in India has sufficient beef consumers. If you don't like it don't eat it. Don't go around justifying killing people in the name of beef. BJP has never done anything to provide special protection for Hindus? Pretty sure hitting cars and bikes with sticks is damage to personal property The premise of my comment was to show religious indoctrination has caused a lot of issues with critical thinking. There are plenty of things apart from beef I can pick up as well. Tell me why it's relevant in the current context. I'll tell you why you're bringing it up. You're basically insinuating all Muslims are bad because Muslim invaders came to India in the past. Man it's so easy to see through your argument. Don't hide behind fancy words. You're trying to justify why you don't like Muslims. Just say it as it is instead of beating around the bush üòÇ Exactly happened with me, I live in ayodhya and was going to Lko for some work and some of these hooligans were showing there dandas to the passing-by cars. Except white shirt, he might be the gunda boss, looks too well fed The chairman Mao philosophy! Keep 'em starving so that they remain stupid. Modi‚Äôs India. Where all mighty gods supposedly need to be protected by low IQ unemployed scum. I don't even understand why should one be proud of their religion or language etc. We were born into it as a default setting. It like saying I'm proud I have two eyes. yes too bad,safron gundas. ha hasan ho hasan Muharram gang is love. Why do they join? This is a religious gathering/ March known as \"Kanwar Yatra\". The Kanwar Yatra is an annual Hindu pilgrimage in India, where millions of devotees, known as \"Kanwariyas\", walk to fetch sacred water from the river Ganga. The water is then offered at Shiva temples, especially during the holy month of \"Shravan\" (July-August). This practice is to worship/honor Lord Shiva, and the pilgrims carry the water in Kanwars/decorated poles with pots. The journey involves walking hundreds of kilometers, with some pilgrims even covering distances barefoot. Local governments often provide facilities, including security and medical aid. These kids are really brainwashed by cult religious goons. Everything in the name of God blah The world would be a better place with these people removed..... Necessity is the mother of invention. If these individuals hadn‚Äôt been suppressed for decades due to THE appeasement, they would have naturally remained the cheerful and vibrant group they were meant to be. Lolz weak crowd of sheeps Hello Good My uttar pradesh is a sad sad sad story; hopeless the eastward one goes, me living at the precipe of where the sh\\*\\*t start to hit the fan; can only imagine what happens in such areas; there is extreme poverty with functional anarchy you have to be utterly vigilant just to survive. Is everyone from the yatra hitting people with sticks, there are some bad apples everywhere There is no prospect brother for them; both the major religions and major castes just wait for their turn at government to become the so called Bahubali that;s the best they can hope for in their life in youth and family and familial politics in middle and old age I feel you bro. Same feels as Muharram. Bro issue is (or rather the tradegy is) due to poor economic status their lives would amount to nothing anyway Tere kaun se makkan chura lia, jo tere ko itni jal rahi hai. Issue is (or rather the tradegy is) due to poor economic status their lives would amount to nothing anyway; this is just the anger venting route. Life sucks hard in UP and those with resources have to be utterly vigilant. Typical communist logic my friend üòÅ Are you a funded person from congress or George shuru !!!??? Because you don‚Äôt find madarsa chap are teaching radical Islam (which is actually real) and spreading violence, rap, blasphemy chamche Yes sir here is victim card use it eveytime sir . I can see mass cult mob during muhorm time and ramzan time also when they ocupy roads and do prayers they block roads use high sound mix's daily such a sound pollution Wrong people dude they usually spread peace all time üåöüåöüí£ One terrorist spread so much peace she was elected to the lok sabha üí£üî•‚ò†Ô∏è That's not possible. They won't be walking on the streets. I've never seen one. Ever. Gaadi kabhi bhi tod skte hai yeh log üòÇ can someone tell what's the context of this image? That's radicalization in a nutshell and the government turns a blind eye How can u judge the whole crowd because someone has a danda in his hand . Also such crowds pass through our locality. During sawan and none of them harm anyone. Also during muslim festive Muharram theee is muslim julus and they dont even harm anyone. I can see guys like u are real problem for society. I run away from these people You mean fascists From protection I mean, security during festivals specially in areas where often 2 community fights. This looks like rebuttle for other community that involves in fights of an individual from the same community. If you ever observed that happening. üíÄ >No scientific temperament in this country Just my opinion but I don't think them knowing all the laws of Thermodynamics would change much! God forbid someone follows a different religion üíÄ Back in my day, bait used to be believable. And ppl will still call out Muslims who just want to go to the mosque every Friday just to pray. Kavariyas as gangsters.... Such a lame point, that's too for satisfying ego. Photographs itself says people are walking on sides and letting other pass, if sticks are we concerned then in India it's common to have sticks by guides when there is crowd....it is not for fight or to defend, it's just... Hopefully we need to know much than to just wake up from bed and start assuming üòâ What about Muharram then U need to be proud to become a foot soldier. Fight for your masters and stay poor for generations to come. Best strategy is to not be blind supporter. It's your job to criticize your government because the mass media has their hands tied. You are starving, it's ok. House has no electricity, no issue just use wood. No good schools, no problem just join whatsapp university. All these problems exist because people from other religions are responsible for it. Don't forget to vote for me next election ok. Tred Carefully ! Illiterate POS people That's what happens due to unemployment + hidden unemployment and low quality education plus. It's as they say \"an empty head is a devil's workshop\". I hope Indian education system undergoes some much needed reforms. Islamic thugs, Hindu thugs they‚Äôre all the same. now reverse the religion and dare speak on them Ok, This is really stupid, but I read \"gangster\" as \"gamer\" and seeing the picture I immediately thought of GTA 1. God, I hope I'm the only one. I see a guy on religious march holding a stock(probably in self defence or guiding traffic) that is not going to hurt a dog but see people here branding him hooligan, terrorist and what not. People here are acting like they own the country and guy like him should not have a right to live. Which type of Muslim? It's either this or we'll be the next Bangladesh. People have voted for this in the last 3 elections. What is gangster about this? They are on their yatra. Funny thing is y'all will justify every other road blocking and think this is wrong. You should be proud of your eyes buddy. So should you about yr religion and language. It's your identity. Hating it is hating ur own existence and showing weakness for tribal evil to prey upon. Just talk about North India, i belong to OBC but my clan is Kshatriya. In Kerala caste doesn‚Äôt make any sense because caste is literally inexistent in Kerala Isi tarha k group se PM bna hai India ka. Or support kro inki. Idk man looks tamer than the farmer protests ü§£ Why should that be his identity ? Create your own identity and then be proud of it. They are carrying only wooden stick which is required in inght time for safety against strret dogs That's a good example of selective amnesia. You didn't read about those guys hitting cars, did you? What rituals and yatra needs violence? Does God gives you better \"punya\"? they beat you ? they attacked your Car ? if no then how you declaring them Gunda ? they have wood sticks for self defence because they get attacked sometimes by peiceful communities ! go search on google ! For Gods Sake we are happy with these Gangster. Atleast they won‚Äôt kill Hindus. Afraid of Muzlims who convert, behead, bomb and rape What‚Äôs the threat here? I‚Äôm sorry I either see them with a stick or looking in the opposite direction. Where‚Äôs the threat or gangster-ness here. I‚Äôm genuinely curious True I see them as terrorist, the definition of terrorism is using unlawful violence and intimidation against civilians.. people think its only bombing..these people are also terrorist..I will not use any less word than this religious fanatics ruining shit for everyone since religion bro ye boht dur se ate jate they use these sticks for supports even i have done this w them har cheez galt nhi sochna chaiye People like these actually don't know much about their religion. They are mostly busy in showing off that they are the greatest devotee, instead of actually working on improving their character as well as their deeds. They don't have rationality in them. They are just protecting sacred water from basterds a religious procession where people from all castes come together and go on pilgrimage they eat together, sleep together and walk together > gets termed as gangster by brainded person for going on a pilgrimage wow btw other then a few incidents here and there I don't think kawads have ever caused any problem they do these processions every year but I think ik why you are so scared lmao fyi most of the kawads are from bahujan samaj are you trying to be a casteist op lmao I bet you think the PFI as peaceful people and rss as a terrorist org lmao I am a very very religious guy and even a RW still I hate these people... Like bro get a fucking job! Clowns more like it. Our leaders (specially our PM) are responsible for this. Instead of focusing on Education, they are openly spreading hatred and youth is following. You can love and still be not-proud of something. Parents love their kids and at the same time not be proud of them. The root cause of problems in any religion is extremism. Abb obc boldiya toh abb koi ayega aur bolega jatiwad ü§° lekin inko reality samjh nhi ayega kair choro mai toh desh chordunga ( brahmin hokr befaltu ka hate le chuka hu bhout ) jaalte hai sale UP always suck This is an example of jobless people. They will say they are religious but when they see a woman they will harass her without any fear. Bro never saw tajia holders or bakra cutters with skull cap ... they are Terro.. ahm ahm ... ü§ßü§°ü§£ More like a syndicate. The stone pelters won't realise that. They will live in filth and call it a lifestyle. Hahahahahhaha You‚Äôd be surprised how much caste is still a factor abroad. I‚Äôve seen it myself. It‚Äôs pretty evident. Follow your religion, but skip parts of it that aren‚Äôt really modern world worthy. Adapt, for the best. Caste is an inherently crappy concept, and so is arranged marriage. And still fing common anywhere we Indians are in the world. Ab urban naxals bhi gyaan denge...? even a love marriage is an arrange marriage itself ... the thing in India that dowry involves in this pratice and even i saw in love marriages ... dowry is taking place This seems like a religious procession. Usually it happens at end of Sravan (sawan ka mahina) month end. This is where devotees visit Shiv ling to put water by foot. It's too intimidating, you have to follow their orders to go safely. It took me 2 hours to cover 1 hour drive last August. And original kavar who do it for their religious believe has small 1-2 (kg load. These idiots carry 25 kg in group to boast hey I carried this much. They have added so much toxicity to the religion Really or just to insult you're saying it. Then where is the pic of that act. They could just be shouting to make everyone hear that go that side or let us pass. Logic rip. Interestingly you're saying it, then there's religious angle, other side road blocks pics will start coming, which are true as well Dowry is a different matter altogether. Have you ever seen a real gangster? Imagine a Muslim family driving through this. Thats not very gangster. More like chichorey tapori Yes, have you not seen the videos of them assaulting police officers and destroying cars? It's not just a few bad apples, it's the whole orchard. The reason these goons operate like this is because of the protection that the police and government give to them. Try to find any other religious group that does this without heavy police around them. bhai sambhal kar rahiyo koi bharosa nahi inka mob lynching hojayega. RIP Aryan Mishra Gangsters or terrorists? Easy run over Now you know why savarnas oppose feeding eggs and meat to poor kids. Iss desh ke log education employment par kyu nhi bolte ? The root cause of all this is corruption. Have you ever cheated in your school exam or not completed your work? If yes, then you don't have the right to ask for good roads and traffic management. If no, then you can find more people who have never done a bad thing in their lives and form a govt. And then fix all this that you don't like. And you people find muslims with swords very safe üòÇüòÇüòÇ Unfortunately I do not believe in god that much otherwise if God really existed with the whole heaven and hell concept, these fools would be the first to be thrown in hell and suffer for the rest of their life. If god really existed as how they depict god to be, then God probably hates them with all that god has. They literally go against anything hinduism preaches. As a Hindu I agree with this Majorly broken or semi broken homes.... Abusive or drunk father's. Funny thing is they get donations and support from educated people as well to fuel their hatred. But none of these sponsors never send their child to run a march and yell at others. And their excuse, ‚ÄúSaving God, Saving Hindus, Saving India‚Äù. Are they really saving anything? Still better than sitting on the road with the asses up and blocking it. Try touching them and see what they do, guys here are just carrying a stick! Well.. y‚Äôall empowered these behaviours in this particular for past 8 years. You might as well experience some of it. The kind that follows teachings and not a random baba. Islam tells us to follow the law of the land. Having processions and disturbing the peace of others isn‚Äôt an Islamic practice or an ideal. They mean scientific curiosity and a habit of questioning things and critical thinking Lack of education make you goons I meant Shia or Sunni Lets see their love for the land and Hinduism, send them to the borders haha Few questions‚Ä¶. 1. Why are they holding Danda?? 2. Does it have any religious/ritualistic significance? 3. Are they using it to protect themselves? 4. Are they using it to intimidate others? If someone gets intimidated unnecessarily, whose problem is it anyway? Atleast they aren't Muslims *Terrorists By the way, where are they going? and what will they achieve after this? Will they get gold coins after all this? For these stupid pepole and trying to be cool they will not even think twice before doing something wrong . I wish they understood how adorably stupid this looks to the rest of the world. Ladies and gentlemen, the anpadh kuposhit gawars of the world, right in front of you. Istg we need more jobs in the country This Looks like a kaavar yatra, not sure if the person posted is high or always has hate for hindus. when people come up on streets in muharram with knives and shelves and show blood shed all around, then these people are busy sucking their partners pu**y/d*ck. God help you. UP is doomed Modi was one of these guys when he was younger. Do some research idiot. Kanhaiya Lal is killed by .... I live in chattisgarh, here I have seen what happens during, muslim festival kids have knives with them, hindu festivals stine pelted, only happen during idol is taken to rivers, later people news and gov claim it's due to DJ or lour noise bro why ? The government is BJP here mostly police give them protection too. It's a cycle you can't blame one side. This needs to be stopped but the question is how no one trusts each other here. Same thing happened to me when I was going through car and this kawad yatra was going on they behaves like gundas they are not letting my vehicle to go and over take showing lathis and danda while traveling on bikes and showing that they are bigger than u U have follow the order of these bahubali when they are on road driving rashly and becoming threat to other people's And one more thing is that if ur car touches to them they will become violant beats u on road and total damges ur car What the fuck is this happening in our society Danda pakadne se koi gangsters nhi ban jata ü§°ü§°ü§°... True. Hindu extremists won't exist if Muslim extremists didn't exist. Lol fair enough You don't have to be an atheist to not force religion on others. Agreed. Tbf scientific temperament didn't exist even when Congress was in power. It wasn't there back then but with the BJP we're going further backwards. Idk man. I don't think BJP is any worse than Congress. That's your personal opinion but from what I see the only party getting triggered over superficial things like non vegetarian food, place of worship, superstition and a bunch of other backward practices mostly come from the BJP. But sure believe what you want to believe. Minorities do all of the above and they vote for Congress. Yeah but majority is majority Ideally yes but Congress loves to appease Minorities. That doesn't change the fact that the BJP influences the majority of the countrymen. Exactly üíØüíØ You\"ve Mean Islam by That Too much of hate which isn't needed at all. I agree this creates a problem in traffic and frustrated us. But don't just criminalise what you see in the first instance. That stick is to keep their mates in a limit and in a line such that they do not cross over to the middle of the road, their intention isn't to intimidate someone, but yeah that is a mob and things do escalate but stop looking at them in this way. Government couldn't mobilise this zeal and passion and they are unemployed hence doing what they find reassuring and satisfactory (religious hardships). They aren't brandishing weapons like swords. They are aware about what they are causing hence looking at the passing by cars and they keep check on themselves by holding a stick in their hands they never intend to create law and order problem(I'm talking about majority of people in there) Political supported goons I remember watching them when I was kid from my school bus thinking this is cool, you go on a trek around the country, get to have food and no work. Later I realised this is a cycle of poverty clinging onto religion. I remember watching them when I was kid from my school bus thinking this is cool, you go on a trek around the country, get to have food and no work. Later I realised this is a cycle of poverty clinging onto religion. Gangster. Don‚Äôt degrade the word gangster. They are pests. Been living in Abroad since 2018 and i saw no one protecting churches. Hater is a converted ramdika True but things wouldn't get better if Congress had that kind of influence either. Luckily they don't and neither are their followers as stupid Congress members and minorities are diehard Gandhi family fans and they're pretty stupid (not all minorities obviously). Nope. Minorities just want to live without getting lynched by the sangh. The sane ones, yes. There are minorities who want to lynch Hindus though (Supporters of Muslim parties, Christian terrorists, etc.) There are sane BJP supporters as well (like me). Christian terrorists? Lol you've been brainwashed by the sangh You might be the sane one but the PM is Modi and he orchestrated the Gujarat 2002 riots. Is BBC a Sanghi source? Agreed, the problem only exists in the North East but to claim that Christian terrorism doesn't exist in India is objectively false. The PM did orchestrate the riots but in his defence, there haven't been any riots since. There have been lesser riots under BJP rule than under Congress rule. > Is BBC a Sanghi source? Well I'll give it to that this is legitimate but no where close to what the sangh has done in India. > The PM did orchestrate the riots but in his defence, there haven't been any riots since. So if a rapist says he raped once but never again that's alright? I'm surprised at the fact that you admitted that he actually did orchestra the 2002 riots but still went ahead with voting for him and still call yourself a sane BJP supporter. It's sane to back up enablers of riots, rapes and murders? > There have been lesser riots under BJP rule than under Congress rule. This is objectively false. There have been far more riots and religious attacks after the sangh came to power. Something as little as eating beef can get you killed now. I feel the same scared when people are out on streets with swordsü§° Ever heard of ‚ÄòEdappal Ottam‚Äô? üòÇ If a rapist raped once and all rapes on Earth stopped ever since, I do feel sorry for his victim but things are objectively better in the bigger scale of things. All political parties enable riots, rapes, and murders. I'm going to need a source for more riots since BJP came to power. Yes, the vigilantism is getting out of hand but I blame the courts not BJP. People have gotten impatient with how slow courts are. It takes 20 years to get justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. > If a rapist raped once and all rapes on Earth stopped ever since, I do feel sorry for his victim but things are objectively better in the bigger scale of things. That is on very fucked up take. Justice wasn't served and you're relying on the fact that the perpetrator will not do it again. Also sets the wrong precedent. What if a person sees this commits rape and says he won't do it again? It's beyond me how you can even think they can't be held accountable and this is pretty much why the country never progresses. > All political parties enable riots, rapes, and murders. The preparators are usually reprimanded in other parties but with the BJP they're given a hero's welcome and get their feet touched. With the Bilkis Bano case a significant portion of the sangh praised the rapists. No this is disproportionate in the BJP. After seeing Kathua, Unnao, Hathras, Bilkis Bano, Brij Bhushan and a lot of other cases I can safely tell BJP not only turns a blind eye but also facilitates rape. > I'm going to need a source for more riots since BJP came to power. You can also do a simple wikipedia search and see by the year how many riots were there. > Yes, the vigilantism is getting out of hand but I blame the courts not BJP. How do you blame the government for stuff cow vigilantes? The issue people can't tolerate different ideologies and culture and resort to violence to prove their point. > People have gotten impatient with how slow courts are. It takes 20 years to get justice. Justice delayed is justice denied. Ironic you say this since in the previous paragraph you literally said if a rapist commits rape only once and never you're fine with the person being let go and with situations like Modi orchestrating riots you're even fine with him being the PM. TLP, Indian version Looks like an orange squad protest They Travel in from many forests and night, That's why they carry a Danda for scaring those animals."
