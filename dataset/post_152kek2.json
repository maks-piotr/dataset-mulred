        "Waiting for Riot MMO for the next 8 years. Just waiting...",
        "Waiting for riot mmo, and not play anything until then, however long it takes. Becoming healthy and stockpiling food so i can die on the chair playing it, the greatest game of all time",
        "Still playing ToTK. I got stuck in making increasingly stupid & impractical builds & didn’t realize how many days passed by. On that one, finding shrines is easier if you traverse through the nether world & mark them all ‘cause maps are mirrors.\n\nAlso playing Magic Reawakened but it’s my first card game and I’m so frustrated. If any of y’all playing please join our club. It’s number 2 in India and we need good players.",
        "Playing Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin. Has a different vibe to Dark Souls 1 but I am liking it a lot. Currently exploring Huntsman's Copse."
