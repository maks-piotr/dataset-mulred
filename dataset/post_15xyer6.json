        "What is 498 ipc?",
        "Law that prescribes imprisonment for any dowry complaint by a woman, regardless of legitimacy of such complaint.",
        "To claim that no woman misuses the provisions is nonsense. The issue , like many of the issues in our country, is that we rush to legislate and don't bother about the implementation or implications. Shoddy police work, no problem, let's invoke UAPA or PSA . A well entrenched man walked free from a case, let's make a non bailable law. The fact is that we don't really care about the issues,not really, all we want to do is to show that we have acted.",
        "Was it? In my personal experience they apply the punishment but see if it's being charged or not.",
        "Pending investigation. They can be freed after that.",
        "That is true for everything, so doesn't really have to be said.",
        "Make nonsense laws which can be easily misused\n\nSee them getting misused\n\nüòÆ",
        "Finally coming out of the slumber, are we?",
        "The bigger problem is we have a corruptible police force who can arrest you for random reasons. And law abiding people would rather pay bribes or fines rather than dealing with our opaque and slow legal system.",
        "Problem is I have seen some cases where honest man had to suffer because his wife eloped with her BF and has the wife had good family background, they were able to hire good lawyers and lobby and stuff to make the husband pay for it..",
        "Investigation are forever pending in India. You know that.",
        "You know that 95% of marriages have abuse and yet the idiotic men want to be the victims",
        "I literally didn't say anything either way.",
        "So the cases where Men are victim are supposed to be just accepted as such? \n\nPeople like you are impossible to understand. Gaand mein se nikaal ke dimaag sir mein lagao thoda.",
        "Did marriage rate fall or something? Since when did the courts started caring about men",
        "We are not talking about the men in your family. Calm down.",
        "Actually I think they came up with these laws believing that people will responsibly use these. But the group of women who should have benefited from it are not able to take advantage and the ones who can, go all out. I know 5 men personally whose lives are ruined because of this. 2 chose to settle with monetary payments, 1 saved by the judge because of some last minute evidence in his favor, 2 are fighting on and refuse to bend. 1 has written a book called bitter half and the other has started a non profit to advise other men like him. The latter is a childhood friend and breaks my heart to see him in so much trouble. Lost his father recently because the girls family just wouldnt stop harrassments and kept sending goons at their place.",
        "We‚Äôre talking about Indian men in general. The vast majority of the creeps and assholes",
        "And why do you think the males in your family are the minority? Everyone is a creep except your father or brother?",
        "That‚Äôs not what I said",
        "You edited the reply. And no, men in my family are the role models of my life. Especially my Father, so yeah I would always speak against generalizing.",
        "Generalization will not help.\nSaying men can't be victims of this crime because many do commit such acts\nIs like saying you are a scammer because many have been found to be scammers.\n\nDoesn't help at all.",
        ">People like you are impossible to understand. Gaand mein se nikaal ke dimaag sir mein lagao thoda.\n\nBro woke up and chose violence.",
        "Hate to go for the Low hanging fruit but you're a frequent poster in r/autism \nI don't feel any further discourse with you would lead to anything productive.",

        "How about we jail the women with the same punishment after they are freed ? Seems fair right ?",
        "Whats the full story?  (i don‚Äôt wanna sign up)",
        "So laws protecting women from harassment is nonsense?",

        "No. But giving unchecked legal power is",

        "498a is non-bailable offence. It should be made bailable",
        "Lol. On what grounds?",
        "If he is falsely accused then how will he prove his innocence ? Bail gives temporary release and this will give him a chance to prove that he is not guilty",
        "Misuse of any legal provision, including Section 498A, is a concern. It's important to ensure that legal processes are followed correctly and that accusations are based on genuine grievances. Misuse can harm innocent individuals and undermine the credibility of the legal system.\n\nhttps://falserapedatabase.substack.com/",
        "Did you even look at the link I shared? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThe court ask for evidence of abuse upon which they investigate. They will only arrest if the court agree the accusations are true after the investigation. The accused can also defend their part with a lawyer if they believe they are falsely accused. \n\nSeriously you think police would just arrest people like that?",
        "Let me try to explain this in short.\n\n498A was introduced to end dowry deaths I. E. women forced to commit suicide or tortured to near death. \n\nIn such cases, police is expected to act proactively and with minimal input, as they essentially lead to a breakdown of society. Thus there is no qualification or requirement of abuse that needs to be met to file FIR by the plaintiff, as it is assumed police is doing so to to prevent such abuse. However, to convict the defendant, there are criterias to be met, as mentioned in the wording of the section. \n\nNow, when it comes to Court and the innocent has been in jail for a few weeks/months and the matter finally come to hearing to the Judicial Magistrate/Sessions Judge, they realize that there exists no proof of such crime in the first place, and the innocent is released.\n\nWhich is why you end up with Courts frustrated with bad laws. By the time Court can step in to help and quash/discharge the case, months/years may have passed. Often, it is too late and many innocents are forced to commit suicide. \n\nhttps://www.barandbench.com/news/women-unleashed-legal-terrorism-misusing-section-498a-ipc-calcutta-high-court\n\nhttps://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/genuine-cases-sexual-offences-exception-law-heavily-biased-men-allahabad-high-court\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-high-court-expresses-worry-over-alarming-increase-of-false-rape-cases/article36042093.ece\n\nAlso, I don't understand what procedure you mean. Which section of CrPC are you talking about? If you care to read your own link, question 17 clearly states the police can arrest people indiscriminately and without a warrant from Court upon inkling of 498A. All that's needed is a complaint from the woman (Question 14, point ii).",
        "\n‚ÄúTrial / Court Procedure under Section 498A\n\nAs has been stated before, the trial or a criminal court procedure is initiated with the instance of an FIR or a police complaint. The detailed trial procedure has been given below:\nFIR (First Information Report) / Police complaint: the first step is a Police Complaint or a First Information Report. This is covered under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. An FIR puts the entire case into motion.\nInvestigation and Report by Officer: The second step after the FIR, is investigation by the Investigation Officer. After the examination of the facts and circumstances, collection of evidence, and examination of persons and other necessary steps, the officer completes the investigation and prepares the investigation.‚Äù\n\nRead this and tell me what do you mean by ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no requirement of evidence‚Äù",
        "‚ÄúInnocent has to be in jail‚Äù? dude, the court won‚Äôt arrest the accused unless the investigation proves he‚Äôs not innocent. You‚Äôre making this up.",
        "You do realize, and I'm repeating myself here, that in 498A, the police can arrest immediately and without warrant. And that secondly, to get this started 154 CrPC is the first and only step (mere oral complaint by complainant).",
        "Give me the proof of it.",
        "Either you‚Äôre misunderstanding or you‚Äôre denying the facts because you‚Äôre afraid of people facing consequences of their actions",
        "The police will arrest the accused without warrant IF the investigation proves he‚Äôs guilty",
        "I can smell a controversy building ups",
        "Once again, 498A of IPC is a NBCO (Non Bailable and Cognizable Offence). A Cognizable Offence is one which means the police will arrest anyone without a warrant or needing Court's permission/assessment.\n\nIt's clear you have no understanding of the legal system and are simply basing your arguments on Google. I will refrain from commenting further. Wish you the best.",
        " \n\n## Trial / Court Procedure under Section 498A\n\nAs has been stated before, the trial or a criminal court procedure is initiated with the instance of an FIR or a police complaint. The detailed trial procedure has been given below:\n\n1. **FIR (First Information Report) / Police complaint:** the first step is a Police Complaint or a First Information Report. This is covered under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. An FIR puts the entire case into motion.\n2. **Investigation and Report by Officer:** The second step after the FIR, is investigation by the Investigation Officer. After the examination of the facts and circumstances, collection of evidence, and examination of persons and other necessary steps, the officer completes the investigation and prepares the investigation.\n3. **Charge-sheet before Magistrate:** The police then files the charge sheet before the magistrate. The charge-sheet consists of all the criminal charges against the accused.\n4. **Arguments before Court and Framing of Charges:** On the fixed date of hearing, the Magistrate hears the parties‚Äô arguments on the charges that have been set and then finally frames the charges.\n5. **Plea of guilty:** Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 talks about the plea of guilty, after framing of the charges the accused is given an opportunity to plead guilty, and the responsibility lies with the judge to ensure that the plea of guilt was voluntarily made. The judge may upon its discretion convict the accused.\n6. **Evidence by Prosecution:** After the framing of the charges and the accused pleading ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô, the evidence is first given by the Prosecution, upon whom the burden of proof initially (generally) lies. Both oral and documentary evidence can be produced. The magistrate has the power to issue summons to any person as a witness or order him to produce any document.\n7. **Cross Examination of Witnesses by Accused/Counsel:** Witnesses of the prosecution when produced before the court are cross examined by the accused or his/her counsel.\n8. **Evidence by Accused if any, in defence:** If the accused has any evidence, it is presented to the Courts at this stage. He/she is given this opportunity to make his/her case stronger. However, since the burden of proof is on the prosecution i.e. the alleged victim, the accused is not required to present evidence.\n9. **Cross Examination of Witness by Prosecution:** If witnesses are produced by the defence, they will be cross-examined by the Prosecution.\n10. **Conclusion of Evidence:** Once the court has been presented with evidence from both sides, the evidence is concluded by the Court/Judge.\n11. **Oral / Final Arguments:** The final stage, nearing the judgement is the stage of final arguments. Here, both parties take turns (first, the prosecution and then the defence) and make final oral arguments in front of the judge.\n12. **Judgement by the Court:** Based upon the facts and circumstances of that case, and upon the arguments made and evidence produced, the Court gives its final judgement. The Court gives its reasons in support of the acquittal or conviction of the accused and pronounces its final order.\n13. **Acquittal or Conviction:** If the accused is held guilty, he/she is convicted and if held ‚Äònot-guilty‚Äô, the accused is acquitted in the final judgement.\n14. **If Convicted, Hearing on Quantum of Sentence:** If the accused is held guilty and convicted, a hearing will take place to decide the quantum or extent of the Sentence or jail time.\n15. **Appeal to Higher Courts:** An appeal to Higher Courts can be made if the scenario allows it. From Sessions court, an appeal can be made to the High Court and from High Court, to the Supreme Court.\n\n \n\n## When Can A Person Be Held Guilty Under Section 498A, IPC?\n\nFor a person to be held guilty under Section 498A, IPC it is important for the prosecution to compulsorily prove the following:\n\n1. That the woman is married. This Section protects women from unruly and cruel behaviour that gets meted out to her in her marital home.\n2. That the woman is subject to cruelty or harassment. Cruelty as discussed above can take on myriad forms.\n3. That such cruelty or harassment is suffered by her at the hands of her husband or her in-laws or both.\n\n \n\n## Is An Arrest Under Section 498a, Ipc, Automatic?\n\nThere came a time when arrests under Section 498A, IPC became unnecessarily rampant and routinely automatic. They were effected with the menacing motives of disgruntled wives rather than as effective tools to aid police investigation.\n\nThis malpractice was eventually checked by the Supreme Court of India, with the passage of judgements like Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014) and Rajesh Sharma v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2017), wherein the Hon‚Äôble Court while clearly recognising the gross misuse of Section 498A, IPC, issued guidelines to the Police while making arrests under the same.\n\nAccordingly, while investigating a 498A case, the Police instead of carrying out an automatic arrest of the accused are mandated to issue a notice to him under Section 41A, CrPC to join the ongoing investigation into the offence. Arrests are not mandated to be carried out under Section 498A, IPC if the accused continues to join such investigation, as and when called to do so. Hence, it was thus that unnecessary arrests by the Police were curbed by the Court.\n\nHowever, once the FIR is registered, it is better recommended to take anticipatory bail. When the accused moves the court for anticipatory bail, certain conditions may be imposed by the court upon him/her. Depositing a demand draft of a certain amount in the name of the wife or other dependents as a part of maintenance etc. could be one of the conditions. But, when there exists a specific provision for maintenance of wife and child, such conditional anticipatory bail granted under section 498A would go against the law.",
        "You may have missed the comment I pasted. The arrest are made when the accused to do not comply with the investigation.",
        "where does it day you need proof though?\n\nisnt every law supposed to be standing on its own? that , in my very very very humble opinion, means that the statement of the law has to be a self supporting sentence. \n\nCan you please explain this to me?",
        "No. The law doesn‚Äôt stand on its own. If it does, anyone could be charged without trial or investigation for any law. You didn‚Äôt answer my question though. Where does it say it you don‚Äôt need proof. \n\nhttps://lawrato.com/indian-kanoon/ipc/section-498a\n\nGo to the procedure of the complaint. Read it and weep.",
        "> kept sending goons at their place.\n\nYeah, I'd definitely get a door peephole, extra iron grill with a lock outside the main door, and atleast 1 gun to deal with goons.",
        "I always love watching a meltdown",
        "You're oozing with so much hate and carrying a lot of negativity on your chest, which must be burdensome. Here's to hoping you live a life free of victimhood and falsehoods, as most men are decent individuals.",
        "Wtf",
        "Yo dude thanks for this link! You‚Äôre totally fuckin‚Äô right - the complaint and FIR are registered, investigated and then brought in front of a magistrate who brings it to trial if evidence is provided.\n\nThere‚Äôs this idea that the police will just pick up the husband or in-laws and put them in jail. Happened to my own neighbors, but my parents keep assuming they were never at fault.\n\nThe fact that you have 22 downvotes shows you how pervasive this misogyny is.",
        "I know I am right. Look at how they stopped talking when I throw the facts at their faces. How the morons were whining about how the law is ‚Äúmisused‚Äù without researching is ridiculous. They don‚Äôt care about truth or justice. They hate that they can‚Äôt control women and they can‚Äôt get away from law if they force control over them.",
        "The casual rate at which spousal abuse is taken in India is fucking terrible.",
        "This mental_flight person needs to calm downüòÇ",
        "If a woman walks into the police station and say that her husband and in laws are mistreating her for dowry , police can put them behind bars immediately.",
        "Dude, Please don‚Äôt lie. Police didn‚Äôt do shit when my mother pleaded for their protection against my father‚Äôs abuse.",
        "Generally you will have to make a good case. A girl first went to her mom's place and broke some stuff asked her mom to slap her and went to PS and filed 498a. The boy was arrested immediately. SC advisory is not mandatory so it's the discretion of the officer.  \nThe arrest are made when physical violence is involved and fake complaints are lost in court but earlier there was lot of social stigma attached to it. People started ignoring the families against whom the complaint was filed. Things have changed now. But the misuse continues due to lack of policy",

        "The last article said the some cases have been dismissed upon finding lack of evidences. So what?",
        "I can share the case number if you want. Evidence was there since she beat herself up. Accused can always defend themselves but in this section police resort to immediate arrest because people will pay bribes to stop their family to go to jail.  \nSimilarly for rape. The mere statement of women that consent was absent is enough. These have been changed by SC and in future all PS will learn proper course of action to protect both parties. Until then we will have collateral damage.  \nAt this point I don't know what are you defending?? It is well settled that women misuse this law and SC has taken action, action from parliament is missing.  \nYou are very butt hurt by your father's episode and I understand that it may be so because these are individual episodes and so was your's.  \nPolice in India cannot be trusted, they have  lot's of tricks to harass and take bribes even though they know that the case will not stand in court.

        "Then we have to agree to disagree because I am failing to understand your point.",
        "Dude, you said there were evidences of her beating up. Now you are telling me there‚Äôs none? Lol. I knew you were lying.",

This has to be rectified not by removing the law but by amending it so that the accused is not put behind bars automatically.  \nAlso I am not in favor of action against complainant because I know how tough it is to prove in court.",
        "It's not argument about whether a guilty person should be in prison or not, that's obvious, but on the non-guilty person being put behind bars. You have made big generalisations and written long paragraphs already to win some online argument, you aren't worth wasting any time on.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Women have unleashed \"legal terrorism\" by misusing Section 498A IPC: Calcutta High Court",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "*shocked Pikachu face*",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "&#x200B; I am shocked! Shocked I say!! What is 498 ipc? Law that prescribes imprisonment for any dowry complaint by a woman, regardless of legitimacy of such complaint. To claim that no woman misuses the provisions is nonsense. The issue , like many of the issues in our country, is that we rush to legislate and don't bother about the implementation or implications. Shoddy police work, no problem, let's invoke UAPA or PSA . A well entrenched man walked free from a case, let's make a non bailable law. The fact is that we don't really care about the issues,not really, all we want to do is to show that we have acted. Was it? In my personal experience they apply the punishment but see if it's being charged or not. Pending investigation. They can be freed after that. That is true for everything, so doesn't really have to be said. Make nonsense laws which can be easily misused See them getting misused üòÆ Finally coming out of the slumber, are we? The bigger problem is we have a corruptible police force who can arrest you for random reasons. And law abiding people would rather pay bribes or fines rather than dealing with our opaque and slow legal system. Problem is I have seen some cases where honest man had to suffer because his wife eloped with her BF and has the wife had good family background, they were able to hire good lawyers and lobby and stuff to make the husband pay for it.. Investigation are forever pending in India. You know that. You know that 95% of marriages have abuse and yet the idiotic men want to be the victims I literally didn't say anything either way. So the cases where Men are victim are supposed to be just accepted as such? People like you are impossible to understand. Gaand mein se nikaal ke dimaag sir mein lagao thoda. Did marriage rate fall or something? Since when did the courts started caring about men We are not talking about the men in your family. Calm down. Actually I think they came up with these laws believing that people will responsibly use these. But the group of women who should have benefited from it are not able to take advantage and the ones who can, go all out. I know 5 men personally whose lives are ruined because of this. 2 chose to settle with monetary payments, 1 saved by the judge because of some last minute evidence in his favor, 2 are fighting on and refuse to bend. 1 has written a book called bitter half and the other has started a non profit to advise other men like him. The latter is a childhood friend and breaks my heart to see him in so much trouble. Lost his father recently because the girls family just wouldnt stop harrassments and kept sending goons at their place. We‚Äôre talking about Indian men in general. The vast majority of the creeps and assholes And why do you think the males in your family are the minority? Everyone is a creep except your father or brother? That‚Äôs not what I said You edited the reply. And no, men in my family are the role models of my life. Especially my Father, so yeah I would always speak against generalizing. Generalization will not help. Saying men can't be victims of this crime because many do commit such acts Is like saying you are a scammer because many have been found to be scammers. Doesn't help at all. >People like you are impossible to understand. Gaand mein se nikaal ke dimaag sir mein lagao thoda. Bro woke up and chose violence. Hate to go for the Low hanging fruit but you're a frequent poster in r/autism I don't feel any further discourse with you would lead to anything productive. They watched Daawat-e-Ishq and decided to enact in reality Better to let 10 guilty roam free then to have one innocent punished You think that‚Äôs a bad thing? lol bro autistics are more immune to idiotic hateful propaganda like this post. It‚Äôs neurotypicals who get crazy in a mob Misogynists are also ableist what a surprise. You‚Äôre a trash bag of a person and should accept that about yourself without trying to even avoid responsibility for it by saying ‚ÄúI hate to be a dick but I‚Äôm going to anyway‚Äù How about we jail the women with the same punishment after they are freed ? Seems fair right ? Whats the full story? (i don‚Äôt wanna sign up) So laws protecting women from harassment is nonsense? 1[Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.‚ÄîFor the purposes of this section, \"cruelty means\"‚Äî (a) anywilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or OP is a big liar. 1[Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.‚ÄîFor the purposes of this section, \"cruelty means\"‚Äî (a) anywilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or This is 498a code. I want to know how can you exactly misuse this law when there‚Äôs a requirement for proof of abuse. Are you a lawyer? Exactly. There are rules to protect against false accusations. It is. OP just want to be dramatic No. But giving unchecked legal power is What do you mean by unchecked legal power? There‚Äôs investigations and trials for the legitimacy of the case. Are you? Lol By the way, you have google to search for the procedure of the law before commenting nonsense 498a is non-bailable offence. It should be made bailable Lol. On what grounds? If he is falsely accused then how will he prove his innocence ? Bail gives temporary release and this will give him a chance to prove that he is not guilty Misuse of any legal provision, including Section 498A, is a concern. It's important to ensure that legal processes are followed correctly and that accusations are based on genuine grievances. Misuse can harm innocent individuals and undermine the credibility of the legal system. Did you even look at the link I shared? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The court ask for evidence of abuse upon which they investigate. They will only arrest if the court agree the accusations are true after the investigation. The accused can also defend their part with a lawyer if they believe they are falsely accused. Seriously you think police would just arrest people like that? Let me try to explain this in short. 498A was introduced to end dowry deaths I. E. women forced to commit suicide or tortured to near death. In such cases, police is expected to act proactively and with minimal input, as they essentially lead to a breakdown of society. Thus there is no qualification or requirement of abuse that needs to be met to file FIR by the plaintiff, as it is assumed police is doing so to to prevent such abuse. However, to convict the defendant, there are criterias to be met, as mentioned in the wording of the section. Now, when it comes to Court and the innocent has been in jail for a few weeks/months and the matter finally come to hearing to the Judicial Magistrate/Sessions Judge, they realize that there exists no proof of such crime in the first place, and the innocent is released. Which is why you end up with Courts frustrated with bad laws. By the time Court can step in to help and quash/discharge the case, months/years may have passed. Often, it is too late and many innocents are forced to commit suicide. Also, I don't understand what procedure you mean. Which section of CrPC are you talking about? If you care to read your own link, question 17 clearly states the police can arrest people indiscriminately and without a warrant from Court upon inkling of 498A. All that's needed is a complaint from the woman (Question 14, point ii). ‚ÄúTrial / Court Procedure under Section 498A As has been stated before, the trial or a criminal court procedure is initiated with the instance of an FIR or a police complaint. The detailed trial procedure has been given below: FIR (First Information Report) / Police complaint: the first step is a Police Complaint or a First Information Report. This is covered under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. An FIR puts the entire case into motion. Investigation and Report by Officer: The second step after the FIR, is investigation by the Investigation Officer. After the examination of the facts and circumstances, collection of evidence, and examination of persons and other necessary steps, the officer completes the investigation and prepares the investigation.‚Äù Read this and tell me what do you mean by ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no requirement of evidence‚Äù ‚ÄúInnocent has to be in jail‚Äù? dude, the court won‚Äôt arrest the accused unless the investigation proves he‚Äôs not innocent. You‚Äôre making this up. You do realize, and I'm repeating myself here, that in 498A, the police can arrest immediately and without warrant. And that secondly, to get this started 154 CrPC is the first and only step (mere oral complaint by complainant). Give me the proof of it. Either you‚Äôre misunderstanding or you‚Äôre denying the facts because you‚Äôre afraid of people facing consequences of their actions The police will arrest the accused without warrant IF the investigation proves he‚Äôs guilty I can smell a controversy building ups Once again, 498A of IPC is a NBCO (Non Bailable and Cognizable Offence). A Cognizable Offence is one which means the police will arrest anyone without a warrant or needing Court's permission/assessment. It's clear you have no understanding of the legal system and are simply basing your arguments on Google. I will refrain from commenting further. Wish you the best. ## Trial / Court Procedure under Section 498A As has been stated before, the trial or a criminal court procedure is initiated with the instance of an FIR or a police complaint. The detailed trial procedure has been given below: 1. **FIR (First Information Report) / Police complaint:** the first step is a Police Complaint or a First Information Report. This is covered under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. An FIR puts the entire case into motion. 2. **Investigation and Report by Officer:** The second step after the FIR, is investigation by the Investigation Officer. After the examination of the facts and circumstances, collection of evidence, and examination of persons and other necessary steps, the officer completes the investigation and prepares the investigation. 3. **Charge-sheet before Magistrate:** The police then files the charge sheet before the magistrate. The charge-sheet consists of all the criminal charges against the accused. 4. **Arguments before Court and Framing of Charges:** On the fixed date of hearing, the Magistrate hears the parties‚Äô arguments on the charges that have been set and then finally frames the charges. 5. **Plea of guilty:** Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 talks about the plea of guilty, after framing of the charges the accused is given an opportunity to plead guilty, and the responsibility lies with the judge to ensure that the plea of guilt was voluntarily made. The judge may upon its discretion convict the accused. 6. **Evidence by Prosecution:** After the framing of the charges and the accused pleading ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô, the evidence is first given by the Prosecution, upon whom the burden of proof initially (generally) lies. Both oral and documentary evidence can be produced. The magistrate has the power to issue summons to any person as a witness or order him to produce any document. 7. **Cross Examination of Witnesses by Accused/Counsel:** Witnesses of the prosecution when produced before the court are cross examined by the accused or his/her counsel. 8. **Evidence by Accused if any, in defence:** If the accused has any evidence, it is presented to the Courts at this stage. He/she is given this opportunity to make his/her case stronger. However, since the burden of proof is on the prosecution i.e. the alleged victim, the accused is not required to present evidence. 9. **Cross Examination of Witness by Prosecution:** If witnesses are produced by the defence, they will be cross-examined by the Prosecution. 10. **Conclusion of Evidence:** Once the court has been presented with evidence from both sides, the evidence is concluded by the Court/Judge. 11. **Oral / Final Arguments:** The final stage, nearing the judgement is the stage of final arguments. Here, both parties take turns (first, the prosecution and then the defence) and make final oral arguments in front of the judge. 12. **Judgement by the Court:** Based upon the facts and circumstances of that case, and upon the arguments made and evidence produced, the Court gives its final judgement. The Court gives its reasons in support of the acquittal or conviction of the accused and pronounces its final order. 13. **Acquittal or Conviction:** If the accused is held guilty, he/she is convicted and if held ‚Äònot-guilty‚Äô, the accused is acquitted in the final judgement. 14. **If Convicted, Hearing on Quantum of Sentence:** If the accused is held guilty and convicted, a hearing will take place to decide the quantum or extent of the Sentence or jail time. 15. **Appeal to Higher Courts:** An appeal to Higher Courts can be made if the scenario allows it. From Sessions court, an appeal can be made to the High Court and from High Court, to the Supreme Court. ## When Can A Person Be Held Guilty Under Section 498A, IPC? For a person to be held guilty under Section 498A, IPC it is important for the prosecution to compulsorily prove the following: 1. That the woman is married. This Section protects women from unruly and cruel behaviour that gets meted out to her in her marital home. 2. That the woman is subject to cruelty or harassment. Cruelty as discussed above can take on myriad forms. 3. That such cruelty or harassment is suffered by her at the hands of her husband or her in-laws or both. ## Is An Arrest Under Section 498a, Ipc, Automatic? There came a time when arrests under Section 498A, IPC became unnecessarily rampant and routinely automatic. They were effected with the menacing motives of disgruntled wives rather than as effective tools to aid police investigation. This malpractice was eventually checked by the Supreme Court of India, with the passage of judgements like Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014) and Rajesh Sharma v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2017), wherein the Hon‚Äôble Court while clearly recognising the gross misuse of Section 498A, IPC, issued guidelines to the Police while making arrests under the same. Accordingly, while investigating a 498A case, the Police instead of carrying out an automatic arrest of the accused are mandated to issue a notice to him under Section 41A, CrPC to join the ongoing investigation into the offence. Arrests are not mandated to be carried out under Section 498A, IPC if the accused continues to join such investigation, as and when called to do so. Hence, it was thus that unnecessary arrests by the Police were curbed by the Court. However, once the FIR is registered, it is better recommended to take anticipatory bail. When the accused moves the court for anticipatory bail, certain conditions may be imposed by the court upon him/her. Depositing a demand draft of a certain amount in the name of the wife or other dependents as a part of maintenance etc. could be one of the conditions. But, when there exists a specific provision for maintenance of wife and child, such conditional anticipatory bail granted under section 498A would go against the law. You may have missed the comment I pasted. The arrest are made when the accused to do not comply with the investigation. where does it day you need proof though? isnt every law supposed to be standing on its own? that , in my very very very humble opinion, means that the statement of the law has to be a self supporting sentence. Can you please explain this to me? No. The law doesn‚Äôt stand on its own. If it does, anyone could be charged without trial or investigation for any law. You didn‚Äôt answer my question though. Where does it say it you don‚Äôt need proof. Go to the procedure of the complaint. Read it and weep. > kept sending goons at their place. Yeah, I'd definitely get a door peephole, extra iron grill with a lock outside the main door, and atleast 1 gun to deal with goons. I always love watching a meltdown You're oozing with so much hate and carrying a lot of negativity on your chest, which must be burdensome. Here's to hoping you live a life free of victimhood and falsehoods, as most men are decent individuals. Wtf Yo dude thanks for this link! You‚Äôre totally fuckin‚Äô right - the complaint and FIR are registered, investigated and then brought in front of a magistrate who brings it to trial if evidence is provided. There‚Äôs this idea that the police will just pick up the husband or in-laws and put them in jail. Happened to my own neighbors, but my parents keep assuming they were never at fault. The fact that you have 22 downvotes shows you how pervasive this misogyny is. I know I am right. Look at how they stopped talking when I throw the facts at their faces. How the morons were whining about how the law is ‚Äúmisused‚Äù without researching is ridiculous. They don‚Äôt care about truth or justice. They hate that they can‚Äôt control women and they can‚Äôt get away from law if they force control over them. The casual rate at which spousal abuse is taken in India is fucking terrible. This mental_flight person needs to calm downüòÇ If a woman walks into the police station and say that her husband and in laws are mistreating her for dowry , police can put them behind bars immediately. Dude, Please don‚Äôt lie. Police didn‚Äôt do shit when my mother pleaded for their protection against my father‚Äôs abuse. Generally you will have to make a good case. A girl first went to her mom's place and broke some stuff asked her mom to slap her and went to PS and filed 498a. The boy was arrested immediately. SC advisory is not mandatory so it's the discretion of the officer. The arrest are made when physical violence is involved and fake complaints are lost in court but earlier there was lot of social stigma attached to it. People started ignoring the families against whom the complaint was filed. Things have changed now. But the misuse continues due to lack of policy Then why Calcutta, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Odisha, Supreme Court are echoing the same thing ? You‚Äôre wrong again. If you go to the link, you‚Äôll find the procedure for filing the complaint. You will also see that there‚Äôs a requirement for FIR, evidences upon which the officers investigate and determine if the accusation is fake or not. The boy was found guilty of assaulting the girl by the police. Either you‚Äôre cooking up the story or you were fed with lies All of these articles have paywalls to read full article. Get ones without pay wall Slow ?? It‚Äôs crawling like a toddler without direction or purpose! And the police force, forget about it. It‚Äôs like getting involved with them is a nightmare in itself. Most of them illogical beings who only to profess about some bullshit philosophy or corrupt to the core. Who would want to involve in these situations when someone else would quite easily raise an FIR for defamation when we whistle when we are trying to change the system for fairer laws ? Yes the system isn‚Äôt perfect, but who would even read this line anyways unless I put an emoji like this üòâ The last article said the some cases have been dismissed upon finding lack of evidences. So what? I can share the case number if you want. Evidence was there since she beat herself up. Accused can always defend themselves but in this section police resort to immediate arrest because people will pay bribes to stop their family to go to jail. Similarly for rape. The mere statement of women that consent was absent is enough. These have been changed by SC and in future all PS will learn proper course of action to protect both parties. Until then we will have collateral damage. At this point I don't know what are you defending?? It is well settled that women misuse this law and SC has taken action, action from parliament is missing. You are very butt hurt by your father's episode and I understand that it may be so because these are individual episodes and so was your's. Police in India cannot be trusted, they have lot's of tricks to harass and take bribes even though they know that the case will not stand in court. They do it because there will be no action against them. It seems you are not aware of how the system functions and blindly opposing anything because of previous experiences in life. Please do share. üò¨ If there were evidence of her beating herself and police chose to take immediate arrest then it‚Äôs the police‚Äôs fault. Not the laws. Lol. ‚ÄúMete statement is enough‚Äù? If that was case, how did these happen? >Seriously you think police would just arrest people like that? Haha. Of course they do. You haven't seen much, nothing wrong with that. This sounds like such a streamlined thing, clearly you've never dealt with anything close to it lol. I will go through the links. It seems you are immature. How will police know she beat herself up?? You have turned this conversation into a joke.I will take my leave here since you are just trolling it seems. Get serious in life. Haha, which world do you live in mate. You've never dealt with it I'd assume. Police pick up the guy before anything, moreover, it's a non-bailable offense. (incoming long paragraphs lol). You've made it sound such a streamlined process lol, how delusional. All the links you posted doesn't change anything about the misuse of law. It seems you are not aware of how law functions. What do you mean by misusing? I know you are lying because you didn‚Äôt mention the evidence or the bribe until now. You‚Äôre changing the story. You don‚Äôt even know the procedure of filing the complaint and the investigation. If police are so welcoming around the woman who want to file a charge against rape, why are there women still afraid to report the rape? Why are there police humiliating them? You are obviously butthurt by the laws taking actions against men that you are cooking up stories about fake accusations. Yes, I dealt with personally. No police ever arrested them the minute the case was filed. Yes, it‚Äôs a non bailable offence. You think the court give a slack the guilty ? Lol. (Incoming long paragraphs lol) Yes, it does. You just don‚Äôt want to admit it ü§° Sister you are out of depth here. The problems you are saying is faced by poor people. If you can afford 10k expenses which includes hiring a lawyer and court fees then police will take action otherwise they won't. There are lot of good officers where women have got justice but that experience is not shared across the country which is evident from the news reports you are sharing and court and parliament action regarding it. The same cannot be said for victims of 498a or 270. Then we have to agree to disagree because I am failing to understand your point. Dude, you said there were evidences of her beating up. Now you are telling me there‚Äôs none? Lol. I knew you were lying. So the problem is with the corrupt police. Not with the law. How do you those women in the articles I shared were poor people? Their identities weren‚Äôt revealed. This is a recognized issue. Police ask for money to take action. There are news articles, court citing, various activist and women help groups formed to help victims of backward socio economic background. What you are sharing is already known and I am not denying it. Humans are by nature corrupt but law is on the side of police when they resort to automatic arrest without warrant. This has to be rectified not by removing the law but by amending it so that the accused is not put behind bars automatically. Also I am not in favor of action against complainant because I know how tough it is to prove in court. It's not argument about whether a guilty person should be in prison or not, that's obvious, but on the non-guilty person being put behind bars. You have made big generalisations and written long paragraphs already to win some online argument, you aren't worth wasting any time on. Of course they are. Stop empowering them so much. political goons. cant stop them. my friend lives in a gated community with security and yet...his dad had multiple strokes as a direct result of this and ultimately took him."
