    "selftext": "&gt;Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is currently making its way through the northern skies and should reach its brightest magnitude in early February, [according to In-The-Sky.org](https://in-the-sky.org/comets/20230201_CK22E030_2.png)(opens in new tab) as it approaches perigee on Feb. 1. To see the comet for yourself, look to the north just after sunset and look for a faint greenish glow. Under the right dark sky conditions, the comet could be visible to the unaided eye, but [binoculars](https://www.space.com/26021-best-binoculars.html) will certainly make the job easier.\n\nCredits : [https://www.space.com/comet-c2022-e3-ztf-how-to-see-approach-earth](https://www.space.com/comet-c2022-e3-ztf-how-to-see-approach-earth)\n\nImage Credit &amp; [Copyright](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html#srapply): [Dan Bartlett](https://www.astrobin.com/users/h2ologg/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4flktstywea1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=df3279e1b38643708e54128fc8f9e8ca32e411cf",

        "It depends where you are staying. In big cities, it's almost impossible to see it because of light pollution. \n\nMaybe at the outskirts of the city you can see it on a clear night, with binoculars, as long as the moon is not too bright (new moon or crescent).",
        "Stellarium says you can see it tonight at 10:30 PM, at 15¬∞ declination (angle above the horizon) and 10¬∞ east from the north pole.\n\nIt'll reach peak declination of around 23¬∞ at 0¬∞ North at around 3 AM tomorrow. (These numbers are for Bangalore, btw. They'll slightly change depending on how high up you are from the equator)\n\nBut it's magnitude is only 5.5 which means it is among the faintest objects in the night sky. Even on its perigee on Feb 1st, the magnitude will only slightly improve to 5.4. So, I'm not sure if you'll be able to spot it in the city and without a binoculars.\n\nYou could install Stellarium on your phone and try your luck.",
