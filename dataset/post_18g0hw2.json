I highly doubt it but I can take the solace in the fact that if we ever worked as well as China does we can too. If there is any country which can break US's hegemony on the world, its China and I dont think US can do anything.  \n\n\nP.S.

        "Based on all the indices, India is 11-18 years behind where China is today. Does that mean India will look like this 18 years from now? Definitely not. \n\nWhile you can blame the governance apathy, people's lack of civic sense, etc., one of the biggest hurdles (in a good and a bad way) is democracy. \n\nI live in Dubai which is a kingdom. The government has steadfastly improved infrastructure, and has been investing in everything that will make Dubai compete with the best across different sectors. \n\nThe con with a kingdom is that it depends on the King/Queen. A Tughlaqian ruler may have taken the country in the opposite direction, again with very little resistance.\n\nChina with its autocratic governance too is.\n\nWith a democracy, you sort of stay in the middle and are able to move on steadily. But the problem is there is too much resistance to anything. Dubai was able to carve out an entire island off the sea. Disregarding the pluses and minuses of it, a similar project in India will never take off because of opposition from environmentalists. Even constructing a road off the sea coast in Mumbai has faced so much hurdle, despite the fact that the alternative is for millions in congested traffic pumping out harmful gases out of their vehicles  every single day. \n\nThere is no point in wishing we were autocratic, or a better democracy. It is what it is, and we learn to live with what we have.",
        "And India is debt free? For all the debt we have, what have we got to show for it apart from one individual becoming the richest man in the world?",
        "Indices do not tell you the whole story or infact any story beyond meaningless numbers. While our per capita GDP may just be 3 times smaller our population is much poorer because the divide between the rich and poor is huge. This is also explains the difference between consumption numbers. For e.g. Mercedes sells more than half a million cars in China every year and they sell an average of 17000 (yes thousand) in India in a year. Basically Chinese buy more mercedes in a month than we in India do in 5 years!  Also the fact that 800 million people in India need government to provide food grains for their daily sustenance.",
        "What about this is propaganda?",
        "You are saying that as if China is so communist, everyone makes the same wages in the country. They have their own wage gap between the rich and the poor. \n\nAnd what Mercedes sells is immaterial. How many Mahindras do they buy? Brands have different positioning, pricing, popularity and market share in every geography. It's meaningless. \n\nAlso the fact that the new Chinese cities may be car-centric forcing people to spend money on cars while Indian cities, even the most modern areas, are still motorable by cycles and bikes. \n\nIndices do not tell the whole story, but they tell you a good enough indication of the trajectory",
        "I donâ€™t know, India has lots of debts too ? For doing what ?",
        "This. This chalta hai attitude and accepting the fate is what that has made today's India a shithole that has become. We elect most corrupt, criminals as our leaders to lead us and then sit out and complain why we aren't making progress .",

        "*\" And what Mercedes sells is immaterial. How many Mahindras do they buy? Brands have different positioning, pricing, popularity and market share in every geography. It's meaningless.\"*  \nWhy is it immaterial? A car is an aspirational purchase in India and luxury brands even more so. They signal to the world that you have arrived. We are similar sized population wise. Chinese economy is 6 times bigger than Indian economy so our consumption pattern should be relatively similar, assuming all else is equal meaning we should be buying atleast 1/6th of what Chinese consumers are buying. But we are not. We are 1/6th of the 1/6th. I should not even have to write so much - just go out on the street even in a major city and see the poverty all around. Rural India is even worse off.",
        "India has higher debt to gdp percentage than China by the way",
        "You are contradicting yourself. \n\nIf Mercedes is such a luxury brand, and China has so many of them (meaning there are so many rich people who can afford it), then it only means that there are a good number of poor people to weigh the averages down, don't you think? \n\nAnd yet, you say wealth-poor gap in India is causing GDP per capita to be skewed. \n\nIndians and Chinese are two different demographics. What appeals to them is not the same as what appeals to us, simply because there are a multiple of factors at play here. \n\nIn India. people have a lot of trust in local manufacturers (not because of the brand appeal, but because we know a Maruti and Mahindra spare part can be so easily obtained compared to foreign parts). So a lot of even the ultra-wealthy black money hoarders will go for a Tata or Maruti than foreign brands (which too have begun to pick up by the way). \n\nGo out on the streets and see is not an answer. As I mentioned in my opening post, India is a democracy - we can afford to not hide our poverty, unlike China where everything is embellished to look better. \n\nAgain, my point is not that India is as good as China. If you think that is my point, reread to get what I mean.",
        "Democracy can't have growth like china.\n\nToo much freedom gives too much obstacles for progress",
        "It's been dragged to around 19% now from mid-20%s in late 2010s. They intentionally deflated this, which spooked the usual Gordan Chang-esque Western commentators that China or it's Economy is Collapsing, when the reality was it was/IS being done intentionally.",
        "Benevolent Emperor vs Bad Emperor Problem. Quite well-known historical and philosophical but also a Real-world problem/challenge/question.\n\nA monarchy though has higher odds of going bad since parent-child need not always be similarly competent and secondly and critically IF one gets a Bad Emperor in such a System it lasts longer because mechanism to remove such leaders is harder (they're actually rulers for Life not just figuratively/rhetorically).\n\nHowever if the System itself is tuned in a way that mandates Term-Age Limits then a massive obstacle to that philosophical question gets removed since EVEN IF a bad emperor comes they can not stay beyond a certain time frame.\n\nAnd lastly, such Systems (usually Monarchy but its within that spectrum) have been norm throughout human history for a reason. It's so because Even When they mess up with bad leaders/policies or what not, because the System is not Hyper-Stable (like Democractic System is) it means it can easily break up and be formed again under new Leadership.\n\nWhat this does is, create more number of cycles (good & bad) but because the Good Cycles has higher upper ceilings, it recovers quickly. More quickly than what a Democractic System with it's stagnant growth can achieve. So in X long number of years, the former system either is at same place as Democracy or much higher level.\n\nSystems Debate has become taboo in West and that has percolated into Western narrative dominated societies like India as well. Fukuyama virus in action.\n\nHistory as matter of fact is NOT Dead or Over. China proved it.\n\nHumans have NOT exhausted their experimentation with Governance Systems. Only human collectives that have the balls to dare make it. This is a known constant that human history itself is witness to.",
        "So he is cherry-picking a bit in the video. New York infrastructure is probably mediocre in America.  For context, I live in LA california, and it's not that bad. The issue is that there's is almost no real public infrastructure in the states. It's a car driven infrastructure. And we probably won't be able to pivot out of it without radical changes. TLDR : our infrastructure is rapidly aging, so it's only going to get worse over time. Because every project here is 3x over budget 2x longer time frame. The issue is that the U.S spends way too much on the military and the broken health care system. Which only benefits the top 1% of elite Americans. My personal gripe is that public service is in decline because  everything is being commoditized for profit. California spent over a hundred billion for a high-speed rail line from SD to sf. And we barely got anything to show for it. I'm certain that in the coming decades, it'll still be entirely plane and car focused.",

Because every project here is 3x over budget 2x longer time frame. The issue is that the U.S spends way too much on the military and the broken health care system. Which only benefits the top 1% of elite Americans. My personal gripe is that public service is in decline because everything is being commoditized for profit. California spent over a hundred billion for a high-speed rail line from SD to sf. And we barely got anything to show for it. I'm certain that in the coming decades, it'll still be entirely plane and car focused. \\>While our per capita GDP may just be 3 times smaller our population is much poorer because the divide between the rich and poor is huge China has higher income inequality than India (Check the gini coefficient). Where did you even get your data? This source says China has 83% while India has 81.9% Source: wtf is the debt spent on ? This is based on available data. You also have to factor in black money and the fact that India is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Using GINI coefficient is way better way of assessing income inequality than this data You should really get better sources. China's infrastructure ranks quite low and the stuff you're watching is propaganda from the CCP. Not accurate at all to the reality."
