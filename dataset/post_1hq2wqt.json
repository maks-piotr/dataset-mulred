        "IKEA can't beat that neighborhood marwari furniture waala in terms of pricing, quality and even trust to an extent.",
        "Because ikeaâ€™s entire business model works only in the west. It works there because cost of labor is more than cost of materials.\n\nFundamental reason ikea is cheap in the west is because it is not assembled. When you assemble it at home, you are doing the job of someone who would have to be paid $25 an hour at some factory. So by assembling it yourself you are that cost. Second important thing is, itâ€™s cheaper to transport a disassembled table compared to an assembled one. It takes a lot less space, so cost of transport is cheaper too. IKEA can fit like 10x more items into a shipping container from China compared to assembled stuff.\n\nIn India, labor is so cheap, the advantage first point gets is almost zero.  \n\nIKEA furniture in the west are considered cheap, entry level. There is literally no furniture store thatâ€™s cheaper than ikea.",
        "the quality of thier furniture is shit! Bought a couple of units and both have developed issues in just 2-3 years!",
        "In fact \"Urban company\" has a category Furniture Assembly.",
        "Open a store in Delhi and the losses will be recovered in no time.",
        "So sad for the billion dollar company",
        "Mumbai region itself had three stores and they had shut down one of them.",
        "IKEA is not a status symbol, they should have changed the marketing strategy in india",
        "Very well put, the only reason ikea even has any sales is due to indians having a brand mentality.",
        "Their business model is flawed, they only open a few centers in the south and their online stores are have literally no marketing.   \nWhen was the last time you saw an ad of Ikea or even a flash sale?   \nEveryone knows when Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio etc will have a major sales event and there is almost always a flash sale at anytime you visit their page.  \nThey think they are Mercedes, BMW brands who need no advertising?",
        "Good riddence. Nothing was cheap there and quality wise it's bad. Almost feel like the defective ones that they get aboard are shipped here to India to earn from the reject stock as well.",
        "IKEA is budget furniture in the west. If they price it similar to Indian markets, it wouldâ€™ve become successful in the metros",
        "I have seen plenty of IKEA ads, not sure why you havenâ€™t been getting them.",
        "There are lot of western companies which are supposed to be budget stores, but they arenâ€™t in India and we canâ€™t blame them.",
        "The losses are coming from capex. The depreciation on the balance sheets is the major drags on their P&L.\n\nTheir actual sales volumes are only growing and once they meet their investment targets the losses will start reversing course.",
        " They are competing with an unstructured but very strong hold traditional carpentry businesses. These small carpenters are cheaper and easy to reach out. Besides that, in India, people still believe that furniture has a long shelf life. If something is broken, it should be \"repaired\" rather than \"replaced\". Ikea model is yet to get acceptance as the customer mindset does not align with their product strategy.",
        "Ikea biz model of USA and 1st world where the roads does exist - wonâ€™t work in India.\n\nFor instance- for most of the Bangalore folks going to ikea store in Bangalore is a day trip - itâ€™s not the distance but the traffic bcz\n\n\nIkea needs to Innovate per Indian market reality",
        "India is not a place they would want to sell coz we are a very budgeted and old-school country when it comes to furniture IKEA can be a little expensive and what most people do is they click pictures and will get it done by a local contractor in 10yrs down the line due to generational shift sales may get steady",
        ">When was the last time you saw an ad of Ikea or even a flash sale?\n\nFirst time I'm hearing ikea is in India",
        "Ikea has low quality furniture for students in the west. It looks good but falls apart after a year or two. It's not supposed to last.\n\nIndians mostly don't work like that. Even our inexpensive wooden/cane furniture is made to last. I've seen dovetail joints on plywood furniture made in India. I have a dining table set from the late '60's and it still looks great. Perfectly functional except the veneer has faded with time. A cane sofa set has been around for at least 35 years that I can remember and still going strong. Some people even buy second hand furniture if they can't afford good quality new ones, and refurbish it. \n\nThe Ikea model won't work because the equivalent consumer in India would be a student, slum dwellers or lower middle class. All groups that cannot afford Ikea prices. Their prices dictate at least a middle income to upper middle income consumer, who is much more picky and demands better quality.",
        "Yes, but this still begs the question, why does Ikea feel the need to import disassembled furniture from China to India? why can't it make disassembled furniture here and sell it here, to compete with the local market here? I find it difficult to understand why Ikea can't compete against local furniture.",
        "I also see lots of ikea ads, but maybe this is only a Bangalore/Hyderabad thing. I donâ€™t ikea advertises in cities they arenâ€™t present in.",
        "This. Meanwhile their competitors market like crazy. Their target audience is literally not aware that IKEA exists",
        "A 15% loss in the first few years is not staggering by any means. Amazon India, uber India, ola, flipkart, paytm are all unprofitable. \n\nThat's just the business model of growth companies. If you read the article, ikea are setting up a few more stores to reach the scale they want. \n\nYou guys need to stop writing pessimistic tales at every opportunity you get without understanding the nuances. No MNC is ready to leave India. They just keep ploughing profits from their global op to India. That should tell you something.",
        "I have see people take ikea designs and get it done cheaper from local carpenters. Those carpenters then pitch those designs to other people who havenâ€™t visited IKEA. You canâ€™t beat Indian jugaad.",
        "I live main at the north side of India (Delhi, Punjab, Bengal, Assam, NE states) never seen an ikea ad online or offline",
        "It's the locally sourced items rule of the government that is killing them. If they were a US company their government would have put pressure on the Indian government and had the rule removed.",
        "IKEA will fail in India unless it adapts to Indian specific conditions.\n\nThey opened a few stores in the South, refuse to deliver online and most importantly, aren't expanding in T2 and T3 towns. \n\nIndia isn't like western countries where someone would drive 200km in his own pickup truck to acquire the furniture and assemble it themselves.",
        "McDolands is also a budget restaurant  in the west",
        "In the same rhetoric, Amazon and Flipkart started with competing with very strong local/neighborhood grocery stores who also had a free home delivery service and any product found damaged or unsatisfactory could be exchanged immediately, but today the online store have take a massive chunk out of the daily sales of these same store, all because of marketing , pricing and availability.",
        "Exactly. When I bought my first furniture, a cupboard, I bought engineered wood because it was cheaper. During installation I regretted buying it because it was not sturdy. The next time I went to the local carpenter. I get a sense of pride while using it. I made it to last generations. Just like the items my father made with his hard earned money and gave to me.",
        "I bought an ikea bedside small table. And spent 1 hour last night assembling it. Maybe my 1 hour long curses made them go bankrupt! ðŸ˜¬",
        "Why don't they ship to other cities outside their store locations? For example, NCR has huge demand for their stuff but they do not ship. They could tie up with someone if they don't want to themselves. If they are not keen in expanding their market, of course sales would fall.",
        "Also the quality of food in Indian McDonald's is bad compared to European McDonald's.",
        "They dont even deliver outside of their home cities. That's a dead in the water strategy.",
        "Strangely, Indian McD >>>>> US McD",

        "Realized that IKEA is a luxury brand in India, nope my neighborhood badhai is way better Sir.",
        "I read it a few days back that IKEA model works in the West where labour is expensive so mass manufactured factory furniture is cheaper in comparison. While it's a different story in India, labour is very (very very very) affordable here and getting something made is relatively cheaper.",
        "Local carpenters can create Ikea designs for me for half the cost using thick plywood and veneer. Particle board is used in practically every Ikea product, which will start creaking within 2 years.\nIndian carpenters are underrated for their skill.\n\nI also bought a custom-designed wardrobe from a nearby factory, they used  robust steel gauges on the item.",
        "In terms of quality -\nFurniture: mostly cheap engineered wood. Local shops or even Urbanladder provide better quality.\nIn terms of variety & pricing-\nDecor: they do have those minimalist items, but online availability is a challenge. The ones in Mumbai Bangalore have to literally go on a full day trip which is not doable. \nI did buy some good vases and plant pots which turned out good.\nOrganisers: some of them are cheap cardboard, those which are good are not priced right.\nLighting: overpriced. Local marwari guy selling at half the price. \nCrockery & kitchen utensils: I think these are priced right, I really like their glass & plastic containers along with the plates mugs etc. \n\nBottom line, they need to price those items right.",
        "McD is budget in India too compared to astronomically priced decent cafes and restaurants now.",
