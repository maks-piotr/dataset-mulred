        "Same for patients at government hospital",
        "As a user of your app, and as a developer, I can appreciate all the hard work that goes into this. Giving a 1 star rating on grounds of not making it open source is ridiculous, but what can you do? To open source or not, is entirely your call.\n\n\"Greedy\" is uncalled for. You just work on donations, right? I'd encourage all users to donate, this app does what many paid apps don't do as well.",
        "Others can't verify if your app does exactly what it claims if it isn't open-sourced.\n\nThat being said, he way of putting it was most certainly wrong.",
        "Yes. I'm not saying what he intended to convey was wrong, but the way to put it across was.\n\nBy the way, i think folks can do some network monitoring to validate some of the claims.",
        "Yes. My plan is to not open source as long as I'm actively working on it. If I plan to give it up, I'd happily open source it to keep the product alive and just help in regular release.\n\nThe app currently does work on donations, but I'm also adding premium features for the advanced users to establish long term monetory feasibility.",
        "You can use traffic monitors to validate what end points the app call and what data is sent out of the app. I think that would validate some of the claims.",
        "Black box is gonna a black box and even network monitoring can never give the full picture.\n\nIf you don't plan on making money form the app, please consider making it open-source and publishing it on F-Droid under GPL-3 license (IIRC, it forces its forks to be open-source as well). \n\nFOSS community has helped a lot of under-privileged people, like me, to grow eg- VLC, Blender, Krita etc. and needs talented people like you.",
        "I can help you with UI/UX given that i will receive credits. But beyond that, if you wanted help with developing a revenue model etc. then i would want to be compensated for the work and share in revenue.",
        "Hey! I am completely fine with giving you credits for your work.\n\nWe currently don't make enough revenue, so my current goal is to make the product monetary feasible and invest in the product, but if you plan to stay with the product long term, we can look onto revenue sharing. Feel free to DM me!",
        "Wait! I can monitor what data is sent out? Aren't these calls encrypted?  If not, then that is a serious issue irrespective of the content that is  being transferred.",
        "I just installed your app a while ago. Love it, though yet to migrate everything to it. Yes, I found some bugs but you are doing it free and as a developer I know how hard that is and I appreciate it. \n\nI support open source too, but it's your app and it's up to you if you want to make it open source or not. No one should demand like this. \n\nSo for every rude person like this, please know that there are people downloading and appreciating.",
        "I think there are licenses to prevent that, but yeah, people may not respect it",
        "Thank you for trying it out. Do reach out to me via DM or on email, and let me know, if possible, what bugs you're facing and I can look into them. \n\nLots of new features and improvements coming this year! :)",
        "Happy to hear the future monetization plan. Could you add this plan somewhere on app site?. When I installed, I was bit worried what was the plan and whether you might in future resort to selling data, but then I decided to trust merely because you seemed genuine here. I wondered how someone could build all this ( all those imports from shitty government excels, you are a saint! ) and not charge money. Having a statement of who you are, why you do this and what are the monetization plans would help reassure potential users.",
        "&gt; I don't know much about Open Source licenses, \n\nSo why are you advising people about which licence to use?",
        "How do you even compare the two? Patients are paying tax (income tax, gst, etc) which goes toward funding public institutions such as government offices and hospitals.",
        "I will work on a web landing page soon, and incorporate this suggestion there. Thank you for putting this out here.",
        "You can intercept api calls from an app before they are encrypted.",
        "If you are going to open source it, use a license like GPL so they must also open source their work",
        "Most patients who come to government hospitals don‚Äôt pay income tax",
        "I will keep this in mind, thank you!",
        "There are other kinds of tax too. If you purchase anything, you're paying gst.\n\n&gt; Most patients who come to government hospitals don‚Äôt pay income tax\n\nDo you have a source for this claim?",
        "This is the deal with an offer that‚Äôs open to the world. The laws of statistics require that you will have some jerks to deal with. Hopefully this one has done his worst and will leave you in peace. I trust you will find more reasonable users as well.",
        "Great stuff, what did you make it with? I mean the techstack.",
        "It's native Java. Mostly client side, with some firebase components.",
        "man i want to use it, but playstore doesnt let me install it on my google pixel 4a in germany. you got an idea?\n\nInstall button is there, but white-greenish and cant click it",
        "Nice nice, I am currently doing ReactJS but want to do mobile development, Do you think React Native is a good idea?",
        "Hey! Personally I'm a bit biased towards native development, so I'm not the right person to ask. \n\nBut, I've heard good things about React. You could also check out Flutter.",
        "Could you check your Android version?",
        "Android 12",
        "That seems weird. The app is marked as available in Germany. Is there a specific error that you get? Can you share a screenshot?",
        "Mmmh didn't work from desktop browser.\nBut works on phone itself :) \n\nThe app looks really good!!!\nBut it's looks focused on to the Indian market... Any chance to change currency? And have more indices?",
        "We are already working on allowing multi currency. Will be available in beta this week, and on the stable version early next month. \n\nWe'll add more indices and markets this year starting with the US in a couple of months. What indices are you interested in?",
        "No particular indexes. Thank you"

They can be, but even closed source bank systems are audited and certified by third parties. Ex: PCI DSS compliance etc. which is the next best thing. Are we talking GPL violation or something else ? If GPL violation than it can be easily resorted. You won't have to go to court. They would be rejected by the community itself. Yes i don't think most banks would do it either if they don't see any benefit. Large corps either open source for image makeover and for sake of the community but not everyone is onboard with that idea. Don‚Äôt be disheartened, we need more people like you to spearhead good software and good ideologies. Wow, that was a very smart ad. You got a download from me. I hope it would be worth your while. But to be honest, i wanted the post to reach the person, and hopefully he'd reconsider the rating since every 1 star affects my store rating drastically. Although, few people here have been really generous to rate the app on the store to help. Bhai tu link de de. I'll give your app 5 stars from all of my family's accounts. DMed. Thanks! Don't take this to heart. As a PM, I can surely assure you, you'll get more such people in future. Chill out. Hey what is the app? It's called Artos. Gave 5 stars xD Reported the two recent 1 stars for being spam. Thank you so much! I think in the heat of the moment, I was disheartened. I have been trying to understand this but haven't been able to. Do you know how to get access to these APIs? You look into GitHub organization and private repos. I used it once, at that time I saw you can fine tune who you invite inthe organization and how much access he has on each repo. I don't know much about Open Source licenses, but if and when you do decide to open source your app, go for a GPL license - it mandates that if someone uses your code and adds something to it, they have to make it available in the public domain. Thank you for your kind words! Means a lot! Never knew there is something called Investment Tracker to track all the the investments etc. üòÅ Thanks, I'll give it a try and definitely leave a good review. Thanks! Feel free to reach out to me if you face any issues or have a feature request! Sure! Thank you. Tbh, how is someone supposed to believe that you are not collecting any data Same for patients at government hospital As a user of your app, and as a developer, I can appreciate all the hard work that goes into this. Giving a 1 star rating on grounds of not making it open source is ridiculous, but what can you do? To open source or not, is entirely your call. \"Greedy\" is uncalled for. You just work on donations, right? I'd encourage all users to donate, this app does what many paid apps don't do as well. Others can't verify if your app does exactly what it claims if it isn't open-sourced. That being said, he way of putting it was most certainly wrong. Yes. I'm not saying what he intended to convey was wrong, but the way to put it across was. By the way, i think folks can do some network monitoring to validate some of the claims. Yes. My plan is to not open source as long as I'm actively working on it. If I plan to give it up, I'd happily open source it to keep the product alive and just help in regular release. The app currently does work on donations, but I'm also adding premium features for the advanced users to establish long term monetory feasibility. You can use traffic monitors to validate what end points the app call and what data is sent out of the app. I think that would validate some of the claims. Black box is gonna a black box and even network monitoring can never give the full picture. If you don't plan on making money form the app, please consider making it open-source and publishing it on F-Droid under GPL-3 license (IIRC, it forces its forks to be open-source as well). FOSS community has helped a lot of under-privileged people, like me, to grow eg- VLC, Blender, Krita etc. and needs talented people like you. I can help you with UI/UX given that i will receive credits. But beyond that, if you wanted help with developing a revenue model etc. then i would want to be compensated for the work and share in revenue. Hey! I am completely fine with giving you credits for your work. We currently don't make enough revenue, so my current goal is to make the product monetary feasible and invest in the product, but if you plan to stay with the product long term, we can look onto revenue sharing. Feel free to DM me! Wait! I can monitor what data is sent out? Aren't these calls encrypted? If not, then that is a serious issue irrespective of the content that is being transferred. I just installed your app a while ago. Love it, though yet to migrate everything to it. Yes, I found some bugs but you are doing it free and as a developer I know how hard that is and I appreciate it. I support open source too, but it's your app and it's up to you if you want to make it open source or not. No one should demand like this. So for every rude person like this, please know that there are people downloading and appreciating. I think there are licenses to prevent that, but yeah, people may not respect it Thank you for trying it out. Do reach out to me via DM or on email, and let me know, if possible, what bugs you're facing and I can look into them. Lots of new features and improvements coming this year! :) Happy to hear the future monetization plan. Could you add this plan somewhere on app site?. When I installed, I was bit worried what was the plan and whether you might in future resort to selling data, but then I decided to trust merely because you seemed genuine here. I wondered how someone could build all this ( all those imports from shitty government excels, you are a saint! ) and not charge money. Having a statement of who you are, why you do this and what are the monetization plans would help reassure potential users. &gt; I don't know much about Open Source licenses, So why are you advising people about which licence to use? How do you even compare the two? Patients are paying tax (income tax, gst, etc) which goes toward funding public institutions such as government offices and hospitals. I will work on a web landing page soon, and incorporate this suggestion there. Thank you for putting this out here. You can intercept api calls from an app before they are encrypted. If you are going to open source it, use a license like GPL so they must also open source their work Most patients who come to government hospitals don‚Äôt pay income tax I will keep this in mind, thank you! There are other kinds of tax too. If you purchase anything, you're paying gst. &gt; Most patients who come to government hospitals don‚Äôt pay income tax Do you have a source for this claim? This is the deal with an offer that‚Äôs open to the world. The laws of statistics require that you will have some jerks to deal with. Hopefully this one has done his worst and will leave you in peace. I trust you will find more reasonable users as well. Great stuff, what did you make it with? I mean the techstack. It's native Java. Mostly client side, with some firebase components. man i want to use it, but playstore doesnt let me install it on my google pixel 4a in germany. you got an idea? Install button is there, but white-greenish and cant click it Nice nice, I am currently doing ReactJS but want to do mobile development, Do you think React Native is a good idea? Hey! Personally I'm a bit biased towards native development, so I'm not the right person to ask. But, I've heard good things about React. You could also check out Flutter. Could you check your Android version? Android 12 That seems weird. The app is marked as available in Germany. Is there a specific error that you get? Can you share a screenshot? Mmmh didn't work from desktop browser. But works on phone itself :) The app looks really good!!! But it's looks focused on to the Indian market... Any chance to change currency? And have more indices? We are already working on allowing multi currency. Will be available in beta this week, and on the stable version early next month. We'll add more indices and markets this year starting with the US in a couple of months. What indices are you interested in? No particular indexes. Thank you"
