It's there in the constitution.\n\nGovt decided to use that name on the G20 invites.\n\nMedia decided to make a news story out of it. Perhaps because they were told to.\n\nNow everyone is talking about it.\n\nFirst govt announces special session of Parliament but not the agenda. Typical theatrics like some reality TV show.\n\nMedia that won't cover real issues start speculating- some say it's about UCC, then it's about early election, then it's  about one nation election and now changing the name of the country!\n\nThis is the power the govt wields and godi media obliges.\n\nI don't know if it's a matter of throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks for a campaign narrative, keeping the population disoriented or just testing how much of the narrative they can control all prior to the election.\n\nJust because someone wriggles their finger, don't start dancing like that finger is up your ass.\n\nA little less speculation, a little more restraint please.\n\nSave your energy for when we have enough information to act on whether that's at the election booth or elsewhere.",

        "No, I am specifically talking about your sentence that “foreigners will never acknowledge it”.\n\nThere are examples of this being done before - eg. Persia -> Iran. Ceylon -> Colombo. Burma -> Myanmar. Rhodesia -> Zimbabwe\n\nAll have eventually caught on. Turkey -> Türkiye is too new (Just like Bangalore to Bengaluru or Allahabad to Prayagraj is). Not enough time has passed cite either of these examples of “failed” name changes.\n\nIf you are bringing the cost angle then it’s a different issue. Unless though you want to make wholesale changes from day 1 (which would not make sense) there would not be costs involved. For example we do not need to rename institutions having the India in it. Nor do we need to do anything like a currency call back etc - the existing currency can be kept and just the new currency being printed can have the name change etc. the names of existing institutions can be kept and the names of new institutions can incorporate the word Bharat. Eventually (after a few years) existing institutional names may be changed as well.\n\nExisting campaigns such as Make in India etc can be continued. New campaigns can include the name Bharat etc (which, I will point out already happened in the past eg: Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan, BharatNet etc)\n\nThe difference with Germany and Japan here is that all the institutions within Germany and Japan use their official names “Deutschland” or “Nippon”. The names Germany and Japan mostly appear only in English language and some other European languages (and not consistently, Germany is called Alemania in Spanish). English is not the official language or either Germany or Japan so it doesn’t really matter what it is called in English to either.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "To those worried about the country being renamed Bharat",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Wait. Just wait. Nothing of the sort has been suggested. Bharat is another name for India. It's there in the constitution. Govt decided to use that name on the G20 invites. Media decided to make a news story out of it. Perhaps because they were told to. Now everyone is talking about it. First govt announces special session of Parliament but not the agenda. Typical theatrics like some reality TV show. Media that won't cover real issues start speculating- some say it's about UCC, then it's about early election, then it's about one nation election and now changing the name of the country! This is the power the govt wields and godi media obliges. I don't know if it's a matter of throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks for a campaign narrative, keeping the population disoriented or just testing how much of the narrative they can control all prior to the election. Just because someone wriggles their finger, don't start dancing like that finger is up your ass. A little less speculation, a little more restraint please. Save your energy for when we have enough information to act on whether that's at the election booth or elsewhere.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "G20 is not the only instance. It was also used for the PM's visit to the ASEAN Summit. Granted that it's the same ministry in both cases but this is certainly weird. Someone just doesn't do it randomly, twice. We also have celebs advancing the use of Bharat and it's no secret that that BJP's IT Cell ropes in celebs to set a positive narrative for their actions. Nothing to suggest that the special session is about this or that the government will for a formal dropping of the name India but there certainly seems to be a new policy in place. The government is doing it out of pettiness because the opposition is named INDIA Bet he'll still sit on tables saying Prime Minister of India Also to be noted that 'President of Bharat' isn't adhering to any official language. It could be either 'President of India' or 'Bhartiya Rastrapati'. The fact that they tried to use 'President of Bharat' instead of 'Bhartiya Rastrapati' (if they want to use the other name) is raising eyebrows if they are trying to legitimise the use of Bharat instead of India. From a common sense POV, yes. But there is nothing stating that it can not be used in English. Or that India can not be used in Hindi. At least I couldn't find anything. The closest is that while written in Roman Script it should be Bhārat. That's it. Well we have never seen either used in the other language in the past, so what prompted them now? This is just going to fuel another narrative of India v Bharat, Us v Them in the media. When celebrities start tweeting about it before the fact, something is definitely cooking. Media is saying Govt will pass a RESOLUTION. Resolutions are not laws, and have no legal standing. Maybe this resolution will say \"Bharat\" will be used by the Govt in officail communications - like \"Government of India\", \"Prime Minister of Bharat\" etc., without amending Article 1 to drop \"India\" as people are assuming Media is saying Govt will pass a RESOLUTION. Resolutions are not laws, and have no legal merit. Maybe this resolution will say \"Bharat\" will be used by the Govt in official communications - like \"Government of Bharat\", \"Prime Minister of Bharat\" etc., without amending Article 1 to drop India, as people are assuming September 18, 1949 - Constituent Assembly adopted \"India, that is Bharat\" in the Constitution September 18, 2023 - first day of special session Something is definitely brewing We can change our name to whatever we want but will foreigners acknowledge it??. We will still be called \"indians\" not \"bhartiya\" abroad. Every writing,book, and reference towards India will not be changed to \"Bharat\". So the government spending 14000(est cost) is just their 2024 advert but through taxpayers money Absolutely not. It's their Jumla. Not going to happen. Imagine the cost they'll have to bear to change such a thing. More than a billion dollars ffs. Govt is rattled. So, it's their coping mechanism. What? Who tweeted? Any links? Ram Mandir was called a jumla, Inauguration is a week before elections Spending where? One nation: Bharat One people: Bhartiya One party: Bhartiya Janta Party One leader: Adani Well if it becomes official then documents ,government bodies etc. Implementing it won't be cheap. Just changing the city name costs around 500-700cr just imagine the scale of changing the whole country's name. That's the thing. They don't have to change much to still forward this agenda. Don't 'change' anything, just start using Bharat in English Govt. Notifications. Use Bharat in the name of new acts (like in the case of new IPC) and that's it. Just this much and their Jumla is successful. Doesn't even have to reach the Parliament for just this much. Thank you. I live in constant fear of this being true and the inevitable tweet by Vir Das about how he was right all along about there being two nations. It's funny how it's the Bharatiya Janata Party and not the Indian People's Party. Exactly. Nothing will happen. Except invitations, id cards, notices, etc. Media will run tgis for a week and it will die down. As far as extra parliament session, it is most likely about one nation one election. Exactly. The media was probably told to spoon this angle, and now everyone is going bawla over it. The real question is - what is the *real* news that is being covered up under this farce? That's okay. The constitution allows both the names to coexist. Many things have 'India' in it. Now they're going to use Bharat in few of them(the major ones probably). It's just that people are repulsed by the idea of de-recognising 'India' completely and therefore prohibiting it's usage entirely. That's would be really sad. Hope that doesn't happen. lol array bhaiya. modi will always release hints of new laws but not discuss policy. the bill will be introduced in parliament and passed the same day without discussion. you want us to save our breath for the protests after the bill is passed? > Well we have never seen either used in the other language in the past, so what prompted them now? This is just going to fuel another narrative of India v Bharat, Us v Them in the media. Go and see the logo (Hindi version) of Indian Oil Corporation. Its literally right there. You know, the name \"Bombay\" was changed to \"Mumbai\" not even 30 years ago. it is now universally used not only in India but also abroad. Yes, some institutions which had \"Bombay\" in its name such as IIT-Bombay, Bombay High Court, Bombay Stock Exchange etc. retained \"Bombay\" in its name . Some others such as University of Mumbai etc. changed the name. But by and large, the name change has been successful in terms of its adoption nationally as well as internationally. Yes that’s the correct reason. And guess why would they call it bharat ? BHARATiya janta party. There you go. Non-stop Distractive Activities. Desh ka bhala na karoonga, na karne doonga. Can you blame people for speculating. Demonetization was an unexpected fuck you, the media is an incompetent puppet and most of the Indians are polarized and brainwashed. INC is - Indian National Congress BJP is - Bharathiya Janatha Party BJP just want people to use more of Bharat and less of India. My guess is that they will be using Bharat for all the positive news and India for all negative news. Ex - Bharat is the third largest economy India is the rape capital (just giving an example) I dont trust the govt after demonetization. Gobi is crazy False equivalence, city and country are different scale altogether. Turkey was changed to türkiye Japan has another name Nippon Germany has Deutschland. But these names are not known to people. Indian govt only has reach till india. Books, articles, documents, references towards India will not be changed just to satisfy our ego. Also Bombay doesn't have oceans,subcontinent, tectonic plates and natural phenomenon named after it. You are also ignoring the cost of changing the name. Which will be deducted from tax money. There is NO gain for citizens but only for BJP. The fact that Pakistan (or their media) says that they could claim the name India alone makes it completely certain that no name change will happen lol One owner: Adani Ftfy The problem is that the news was first picked up by Times Now which is basically a government run organization. That's using Devnagari Script, the language is still English. It would be another thing if they wrote, \"इंडियन तेल\" Look up all the \"internal matter\" twats. If any celebrity is doing it, it'll be them. I'm being they have got the new orders. Adani. Manipur. G20 hemorrhaging leaders like a bout of cholera. Inflation. Joblessness. So many things to cover up. Amitabh Bachchan, Virender Sehwag What if they want you to speculate? What if they want people to get into the habit of being distracted from actual issues by these stunts? All this work in white washing instead of actual reforms... Might end up being another way for bhakts to distinguish themselves from sane citizens. And then the question asked will be why are people protesting before anything official was announced? Protestors are anti-nationals! Bulldozer time! All I am saying is wait a little longer for something more definitive. This is like a game of three card monte. Even if something will happen, we need to wait for official word not speculation by godi media. A short edit, name is not being changed to Bharat.. India has two names already.. they want to erase the name India. He is right. This post is just to get people not to panic over media speculation. I wonder where that money would actually go in such a scenario. Yes. Something is always brewing with these electionjeevis But best to save our energy till we know what exactly they're upto. Isn't some scheme always up their sleeve? I am sure they are upto something and nothing good. But this Pavlovian tendency to get worried when it's just speculation can not be good for the nation's collective mental health. That just plays into their hands. Maybe. Time will tell Andhbhakts will now start calling themselves bhartiya making it easier to identify them lol They should change Adani's name to Bhadani. It will match. There is no worry as it's not a new name. Worry is for chutiyapa happening every other day. Modis operandi - make a solution find problems later > Someone just doesn't do it randomly, twice. its a feature not a bug raga has foresight hence named his yatra as bharat jodo not india jodo :P ye sab media waale ke liye ek aparachit movie wala character chahye.. Yet no one noticed the lotus under the globe on all communique? So… like Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited? They don't have conviction or plan to do anything. They just heard INDIA alliance and to undermine the name and distract the opposition and masses from real issues. Its really brilliant tbh. Gov : Prints President of Bharat Media : Gov changing India to Bharat Me : Which thing are they trying to distract us from? No, I am specifically talking about your sentence that “foreigners will never acknowledge it”. There are examples of this being done before - eg. Persia -> Iran. Ceylon -> Colombo. Burma -> Myanmar. Rhodesia -> Zimbabwe All have eventually caught on. Turkey -> Türkiye is too new (Just like Bangalore to Bengaluru or Allahabad to Prayagraj is). Not enough time has passed cite either of these examples of “failed” name changes. If you are bringing the cost angle then it’s a different issue. Unless though you want to make wholesale changes from day 1 (which would not make sense) there would not be costs involved. For example we do not need to rename institutions having the India in it. Nor do we need to do anything like a currency call back etc - the existing currency can be kept and just the new currency being printed can have the name change etc. the names of existing institutions can be kept and the names of new institutions can incorporate the word Bharat. Eventually (after a few years) existing institutional names may be changed as well. Existing campaigns such as Make in India etc can be continued. New campaigns can include the name Bharat etc (which, I will point out already happened in the past eg: Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan, BharatNet etc) The difference with Germany and Japan here is that all the institutions within Germany and Japan use their official names “Deutschland” or “Nippon”. The names Germany and Japan mostly appear only in English language and some other European languages (and not consistently, Germany is called Alemania in Spanish). English is not the official language or either Germany or Japan so it doesn’t really matter what it is called in English to either. Absolutely, no one needs to panic over it. It simply feeds into the fear narrative. I only partly agree with Vir Das. There are many Indias. Always has been. Unity in diversity. BJPs is only there to troll ppl Yes I'm sorry but who actually gives a flying fuck about this? Genuinely save your outrage for Manipur, Kashmir, communal and casteist atrocities, and other things that actually matter. Bhārat ke Rastrapati (Bhartiya Rastrapati is Indian President) President of Bharat shows stupidity in understanding that importance of brand India or incompetence in Hindi. It's not brilliant. People are just that gullible. I did. 100% agreement. East India company.. oh wait. The British never invaded Bharat. What is adanis full name ? I hope its not Bharat Adani ?? Lol > written in Roman Script it should be Bhārat why not Bhārata? If it is Bharatham, I am fine...why we need to rename everything to Hindi names... The government dangled a bait and the opposition fell for it. Hook, Line and Sinker. Ram Mandir and abolition of 370 was on BJP agenda ever since it was formed. It was no mere jumla. They implemented these two the moment they got a chance. But this name change is way bigger than 370 or Ram Mandir. Its all to distract the public from the recent Adani papers. It was to distract everyone from G20 'where Putin and Xi are not coming' news. Putin is not coming because he'll have to face western countries and Xi because he hates India and America. Anyway it's setback for India because it couldn't gather all the leaders from different economies and in its presidency the tagline is 'Vasudhaiva kutumbakam' which literally translates 'the whole world is one family'. Govt is rattled by the opposition's name? Is this wishful thinking or is it really something that is legit gaining traction? That could be one reason. This govt has a lot of things they don't want the public to notice including the things they haven't done. The thing about this BJP is that they are willing to fight for the smallest of things. Plus they have hoardes of stans willing to fight for them for free. Modi associating IM with INDIA block the day after the naming shows how thin his skin is. Plus his way of introducing changes is consistent. My view is that he is testing the boundaries with this move and the intention to change the name immediately wasnt really there. This is a thinly veiled attack on INDIA coalition being formed. They’re hoping to create another divide with Bharat Vs India. Just trying to understand perspectives here - what’s the harm in calling our country Bharat? Isn’t that what we were called until the the British decided to permanently call our country India? And the amount of streets, building, cities and institutions who's names have already been changed makes this speculation within the realm of possibility. Yes. Exactly. Plus, idk but I really dislike when people are told they're stupid when really they're manipulated by yellow journalism and then gaslighted by opposung views of people. It's media who's controlled, it's the WhatsApp groups and forwards that are controlled, the story that is woven and disinformation campaign run. And mind you, now it's not just run by Bhakts, it's run by all, whatever piece of narrative they can grab, like chess board. As I raised earlier in another sub, the opposition couldn't/didn't oppose vital issues tabled like Independence of Election commission, who's responsible for it? The common man or people in power who are there to oppose even if govt form nahi ho Rahi? Name one actual issue. Nobody knows what an actual issue is. Apparently, the only important issue our country is facing is that it's not a Hindu Rashtr often they put things out, and then see when the time is ripe. One nation -one election, Hindi for all etc etc. and also, their shit doesnt need to be a single motive thing, they will use a single thing to achieve multiple goals. Give people something to debate about. Make them take sides. Gauge public mood. Let the public forget ethnic cleansing in Manipur. Let them rile up for \"Indigenous pride\" before elections. Let them stop asking questions about Adani in news. If the majority public are ok with it implement the shitty thing. If majority is opposing keep them on backburner for sometime while propoganda spreads about the benifits of shit. If only they put half the effort in actually framing policies after thinking through all sides and considering all stake holders instead of being a inferiority complex ridden dick length measurers shitting all over. *GPS chips* 🤦 just directly change it to Chaddistan. No need for cronology This is all a reaction to the opposition naming their alliance as India Now the opposition needs to change their alliance name to bharat Why not change it to Maha Opposition for Democratic India? Unfortunately the white washing works better than reforms for them. That speaks to the quality of their voters. What if it's testing the waters? It's better to show the voice loud and clear and politicians will change colors. Ofcourse gov is the master in distraction, how is it possible that these people are allowed in power who think they can do what they want? India is our identity and they want to take that away as well. listen to the ridiculous debates on it. Protesting something because of media speculation will lead to burn out. You have to choose your battles. Also this is hardly the biggest issue the government has to address. Even if they ''backpedal'' on an issue they didn't even raise, it will just give citizens an illusion of victory. There has been no official govt word about making Bharat the preferred name for the country. All we have now is two instances where the word Bharat was used. Bharat is not a new term. It is in the constitution as another name for India. All this noise is from media speculation and people taking the bait. There are more important things to worry about. India has been the name of our region for long before that. The West Indians are called that because Columbus thought he found India. And before the British came, India was a not really a unified nation which different principalities and languages. The first time it was unified, it was under the name India. That is our national identity. People around the world see that as India. We are known as Indians. Our sports players play for team India. When isro landed the lander on the moon, we and everyone else talked about how it was a huge step for India. To rename the country would be to start an identity from scratch. That’s unappealing to me. Maha Opposition against Democratic India\\* You are speculating that they want you to speculate Speculcemption! No, anyone who uses India will be termed anti-national in the arguments. The logic of the argument will go to gutter and \"how dare you say india\", will be the 'siachin jawan' This kuch bhi naam change krlo rahega toh adani ka india hi It's speculation all the way down! >My guess is that they will be using Bharat for all the positive news and India for all negative news. Like this? [https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/rapes-happen-in-india-not-bharat-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-blames-western-culture-for-gangrapes-150752-2013-01-03](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/rapes-happen-in-india-not-bharat-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-blames-western-culture-for-gangrapes-150752-2013-01-03) Spared no expense Damn dude, I just took the guess as a shot it the dark, turns out the chaddis are more degenerate than I estimated. Seems it is all just rumours. Either way, it is always too late to protest. BJP is not the only ones. Remember how CCongress black out the Parliament TV during bifurcation of Andhra? Exactly, buddha has history to scare the shit out of people. No name change was planned. But was this a planted story and subsequent outcome, you bet. Who types official invites we PRESIDENT OR BHARAT OR PRIME MINISTER OF BHARAT. Fkn Morons. Exactly this. Government of headline management. Every week there is a new circus. Its been 9 years. Bharat jodo yatra part 2 when? I don't remember the dates but I think it starts somewhere in December-January? Yup. The India <> Bharat thing is not new. Chaddis have been pushing this since the 2000s. Will it? No News yet. Its a non-issue, this is clearly another news story to distract from a more important news (you guys know what i am talking about). It doesn't even make any sense how will you rename a country bharat when its already called bharat in the constitution? &#x200B; and if the pakistanis end up claiming the name after we give it up it will lead to national embarrassment. (this has been a long going debate there, listen to any of their podcasts they always complain about how the name India doesn't make sense for us since a majority of Indus valley sites are in Pak) not to mention the cost of rebranding and the rest of the world will only catch on like 10 years later. white people will start calling us \"bhartians\"?? LOL we will have to correct them \"no no its bhartiya\". Even if they are serious about this I hope it never happens. To me all our names be it India, Bharat or Hindustan are extremely dear, i cherish all of them and I would not be happy if anyone tries to take it away from me. &#x200B; I do agree with you that the government doesn't have any strong intentions to change the name but they are testing the waters for sure and if it ends up happening it will also be a pre-cursor to changing the constitution completely Well, tbf, this speculation is not without merit or cause. They have been slowly & steadily replacing India with Bharat. Case in point, among other things, the new IPC, CrPc, Evidence Act, replacement also use Bharat not India. Anti Hindi.. for not using Hindi /s Why call the special session without announcing anything? Beloved pm didn’t have time to go to Manipur or discuss anything on it and now wants to waste people’s time on speculation. Nautanki! go cry someplace else Good points, noted. 👌🏼"
