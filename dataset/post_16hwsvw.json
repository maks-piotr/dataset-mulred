        "i dont want this number to be high anyways, we should have a high service sector contribution instead of working in factories",
        "You cannot make farmers into software engineers first comes the factories",
        "And why do you exactly saw that? Service sector contribution is about skilled intellectuals. Where does rest of India go? Only 60 percent of Indians are educated beyond 8th standard, you can't expect them to sit in a plush office in Bangalore or Gurgaon and code (just an example )\n\nAlso why would you want to look at absolute numbers? If you want to look at absolute numbers let's look at growth in GDP in terms of absolutes too (US vs India or China vs India) \n\nI'm surprised that we are even thinking of looking at absolute numbers when GDP growth is calculated in CAGr",
        "Lol this the definition of statistics being used to for propaganda except this is a hilarious fail attempt ðŸ¤£ \nPre 1990 India's GDP was literally peanuts this graph shows how well other sectors have manganese to push indian economy up",
        "Okay so how about 2002 onwards?",
        "Why u want to make every thing in india and screw it with pollution like China did",
        "Service sector is 100x bigger than just software engineering and that too sitting in a plush office. Restaurants hotels etc also come under service sector. Service sector is better than manufacturing because you produce more output (more GDP) per hour as compared to manufacturing sector.  Given this last statement, would you like manufacturing sector contribution to go up or down? And I said to look at absolute numbers because make in India doesnâ€™t mean that % of manufacturing will go up, itâ€™s just means MORE would be manufactured",
        "Yeah I don't want to,  but what is about all the noise about? \n\nI'd ideally want skilled intellectual labour for my country, but that's unfortunately not going to happen since 60 percent of Indians don't have education beyond primary (8th standard) in absence of that, the economy is going to be pushed by farming and manufacturing.",
        "Do you even know the meaning of service sector",
        "And the skilled ones are leaving the country for better life",
        "Yeah, not a good growth story there also :p\n\n2019 was an anomaly because all other form on value adds stopped due to covid and our GDP shrunk. , look at where UPA started in 2004 and where it reached.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cw1vla2j03ob1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ebb12e9792e05ed05aaf407da6dffc2ad373c59",

        "Not denying what you are saying, just that your previous argument was incorrect.",
        "Then my question is, are we just growing because our work force is growing or there is any value add done my the government?",
        "Ok so did the service sector grow?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnp4zqdc13ob1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bba822f56830e1474feddf73da460fa05e503fb\n\nUPA clearly did much better here too",
        "Gdp growth comes from population growth (which. Is 1%ish) and productivity growth , given our gdp growth rate is higher than 1% we do have some productivity growth because people are doing better jobs. I wonâ€™t go into which government did better as I can take either sides by choosing the correct charts to show.",
        "Not at all talking about population growth, talking about workforce growth.",
        "Lol ok, but you do know a rickshaw driver also comes in service sector right, or you just want to say random statements confidently because you have no arguments",
        "Yeah I meant that only, working population",

So far it hasnâ€™t worked but that doesnâ€™t mean the idea is bad, itâ€™s just the execution thatâ€™s terrible because our politicians are idiots.\n\nManufacturing canâ€™t succeed in a corrupt, policy unstable(taxes and policies change on whim), infrastructure lacking country with lots of red tape. These are systemic problems which will require at least a decade more to solve, if ever.",
        "It peaked at 50%, and has dipped since 2020",
        "Bro in all honesty, you are reading this graph wrong.  % of GDP being lower means there are others contributing even more and that still doesnâ€™t mean manufacturing is going down.",
        "Sure, but the numbers are bloated by considering Gig work in service jobs",

        "Were do you see a growth after 2014??????\n\n2019 was a growth only because we stopped all forms of revenue except services. Also our GDP shrunk the most in this world",

service sector x bigger software engineering sitting plush office restaurants hotels etc also come service sector service sector better manufacturing produce output gdp per hour compared manufacturing sector given last statement would like manufacturing sector contribution go said look absolute numbers make india doesnt mean manufacturing go means would manufactured yeah dont want noise id ideally want skilled intellectual labour country thats unfortunately going happen since percent indians dont education beyond primary th standard absence economy going pushed farming manufacturing even know meaning service sector skilled ones leaving country better life yeah good growth story also p anomaly form value adds stopped due covid gdp shrunk look upa started reached must taught economic history backwards say shit confidently indias gdp lets first denying saying previous argument incorrect question growing work force growing value add done government ok service sector grow upa clearly much better gdp growth comes population growth ish productivity growth given gdp growth rate higher productivity growth people better jobs wont go government better take either sides choosing correct
