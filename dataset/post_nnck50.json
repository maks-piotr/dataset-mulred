        "Mare Of Eastown. Mystery + Drama miniseries by HBO. Kate Winslet plays a police officer trying to solve a murder while battling with her personal trauma. Super thrilling and engaging right from the first episode. Everyone acts superbly well. Finale (7th episode) airs this Sunday.",
        "None of the new stuff intrigues me anymore, been around 8 months since I watched an Indian film.\n\nCheck out Lex Fridman's podcasts.",
        "November story is a decent watch however they could have done a better job with dubbing.",
        "Cukur and Who killed captain alex",
        "Animal Farm \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXkicQRl6vg",
        "The Imposter",
        "Trapped on Netflix is good",
        "I watched the documentary [The Balkans in Flames](https://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Balkans_in_Flames) about Yugoslavia's disintegration into Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzgovina, Serbia, Albania after Tito's death in 1980. I didn't have much knowledge of this except for whatever I saw in the hollywood movie *The Peacemakers,* starring George Clooney.",
        "If I get the time, I'm thinking of watching Family Man S1 on prime the one starring Manoj Bajpai",
        "Might watch \"Operation Java\"",
        "Caliphate. Fast paced no BS Swedish series.",
        "‚ÄúBecoming You‚Äù  on Apple TV was a great watch",
        "Please suggest some Sci-fi shows/movies with MAJOR focus on getting the scientific accuracy right. I'm not talking about movies like Armageddon, but like Gravity, or Interstellar, Expanse, Martian.. the like.",
        "[Primer](https://letterboxd.com/film/primer/) directed by Shane Carruth, [Predestination](https://letterboxd.com/film/predestination/), [Ex Machina](https://letterboxd.com/film/ex-machina-2014/), [Arrival](https://letterboxd.com/film/arrival-2016/), [Annihilation](https://letterboxd.com/film/annihilation/)",
        "Might watch 'Radhe' and actively try not to lose the few brain cells I have left.",
        "Check out the SNL sketch called ‚ÄòMurder Durder‚Äô after. Hilarious take on MoE",
        "Apple TV+ has some really good shows. So far i have watched - Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, For All Mankind, Defending Jacob and Servant and they all have been really really good (especially Ted Lasso, For All Mankind and The Morning Show)",
        "For All Mankind",
        "Trying to watch *the wire*. About six episodes in. Don't see how this is better than *breaking bad*. Maybe I should give it a few more episodes.",
        "Check out 'The Expanse' on Amazon Prime",
        "ZeroZeroZero is a top notch crime drama",
        "The Wire starts slow. But has the most brilliant and realistic representation of American drug trade/police/politics. It is not a show about high octane thriller like Breaking Bad. I find it to be much more engaging than BB tbh.",
        "Watch annihilation and ex-machina.",
        "It's my favorite show of all time but it's not entertaining in the conventional sense (atleast early on). You really have to give it your complete attention. There's so much symbolism portrayed through scenes or dialogues which otherwise might not seem that important. A good example is the scene where the guys are pushing the desk stuck across the doorway, but unknowingly doing so in opposite directions - it's essentially a commentary on the war of drugs. You need to notice stuff like this to fully appreciate The Wire. I have rewatched it 3 times now and every single time I notice something new. \n\nIf you wanna watch something more along the lines of Breaking Bad, watch The Sopranos. It's just as symbolically richly as The Wire, but more conventionally entertaining.",
        "Planning to watch 'The Disciple' today.",
        "This was good. Thanks!",
        "I love slow cinema (tarkovsky, Tsai ming liang). But the disciple is just a slow movie with minimal poetry. Still miles ahead for indian standards.",

        "I mostly get obsessed over Physics and logic in general.\n\nThe Expanse is &lt;3.

        "I agree with the rest of your comment but Battlestar Galactica is absolutely NOT scientifically accurate at all. I think I watched till season 2(I _will_ get back to it someday), and don't get me wrong, I do love the show and the characters are very interesting, but you can clearly see that getting the Science right was not a priority for them. \n\nAgree with Expanse though. I've read all the books and watched the show at least 3 times. Haven't found a sci-fi that comes close to that, yet.",
        "Hahaha. üòÇüòÇ",
        "Hang in there it gets better. But don't go ahead expecting that it's better than Anny other show.\n\nIt's really really good show, watch it first and then make comparisons. It's not like if it's not better than breaking bad it's not worth watching.\n\nI personally try not to go into watching media with expectations,  because whenever I have done that it has ruined the watching experience.",
