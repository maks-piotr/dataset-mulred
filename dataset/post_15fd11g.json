    "selftext": "Link: https://youtu.be/4W5oHHsosX0\n\nI recently came across this videos and I realised that as a single child, just of 22 years even I’ve had instances where I’ve said almost the same things as the guy in the video. I’ve also been in the same shoes and honestly it sucks but this video gave me an insight that it’s much more common that we think. A lot of people are suffering in the early adult and we need to build communities free of cost based on common interests to help people socialise and make friends.",

I believe friends are overrated, especially by movies and melodramatic TV shows. I find happiness and contentment in living alone and doing things I love. By transforming loneliness into aloneness, I can enjoy my own company and indulge in activities that bring me joy. I have the freedom to go to places I've always wanted to visit, eat what I like, watch movies at my convenience, and engage in various activities like working out, riding, and driving.\n\nThere is so much thing in the world you an do alone.

Started working out like there was no tomorrow. There were days I didn't stop until my muscles just failed. I started feeling better mentally (I don't know how working out helped but it did).\n\nLater on I came out of the \"introvert\" mentality and started saying yes to every plan that came my way. These weren't plans that came out of nowhere. I had rekindled a lot of old and lost friendships.
