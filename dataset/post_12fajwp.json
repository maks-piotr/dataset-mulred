    "selftext": "Did you know that many corporate hospitals such as Apollo, Manipal, Max, Narayana Hrudayalaya, and several others have been hiring Ayurveda and Homeopathic doctors as resident or duty doctors? They employ these doctors to work as emergency or casualty medical officers, resident medical officers, and even to manage ICUs at night. These quacks then go on to prescribe modern medicine without any knowledge about it whatsoever (they don't prescribe Ayurveda or Homeopathic medications here). The primary reason for this is to increase profits, as hiring a BAMS graduate (Ayurveda Doctor) is much more profitable than hiring an MBBS graduate doctor. The salary for an Ayurveda Doctor is around 20-30k (sometimes even lower), whereas an MBBS graduate doctor would need to be paid over 60k.\n\nThe issue is not only that they are hiring Ayurveda doctors but that these corporate hospitals do not disclose this fact to the patients. Patients visiting a large hospital such as Apollo or Narayana may not suspect that their doctor is an Ayurveda/Homeopathy doctor, so they do not ask, and the corporate hospitals do not inform them unless they are asked.\n\nThese quacks then go on to prescribe medications without any training in modern medicine, including pharmacology, drug interactions, and contraindications. They simply prescribe medications based on memorized treatment protocols for specific complaints without knowledge of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drugs or differential diagnoses for the patient's complains.\n\nPatients visiting these corporate hospitals expect top-quality treatment from qualified doctors, as they are paying a significant amount of money in bills and fees. However, in reality, the line of treatment available in these corporate hospitals is subpar at best. I will make a post about the quality of the drugs at their pharmacy's some other time, just know that they are mostly cheap local brands with large margins of profits.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing can be done about this situation, as the government is pushing AYUSH and allowing quacks to prescribe modern medicine. There's even Ayurveda post graduate course now with PG Specialities like General Surgery, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology etc. They will also be hired by these corporate hospitals in the near future. \n\nThese corporate hospitals will continue to hire Ayurveda Doctors, and most people will not be aware of it. Corporate hospitals make a considerable amount of money, but they do not use it to hire qualified doctors, and the doctors they do hire are often overworked and underpaid (18 hours shifts, on call duty, understaffed departments etc)\n\nMany doctors are leaving the country for better work hours and pay due to this issue. In their greed, these corporate hospitals are filling our healthcare system with quacks and are ultimately going to destroy the system. I advise that the patients visiting corporate chain hospitals inquire about the credentials of the resident doctor who is treating them. You can ask them directly, and the hospital staff cannot lie to you. \n\nTBH, visiting medical colleges or small hospitals owned by real doctors is a far better option. These facilities often offer more affordable fees and better treatment options than corporate chain hospitals.\n\nHow do I know this? Because I am a Doctor working at a well known corporate hospital and am tired of having to deal with this bullshit everyday.\n\nYou don't have to take my word for it, [here's a Times of India article from 2020 on this issue - Many private hospitals using Ayush doctors in ICUs.](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/many-pvt-hospitals-using-ayush-doctors-in-icus/articleshow/78713160.cms)",

Notice how the owners hardly ever deal with patients directly. That distance is intentional and enables exploitation. If you just stop seeing ppl suffering, and sit in front of excel sheet whole day its becomes very easy to not care about ppl.\n\nYou have to pay attention to individuals in charge. Some still have values and principle. Find them and work for them. Dont work for money minded ppl. Its a trap. And they know how to trap good ppl. They will show off how much money they have to burn. They will show off how much time they have to waste on superficial things. All to signal you want to be like me, come work for me. Most ppl realize too late what trap they have fallen into.

Healthcare professionals are heavily screened and the barrier to entry is extremely high in most European countries,US and Australia.

But regulations for giving licence to doctors are extremely rigid they don't allow quacks or pseudoscience peddlers to come even close.\n\nEven doctors who make pseudoscientific claims get their licenses revoked ( Mehmet Oz of the dr oz show had his license cancelled a long time back because he used peddle BS health supplements)\n\nThat doesn't mean that a legit doctor won't make these claims after passing through accredited institutions, but the government ensures that accreditions are only given out institutions which are proper.",

        "This is totally true. Not just for doctors but even for nursing stuff. My mom is a stage 4 , carcinoma, MBS. I have to visit hospital every month. Sometimes we have to stay a night or two due to her poor health. I used to initially think that a nurse was new and may not be knowing the procedure well but to my awe and shock, most corporate hospital nurses cannot fit a cannula. If they do, it gets dislocated and drugs that are supposed to go in vein , go in the body and you will see a huge fluid build up swelling or graying… I even got frustrated by the nursing staff and changed hospitals from Rajiv Gandhi to max to fortis…and its the same story everywhere. Last week, I had a tough time as my mothers health condition deteriorated and I had to stay in hospital for over a week. Then I found out what is happening. Like most IT companies, these hospitals now do a mass recruitment of nurses from small towns and villages where the education level is not upto the mark. Not that the nurses aren’t hardworking, it’s just that they aren’t trained or experienced. So a nurse told me, we were not trained in our college. Then to support the family, we got this campus offer and we were recruited. Finally , when we reach here we are put in PGs. Sharing two to three beds and we pay a rent for staying there. The hospital also arranges a bus so that all can go together and are on time. We aren’t fed good food and our duty hours are long. On top of this if there is a casualty, shortage of staff due to personal reasons or just to support other nurse we cover shifts for each other..and this is all a very hectic experience. Most of these nurses are freshmen and they don’t know the system so they have to abide by the school culture enforced on them by the hospital. I asked her why do you even do such a job if it doesn’t pay you well and you are so understaffed and overworked . She told me the next level . The next level is Dubai and Australia.. once you complete 2 years of work ex , a good brand hospital issues an experience certificate. Naturally in these 2 years, we also learn and have a hands on experience and then we are shifted to Dubai via a agent and paid very nicely. This has been ongoing for years for the nurses from Kerala and once the system was known, the small institutes around UP, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand have all formed this close partnership with hospitals. \n\nIt doesn’t end here, there’s more stuff - a lot of times , a lot of medication is indented on a patients file but these are never administered or  are given a placebo. You then sell this medicines to other hospitals or pharmacy shops.. at half the price.\n\nFinally, I once became good friends with a doctor in a government hospital and asked her why do doctors in private hospitals ask us to keep repeating tests. She told me, they don’t want to do it out of their free will but it’s the corporate hospitals that force them to repeat the tests as they all must meet a certain target . It’s like sales. Every doctor must do certain number of sales or you loose your job and my next question was, you wouldn’t do it in your conscious right ? But she said - we are also like any ordinary middle class family and the whole thing starts with Aakash institute. They charge a hefty amount and take the whole year fee in max 2 installments. Then you have to pay some extra tuitions , foreign author books etc. finally no medical college accepts a child without a donation fee including the government hospitals and this is after you clear the exams or you have a top shot recommendation . So, you pile up with soo much loan that in order to give your loan you also fall in this vicious Circe.",

        "For a while now, it has been known that some corporate hospitals are hiring Ayurveda and Homeopathic doctors as resident or duty doctors, and even to manage ICUs at night. The main reason for this is cost-effectiveness. However, there is rising criticism about the qualifications of these doctors and the safety of patients. It is a concern that patients may not be aware that their doctor lacks training in modern medicine, which can be risky when prescribing medications without knowledge of drug interactions and contraindications. On top of that, corporate hospitals do not always disclose that they employ Ayurveda and Homeopathic doctors, which can lead to confusion and risk for patients.\n\nThough the question arises, who will check a doctor's credentials, especially in emergency situations? When the hell is breaking loose.\n\nStill on case to case basis, patients or their relatives can protect themselves by inquiring about the credentials of the resident doctor if they suspect something is amiss. It's also a good idea to spread the word about the hospital in the city in general. \n\nVsiting medical colleges or small hospitals owned by qualified and famous doctors who practice modern medicine exclusively may be a safer option if for patients if time permits. \n\nGovernment recognizes Ayurveda and Homeopathy as valid medical practices, patients must ensure they receive proper medical care by qualified professionals. After all, you only have one life, so it's not worth risking it. I also think ayurveda is good, but as a preventative measure, not in critical cases or if something exclusively requiring allopathic medicine. And homeopathy.... Well.",

        "Ayurveda at best can be described as a proto-science. They had some great ideas for their time. Undoubtedly the originators of Ayurveda were geniuses . But whatever ideas they had are primitive by today's standards. \"Science and Society in Ancient India\" by Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya is an excellent book to understand the ideas of medicinal science in Ayurveda in a more secular perspective. Bottom line, we are not made of the pancha bhoothas or diseases are not created by the imbalance in raktha, pitha and kabha. We know we are made of atoms and molecules, our body is one large chemical reaction and primarily we are made of cells. Diseases are far more complex originating from a variety of reasons from internal mechanism failure to external factors like bacteria and viruses.\n\nPromoting Ayurveda is equivalent to promoting the methods of Hippocrates by people in Europe because he was some ancient ancestor. Unfortunately unlike in the west Ayrveda or any proto-scientific material in India is deeply entangled with religion and therefore instead of advancing they got frozen in the past eventually becoming superstitious nonsense preserved and practiced simply because of religious faith and credulity of the general public.\n\nOn a tangential note, the history of science is rather interesting. The Greeks, Indians, Muslims(mostly Iraq, Iran, Afganisthan) and later modern Europeans  were masters at different points in human history, preserving and advancing it to what we know today.",

She had a infected cyst on her neck, a common indicator of TB.  The neighbourhood GP suggested Lotus Hospital, Vashi for removal of said cyst before beginning TB treatment. The doctors in the hospital started her on RKT, a common treatment regimen. But my mom reacted very violently to it - she had severe diarrhoea and vomiting. So much so that she became catatonic. The medicine was stopped. But the doctors insisted there was no alternative. After one more try with the same results, they directed us to their “senior”. He said the same fucking thing. Incidentally, I happen to see the certificate framed on the GP’s wall and found it to be on BAMS. I didn’t know then what it meant and had to Google.  That’s when I consulted a pulmonologist in Coimbatore. He immediately put my mind to rest. He suggested an alternative but with a longer duration. Just speaking with him was a different experience. His medication eventually cured her without any side effects. \n\nThis is my most personal experience with BAMS but there are others where they misdiagnosed diseases causing at the least panic and at the most death.",

        "This is just a demand-supply issue. India creates very few MBBS doctors per year so someone has to pick up the slack. Your high salaries are only justified by the fact that there are fewer of you in number.\n\nIt's not like we have a situation where a large number of doctors in India are competing among themselves to serve in rural areas or in night shifts. Most refuse to serve outside the comfort of cities and the rest pack up their bags and leave the country asap after they graduate.\n\nThe medical community in India has created stupid rules which prevent opening of a larger number of medical colleges because the scarcity of mbbs doctors suits them as it drives up their collective average income and then they have the audacity to claim that only the 90,000 odd doctors India gets annually are the only people brilliant enough in the country to get into this profession. Fuck off.\n\nMedicine in India is just another example of artificial scarcity created to prop up the small minority of people who get to enter this field. It's just like Chartered Accountancy. There's no reason for there being so few Chartered Accountants in a country like India but that's how they have designed the system.\n\nYour problem with homeo and ayurveda is not because you think that they actively harm people. You already do that by making medical services unavailable for the vast majority of this country's population. Your problem is that they are filling in some critical vacancies which is making your value do down. Cry me a river.\n\nEdit: Yes i know that alternate system medics are not the best option for filing the positions they have been filling. That was never my point. However, my point of artificial scarcity still stands. Why are there so few medical schools in India and so many engineering colleges? What's preventing all these politicians from opening medical schools when it's such a profitable business?",

Again, I asked this to OP and he just ignored it - do you actually know the curriculum taught in BAMS? What skill sets are required for ICU management? Please note, we are talking about ICU care, we are not talking about disease diagnostics or deciding which medicine to prescribe to the patient. Have you spent any time in assessing whether the BAMS curriculum provides the homeopathy doctors with enough knowledge about human physiology required for ICU care? Do you know that BAMS doctors have to do an additional training course before they are put in charge of ICU care? Do you know what is taught in that course?  \n\n\nHow are you just passing all these judgements about \"incompetence\" and \"zero knowledge\" without really analyzing all these factors?",

        "I do agree with what OP said and it is true, but i just don't understand the hate against BAMS doctors, and reading all the comments in here just really shows how blnidsided people are when it comes to ayurvedic medicine. As someone who has both MBBS and BAMS doctors in his family i am the perfect person to share my experience.  \n\n\nTo start this, BAMS doctors are not \"quacks\", but if you place them in a hospitable which deals with modern medicine ofc they are clueless. It isn't as bad as the general population thinks, in some places its worse but in most its not that bad. The hospital only benefits if the prescription being sold are of a certain value, this necessarily does not mean that the given prescription is \"needed\", in some/~~most~~ cases a low powered drug will also do the job. Then again the entire point of massive hospitals is to make money because it also is a form of businesses. THIS is the reason why a lot of people prefer government hospitals, or government aided hospitals.   \n\n\nOne of the best example which I have from the recent time is this, there's a certain medical owner in my city and the owner had a nerve damage or something along those lines, he was unable to move and it would hurt a shit-ton and he was basically left bed ridden. After visiting at least 5 hospitals (local and better), they were unsatisfied with the outcome of the discussion/ appointment. These 5 hospitals house some pretty well known doctors with vast experience under their belt. At the end they decided to go to the Bombay Hospital and were quiet impressed with the doctors, he had a surgery and the patient is absolutely amazing rn.  \n\n\nThe second example is of the same family where an elderly person had some xyz problem and hence they went to some pretty good doctors and the end result was a prescription of 8k for one month. Obviously after paying this amount, they thought the patient would feel good and let him go to his hometown but obviously it didn't work out. He was still in severe pain and was once again bought in Mumbai and they visited the bombay hospital again where he was prescribed a strip of rs.800 and he started feeling better after 2\\~3 days.  \n\n\nMoving onto the hate towards ayurveda and why its mostly towards people who have a degree in BAMS but practise modern medicine.\n\nMy family has BAMS doctors practising from 24 years, which is a considerable amount of time and their practise has been superb. Some of the many thing which I would like to mention here are, once again they are through experiences.  \n\n\nDuring covid, when it was august 2020 and covid was causing havoc my family was started showing all the symptoms of covid and it was obvious we had covid. Now at this position the best option was to go to a hospital but with the usage of steriods and a hazy line of treatment towards covid patients we decided against it, which is a pretty bold move in itself but apparently ayurveda deals with a shit-ton of viruses and covid could also be dealt with.   \nFor the next 2 weeks the medicines we were under really helped and eventually everyone stopped with the symptoms and well there's that. The medicines which we took were pretty  hard to remember but I do know a few which I took everyfuckingdayandnight, it included vasajivni with some water which apparently helped with blood (I personally have no idea), we also took guduchi boiled in water which tasted like absolute bubllshit, it was most bitter thing in the fucking world. Along with this, there were other powders being consumed with honey and it was such a routine to follow. But it worked and dare I say it worked better than laying in a hospital bed.  \n\n\nMy second experience with ayurveda is when I personally had to deal with the shittiest cough ever, I have a recovering cough which just shows up every year and it sucks because it just WONT LEAVE. It was so fucking bad, the bottles of the cough syrups just sitting on that shelf is still a sight to witness. From modern drugs to some weird tasting ayurvedic cough syrups nothing worked. Absolutely nothing would completely stop my cough.  \nWhich is when I was told about this thing called a \"vaman\", it basically meant I had to vomit my cough. and I was absolutely against it. Who in their right mind would fucking do that, even tho I ended up doing it I would never do it again unless absolutely necessary because man. i was given powders to eat and some other stuff before starting the \"ritual\".  \nThe procedure was pretty simple, I was starved for a day and then light food was given the night before and I woke up feeling hungry asf and also tired, and the afternoon came by and I had to to eat rice with milk and it was a bit weird but to vomit you really need to overeat, and I had to do it on purpose. So I ate as much as I could, to the point where I wanted to throw up and then I was given two full glasses of salt water with some powder mixed in it and THAT was it. I threw up so hard, istg I saw all the rice and then I could see the cough and I kept throwing up to the point where my stomach hurt and I was to stop when I felt something bitter in my mouth and yes it was extremely bitter and I was absolutely drained. but I haven't had cough since then and it's the best feeling to not deal with shitty cough,",

I asked around and some friends and seniors said that in their experience, centres will hire 1 MBBS doctor to do all the prescribing and other paper work and will hire BAMS/BHMS doctors because they can pay them a third of the MBBS doctor. \n\nTheir whole aim is to cut costs even if there’s only 1 qualified doctor putting in the meds and signing off notes for many floors. In practice, it’s not possible for one person to go on every round and see every patient across multiple wards while also writing notes, putting in orders, checking their own assigned patients, attending rounds for those patients and also double checking notes and orders for their colleagues before signing off, so they have to go by what the BAMS/BHMS note down from their rounds which at times can be very wrong. \n\nI had a friend in a situation like this in a prominent cardiac ward who was given grossly incorrect med orders and very obviously picked up on it. Unfortunately every time he’d have to call up the consultant to confirm these things because it’d be a he said-they said issue and every time he’d end up being yelled at for not being on the round (which isn’t humanly possible to be in multiple rounds at the same time).

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that on average, there is one doctor for every 1000 individuals worldwide, although this ratio may vary substantially across regions and nations. The so called “high salary” earned by physicians is due to the extensive and costly education and training required to become a doctor, which necessitates substantial talent and commitment. It is important to note, however, that corporate hospitals do not typically offer high salaries to physicians; an MBBS graduate can anticipate earning roughly 60,000 rupees, while a super specialist such as a cardiologist might earn roughly 1.5 lakh rupees. The exorbitant fees charged by corporate hospitals are frequently directed to the management's coffers\n\n>It's not like we have a situation where a large number of doctors in India are competing among themselves to serve in rural areas or in night shifts. Most refuse to serve outside the comfort of cities and the rest pack up their bags and leave the country asap after they graduate.\n\nUpon completing their MBBS degree, students are required to complete a minimum of one year of mandatory rural service, with the duration of the service varying depending on the state. However, the lack of adequate infrastructure in rural hospitals has become a significant issue. Surgeons and cardiologists, for example, are unable to offer their services in such environments without appropriate equipment and support. Even primary health centers (PHCs) may lack basic medical supplies like suture materials for emergency situations. Therefore, the government must be held accountable for failing to improve the infrastructure of rural hospitals, making it difficult for physicians to provide the necessary care to patients.\n\nYou know what, you’re free to get treatment from these quacks.

        "I will give my 2 cents to this issue :\nI have finished MBBS and am about to finish my DNB in Medicine.\n\nThe reason why private hospitals have these issues - our govt considers Ayurveda and homeopathy to be on par with MBBS. I struggled to get into MBBS and to pass. Foreign modern medicine graduates have to go through an excruciating exam to be eligible to practice in India.\n\nMeanwhile, becoming an ayurved or homeopath is ridiculously easy. And there are lots of these seats. The govt keeps pushing these branches up\n\nThese corporate hospitals take advantage of this confusion - MBBS graduates get 50-60k at the start while AYUSH people get 20-30k. The hospitals admit patients under an MBBS + MD/DNB specialist consultant, but many of these consultants have spent 10+ years becoming a consultant and have been working for longer as a consultant. They are not interested in working overnight.\n\nAs long as the patient is admitted under a proper consultant and a consultant takes rounds everyday, it is not illegal on the part of the hospital to keep Ayush \"doctors\" on call to do the boring work of writing drug orders, talking to relatives, making daily notes, checking pulse and BP etc.\n\nMost of these \"doctors\" will not do anything without calling up the consultant (even in the middle of the night) and asking for their advice. In very reputed hospitals, ayush people will not be in the ICU. They will do clerical work in the stable wards only. I am in a hospital that doesnt take AYUSH doctors by policy, but that does mean the hospital has to pay twice the amount to the Mbbs doctors they hire. Not many hospitals would be willing to do that.\n\nThe solution is for the health ministry to make it clear that only MBBS doctors should be allowed to write drug orders prescribing modern medicine. AYUSH must not be allowed the privilege to prescribe modern antibiotics, sedating agents, steroids etc. But our govt will never do this. Pseudoscience is big in our govt\n\nI remember a patient had been transferred to us from some small hospital. He had mild covid and only needed home isolation for 5 days, instead a homeopath prescribed him high dose steroids thrice daily for 2 weeks. Poor guy ended up with mucormycosis at our hospital, had to have half his lung removed and barely survived.",

Instead of being someone who practices modern medicine or has a doctorate in a scientific field, now the word is hijacked by those who want a chill life but make money and respect\n\n.",

        ">MBBS graduate would need to be paid more than 60k\n\nThis is blatantly false. Very very few hospitals pay more than 30-40k for an MBBS graduate duty or ICU doctor.\n\nI’m an MBBS graduate and the maximum salary I was being offered anywhere was 30-35k **in a Metro city in India**. It might be even lower in tier 2 cities and smaller cities. I live in a state where the state government pays great stipends for internship and PG students- yet corporate hospitals are offering around 30k only for an MBBS graduate. I also did my MBBS from the best government medical college in the state. \n\nYou need a  post-graduate  degree to make more money than that. \n\nThe only reason why MBBS doctors don’t complain about this is that PG degrees are a must now, so the only people seeking out jobs on an MBBS degree are young doctors who didn’t get a PG seat right away, or those who just want a break before studying for PG entrances and want to occupy their time by gaining \n some experience or those doctors who finish MBBS and aim for residency/PG positions in other countries and need some work experience on their CV, or are preparing for exams and just want a job since it’s boring to study all day. \n\nI don’t know which city you live in, or which hospital is giving MBBS doctors 60k, but that is definitely not the norm in most of this country. A very prominent and famous corporate hospital I worked at gives only 30k to MBBS duty doctors and they have such a huge number of applications that they’re not even remotely requiring to rely on AYUSH graduates.\n\nThe number of MBBS seats in this country right now is a little over 1 lakh and PG seats are just over 45000.

        "Sorry mate. I am no longer in touch with the friend I have mentioned. I do hope you receive the help you need and all the best.",
        "That nurse point is so accurate. When I was admitted, the nurse inserted cannula at a wrong angle which resulted in massive swelling and extreme pain. Finnally, after institing several times, they removed the cannula and put another one into the other arm.",

        "If people like sushruta or charaka were alive today, they would've used scientific data to keep updating the ayurvedic system to a scientifically accurate one. This would go on to the point where ayurveda and modern medicine would be the same.",
        "Damn I am a bams doctor and hearing us called as quack is overwhelming. Ayurveda is really misunderstood by people.",
        "Passed away, around 4 years back.",
        "Oh my god, thank you for this information! I’ve been really confused to see why all these BAMS doctors are working in a normal hospital with no drug knowledge as per their education. Surprisingly these are the doctors that try so hard on internet to post about their day and prove that they are also so called DOCTORS! But this is insane. Be safe guys always check if the doctor is qualified (MBBS, MD) and not BAMS."

    "light_cleaned_title": "Did you know that most corporate hospitals have been hiring Ayurveda and Homeopathic doctors as resident or duty doctors or even to manage ICUs at night",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Did you know that many corporate hospitals such as Apollo, Manipal, Max, Narayana Hrudayalaya, and several others have been hiring Ayurveda and Homeopathic doctors as resident or duty doctors? They employ these doctors to work as emergency or casualty medical officers, resident medical officers, and even to manage ICUs at night. These quacks then go on to prescribe modern medicine without any knowledge about it whatsoever (they don't prescribe Ayurveda or Homeopathic medications here). The primary reason for this is to increase profits, as hiring a BAMS graduate (Ayurveda Doctor) is much more profitable than hiring an MBBS graduate doctor. The salary for an Ayurveda Doctor is around 20-30k (sometimes even lower), whereas an MBBS graduate doctor would need to be paid over 60k. The issue is not only that they are hiring Ayurveda doctors but that these corporate hospitals do not disclose this fact to the patients. Patients visiting a large hospital such as Apollo or Narayana may not suspect that their doctor is an Ayurveda/Homeopathy doctor, so they do not ask, and the corporate hospitals do not inform them unless they are asked. These quacks then go on to prescribe medications without any training in modern medicine, including pharmacology, drug interactions, and contraindications. They simply prescribe medications based on memorized treatment protocols for specific complaints without knowledge of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drugs or differential diagnoses for the patient's complains. Patients visiting these corporate hospitals expect top-quality treatment from qualified doctors, as they are paying a significant amount of money in bills and fees. However, in reality, the line of treatment available in these corporate hospitals is subpar at best. I will make a post about the quality of the drugs at their pharmacy's some other time, just know that they are mostly cheap local brands with large margins of profits. Unfortunately, nothing can be done about this situation, as the government is pushing AYUSH and allowing quacks to prescribe modern medicine. There's even Ayurveda post graduate course now with PG Specialities like General Surgery, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology etc. They will also be hired by these corporate hospitals in the near future. These corporate hospitals will continue to hire Ayurveda Doctors, and most people will not be aware of it. Corporate hospitals make a considerable amount of money, but they do not use it to hire qualified doctors, and the doctors they do hire are often overworked and underpaid (18 hours shifts, on call duty, understaffed departments etc) Many doctors are leaving the country for better work hours and pay due to this issue. In their greed, these corporate hospitals are filling our healthcare system with quacks and are ultimately going to destroy the system. I advise that the patients visiting corporate chain hospitals inquire about the credentials of the resident doctor who is treating them. You can ask them directly, and the hospital staff cannot lie to you. TBH, visiting medical colleges or small hospitals owned by real doctors is a far better option. These facilities often offer more affordable fees and better treatment options than corporate chain hospitals. How do I know this? Because I am a Doctor working at a well known corporate hospital and am tired of having to deal with this bullshit everyday. You don't have to take my word for it, [here's a Times of India article from 2020 on this issue - Many private hospitals using Ayush doctors in ICUs.](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/many-pvt-hospitals-using-ayush-doctors-in-icus/articleshow/78713160.cms)",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I hope this post gets more traction! This is eye opening. This is scary ...... On one hand if they are just assisting or performing under expert supervision I'm fine with it , or if hospitals allow the paitent liability clauses while informing the patients it's understandable. But to keep paitents in the dark is very bad. Same thing happens everywhere in corporate wonderland. Profit motive supersedes everything else. Most ppl are too mentally weak to resist the perks, salaries and status to push back. Notice how the owners hardly ever deal with patients directly. That distance is intentional and enables exploitation. If you just stop seeing ppl suffering, and sit in front of excel sheet whole day its becomes very easy to not care about ppl. You have to pay attention to individuals in charge. Some still have values and principle. Find them and work for them. Dont work for money minded ppl. Its a trap. And they know how to trap good ppl. They will show off how much money they have to burn. They will show off how much time they have to waste on superficial things. All to signal you want to be like me, come work for me. Most ppl realize too late what trap they have fallen into. After they get used to certain lifestyle and salary they are trapped for life. And this is why India's heathcare setup needs a serious overhaul . We are dependent on these businesses for our heathcare when they are just in for cutthroat profits To be fair, there are lots of morons in the world walking around with a copy of the PDR and a script pad. Thats alarming. I don't think those ayurvedic or homeopathic doctors have any affect patient except the placebo . They are just frauds . As a doctor it effing sucks that filthy rich hospitals like Apollo and max are doing this shit. Like they are already squeezing the last bit of money juice out of their patients, by overpricing their lab tests and medical supplies and on top of that they pay the nursing staff menial pay, and they still want to make some profit off paying junior docs as well. Like where does it end with them? They are qualified for the job. The job is just making a good invoice 3x bigger than it needs to be and pushing add-on services to rich people. It has been like this for a while now. I (MBBS) used to work at Apollo and there were quiet a few BAMS Doctors with me at the same position. Also there have been times when I applied to work at some hospital and I was refused because they didn’t want to pay 50k-60k to an MBBS when they can pay 20k and get their work done.🤷🏻‍♂️ >ayurvedic or homeopathic doctors have any affect patient except the placebo They could cause harm if they prescribe the wrong medication or if they don't prescribe right medication at right time. same thing DOES NOT happens everywhere, especially in.healtjcare where quacks are appointed in ICUs Welcome to health care of India. I can reveal much worse secrets of health system but trust me ignorance is bless. Pray don't get sick. I can't believe homeopathy is even practiced in this day and age. They should scrap every homeopathy college and let existing doctors go through some cross-skilling courses to get into modern medicine. How could Homeopaths or Ayurvedic doctors even allowed to practice modern medicine? My guess is a certain law was passed by govt to make them equal to real doctors. This is the real harm of our society's obsession with \"Indic/Vedic\" knowledge or what I call inflated ego we have developed to compensate for our backwardness. >Same thing happens everywhere in corporate wonderland. Have to disagree on this. Healthcare professionals are heavily screened and the barrier to entry is extremely high in most European countries,US and Australia. We can argue about price gouging in treatments and medicines which I would agree is pretty horrible in places like US. But regulations for giving licence to doctors are extremely rigid they don't allow quacks or pseudoscience peddlers to come even close. Even doctors who make pseudoscientific claims get their licenses revoked ( Mehmet Oz of the dr oz show had his license cancelled a long time back because he used peddle BS health supplements) That doesn't mean that a legit doctor won't make these claims after passing through accredited institutions, but the government ensures that accreditions are only given out institutions which are proper. Reminds me of this incident when I took my mother to hospital @0230 a few weeks ago. Mum caught the guy spitting sth like pan masala in his hands and then he was gobsmacked to be caught in his dirty action. Quietly discarded in the bin and pretended as if he can't see my mother. Just thought of sharing it ... Sad. Atleast I know that there will be authentic doctors when I visit a military hospital Do they really only get paid 20K? Content writers earn more than them Sadly yes.. Problem is general population are not aware about the vast difference between this quacks and medicine science due to Dr. tag given by government to these ayush guys . Like a week before my mom's friend said that her daughter is pursuing 'Daktary' from 'so and so' college. I asked her which stream she said BAMS., I bluntly told her she is wasting her time ,if she can't score in NEET she should have pursued pharmacy rather than going for quackery medicine. I would like to know it was which government idea to give Dr. Tag to these guys, even dentist and physiotherapist shouldnt be given these prefix This is totally true. Not just for doctors but even for nursing stuff. My mom is a stage 4 , carcinoma, MBS. I have to visit hospital every month. Sometimes we have to stay a night or two due to her poor health. I used to initially think that a nurse was new and may not be knowing the procedure well but to my awe and shock, most corporate hospital nurses cannot fit a cannula. If they do, it gets dislocated and drugs that are supposed to go in vein , go in the body and you will see a huge fluid build up swelling or graying… I even got frustrated by the nursing staff and changed hospitals from Rajiv Gandhi to max to fortis…and its the same story everywhere. Last week, I had a tough time as my mothers health condition deteriorated and I had to stay in hospital for over a week. Then I found out what is happening. Like most IT companies, these hospitals now do a mass recruitment of nurses from small towns and villages where the education level is not upto the mark. Not that the nurses aren’t hardworking, it’s just that they aren’t trained or experienced. So a nurse told me, we were not trained in our college. Then to support the family, we got this campus offer and we were recruited. Finally , when we reach here we are put in PGs. Sharing two to three beds and we pay a rent for staying there. The hospital also arranges a bus so that all can go together and are on time. We aren’t fed good food and our duty hours are long. On top of this if there is a casualty, shortage of staff due to personal reasons or just to support other nurse we cover shifts for each other..and this is all a very hectic experience. Most of these nurses are freshmen and they don’t know the system so they have to abide by the school culture enforced on them by the hospital. I asked her why do you even do such a job if it doesn’t pay you well and you are so understaffed and overworked . She told me the next level . The next level is Dubai and Australia.. once you complete 2 years of work ex , a good brand hospital issues an experience certificate. Naturally in these 2 years, we also learn and have a hands on experience and then we are shifted to Dubai via a agent and paid very nicely. This has been ongoing for years for the nurses from Kerala and once the system was known, the small institutes around UP, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand have all formed this close partnership with hospitals. It doesn’t end here, there’s more stuff - a lot of times , a lot of medication is indented on a patients file but these are never administered or are given a placebo. You then sell this medicines to other hospitals or pharmacy shops.. at half the price. Finally, I once became good friends with a doctor in a government hospital and asked her why do doctors in private hospitals ask us to keep repeating tests. She told me, they don’t want to do it out of their free will but it’s the corporate hospitals that force them to repeat the tests as they all must meet a certain target . It’s like sales. Every doctor must do certain number of sales or you loose your job and my next question was, you wouldn’t do it in your conscious right ? But she said - we are also like any ordinary middle class family and the whole thing starts with Aakash institute. They charge a hefty amount and take the whole year fee in max 2 installments. Then you have to pay some extra tuitions , foreign author books etc. finally no medical college accepts a child without a donation fee including the government hospitals and this is after you clear the exams or you have a top shot recommendation . So, you pile up with soo much loan that in order to give your loan you also fall in this vicious Circe. Yeah, many hospitals. Imagine the small private hospitals. They are mostly filled with these Ayurveda and Homeopathy residents. And I did BDS thinking BAMS kar ke koi fayda nahi lol 🥴 This is bang on. Being from the medical field, I always enquire about their qualifications before making an appointment. My father on the other hand, doesn't. He visited a modern medicine centre recently for his complaint, and I saw that he was seen by a homeopathy doctor. These things can easily be overseen as we trust the centre itself. This is a very informative post and thank you for bringing it to light. I don't think anyone has the guts to ask the doctor about their degree, that doesn't even pop up in your mind, especially in big hospitals. But this needs to be addressed Please reveal, awareness is important You know one of the reasons why covid became such a huge issue was due to the Chinese government pushing their native medicine or the Chinese medicine. So one of the early covid infected patient(s) took the Chinese medicine instead of the modern ones(or Western medicine like they and also like we say). That allowed the virus to mutate even faster and into a more deadly version. As a matter of fact there was a study that I read, about India being one of the potential hotspots of another pandemic. Much worse than covid. I'll link the study if I can find it. I think I saw that study being cited in one of the vox videos as well. This is the healthcare menace known as \"Integrative medicine\". These quacks love hiding behind euphemisms like \"holistic\", as if only primitive, pseudo-scientific alternative treatments can do that. Basically it's like mixing geology with alchemy and calling it \"Integrative Geology\". Which is total nonsense of-course. What the hell! Is Ayush FDA approved? Yes i meant any positive effect FDA has no bearing on Indian medical system except may be as an example. Even that's too much for quacks. For a while now, it has been known that some corporate hospitals are hiring Ayurveda and Homeopathic doctors as resident or duty doctors, and even to manage ICUs at night. The main reason for this is cost-effectiveness. However, there is rising criticism about the qualifications of these doctors and the safety of patients. It is a concern that patients may not be aware that their doctor lacks training in modern medicine, which can be risky when prescribing medications without knowledge of drug interactions and contraindications. On top of that, corporate hospitals do not always disclose that they employ Ayurveda and Homeopathic doctors, which can lead to confusion and risk for patients. Though the question arises, who will check a doctor's credentials, especially in emergency situations? When the hell is breaking loose. Still on case to case basis, patients or their relatives can protect themselves by inquiring about the credentials of the resident doctor if they suspect something is amiss. It's also a good idea to spread the word about the hospital in the city in general. Vsiting medical colleges or small hospitals owned by qualified and famous doctors who practice modern medicine exclusively may be a safer option if for patients if time permits. Government recognizes Ayurveda and Homeopathy as valid medical practices, patients must ensure they receive proper medical care by qualified professionals. After all, you only have one life, so it's not worth risking it. I also think ayurveda is good, but as a preventative measure, not in critical cases or if something exclusively requiring allopathic medicine. And homeopathy.... Well. To all the journalists lurking in this subreddit, you've got to do something to increase this post's visibility. >an allopathy centre allopathy, is an archaic and derogatory label originally used by 19th-century homeopaths to describe heroic medicine, the precursor of modern evidence-based medicine. We should not be using the term allopathy anymore. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopathic_medicine) Look there is nothing inherently bad in ayurveda. Sure there is medicinal knowledge that needs to be preserved and is potentially helpful in skilled hands of established practitioners. Problem is when the ayurveda doctors are permitted to act at par with allopathic docter and prescribe allopathy linked treatments and medicines of which they have no knowledge or only basic knowledge. A highly skilled construction mason that makes wonderful buildings doesn't necessarily become a skilled car mechanic. They are different skills. Let's keep hospitals distinct so that patients know what is the skill set of the doctor and choose accordingly - if they want ayurveda or ayush let them go to that hospital, and if they want allopathy then they go that hospital EDIT. That's quite the flood of down votes. I guess a lot of people like to go to a hospital and be treated by an ayurveda/ ayush doctor providing them allopathy or allopathic treatment / surgery. >FDA approved FDA is an American Agency. I don't think you have any idea of exactly what ICU doctors do or what Homeopathy doctors are actually taught. Please go and speak with an ICU doctor to understand what their job is. Then, please go and check the curriculum of a homeopathy medicine studies to understand exactly what they are taught in their degree. And only after that please give gyaan about this and calling people quacks. I have a cousin who actually is a BAMS who now works on ICU duty in 2 different hospitals and I spoke in detail (several hours) with him as to what exactly he does and how he has the knowledge to do what he does. (Spoiler Alert: The patients in the ICU are not being given Homeopathy treatment, if that's what people think is happening... and there are senior doctors on standby if the sh\\*t really hits the fan) Also a disclaimer: I also think Homeopathy as a branch is pseudo-science and mostly useless. Not neccesarily some do work TBF pseudoscientific stuff like homeopathy and chiropractic are licensed and practised in the US and Europe. But they can only prescribe their \"alternative remedies\". Looks like the problem OP is concerned with is such quacks are posing as allopathy doctors, diagnosing like they are allopathy doctors and prescribing allopathic medicine. I don't care much if such quacks open up their own little sheds and have dumbfucks visit them. That's still happening all over US and Europe. But if they are tricking patients into thinking that they are real medical doctors, that's really concerning. If you removed Pharmacology and some other things. All doctors whether of Modern medicine or Alternative are taught the same things by the same books. PS- okay one, comment down here if you want to say something don't pm me. Two, I'm not saying that Ayurved and Homeopathy are a valid alternative. We have a huge shortage of Doctors and medical personnel, these alt. Medical personnel have enough training to act as \"secondary caregivers\". Would you rather see your loved ones unattended in ICU? create a twitter thread and tag the authorities,I'm pretty sure twitter will for once hepl. > These quacks then go on to prescribe medications without any training in modern medicine, including pharmacology, drug interactions, and contraindications Isn't this the law of the land? If this is a real issue, shouldn't you be raising it with legislators? Yes I am aware. Even the big name hospitals in South Delhi. I have had terrible experience with them, they were trying to force an unnecessary surgery on my grandmother who never needed it. Two private hospitals had knowingly made her condition worse so that I would panic and say yes to surgery. This all happened when I was teen and my parents were abroad. So they tried to take advantage of a kid. One big private hospital in South Delhi who like to take everything to the \"Max\" told me the hospital is full and only presidential suite is available which costed one lakh plus per night not including treatment and medical. When admitted the entire hospital was empty and the amenities in the \"presidential\" suite were that the sweeper came to change the drip. This is about medical business. Same is true about all other industry and services. People are hired who are available at low wage rate and not competence. When these newbies do mistakes, the management makes them scapegoat and fires them. Repeat. Those who stay get ex-experienced by following and practicing their daily routine even to call themselves as an expert. But beyond their daily routine experience they cannot do anything more. >Please go and speak with an ICU doctor to understand what their job is. You didn't read the entire post, did you? Makes sense in the west, cuz medicine and religion evolved out of different spaces. Medicine was the domain of the local barber in the west historically. Here we have lot of overlap between religion/health in who ppl run too in the villages when they get sick. Main point being corporate robots are programmed to chose the most profitable option. If there is a cheap supply of govt certified docs of whatever variety they will 100% take advantage of it. They are circumventing the protocols like they do in everything else in India. Because the authorities let them, either by bribery or by sheer lack of care or empathy. I am not against corporate hospitals hiring ayu or homeo docs, as long as they strictly practice what they learned, and don't get involved in allopathic practices at all. Why are you guessing? That is pretty much the directive being sent out, by the medical regulatory body that replaced the old (professional but alleged incompetent) one. My bad. Corrected in my comment. Thank you. Extremely difficult. From the second year onwards the fundamentals itself are completely different, with homeo and ayurveda being pseudoscientific. Like ? sugarcubes ? Jokes on us. You did only BDS, I'm pursuing MDS too 🥴 Yeah American healthcare is expensive as fuck but I don't see it doing any fuckups like this. I was glad thinking Indian healthcare system is waay better than American because of how cheap and effective it is. Turns out the system is well fucked in India and is beyond repair. EDIT: One of my friend who works as a nurse at AIIMS also confirmed he's seen too many quacks at work. You simply ask them, \"what are your qualifications doctor/Sir/Ma'am?\" Alternatively, look at the doctor's panel list, they are supposed to list the degrees as well. BAMS is pretty much considered equivalent to MBBS by govt. The fact that they are allowed to use \"Dr\" prefix is a red flag itself. BAMS graduates being allowed to use \"Dr\" prefix is a big issue. They should not be allowed to use the same. Call them vaids or whatever they were called in old times. But \"Dr\" is wrong. Gosh, am I jealous or what! I was always interested in psychology! In case I land up in US/Canada, we might cross paths doing MPH/MHA! 😅 >what I call inflated ego we have developed to compensate for our backwardness. Perfectly put ! okay. which degrees to avoid? Just BAMS one, right? > You can ask them directly, and the hospital staff cannot lie to you. What guarantee is there that the staff do not lie about it? They can simply deny it too, right? Can you elaborate why do you call it pseudoscientific? BAMS= Ayurvedic BHMS= Homeopathy What degree to avoid would depend on what branch of medicine you wish to go for. That is for you to decide. Indian healthcare is fucked. Beyond repair at this point. The patient also looses the opportunity for right treatment at the right time.. (Meanwhile his disease may become worse) Because it’s not based on any real science. I'm assuming you're genuinely curious here and this wasn't a rhetorical question. Homeopathic medications rely on diluting the active ingredient to an extreme level where sometimes it might not even be present in the solution. The dilution they use is equivalent to dropping a sugar cube in the Indian Ocean, then drinking one drop from it expecting the contents of the sugar cube to be present in the drop of water. I could get into proper details of why it's pseudoscience but that would need a completely different discussion thread and this comment alone won't suffice. Honestly you don’t treatment until they see a credit card. That should be enough to make your blood boil. They usually list their qualifications. They can’t put MBBS in their name if they haven’t done that. What exactly does he do at ICU? Since he is an Ayurvedic doctor, how come he is able to prescribe modern (allopathic) medicine? [Here's why homeopathy is hella pseudoscientific](https://youtu.be/8HslUzw35mc) Because from a legal perspective, the act of lying is considered a more egregious offense than the act of withholding information. In other words, the deliberate dissemination of false or misleading information is viewed as a more serious transgression than the omission of relevant details. Isn't homeopathy related improvement in any condition mostly placebo effect? The problem is you can’t spend time analyzing and verifying the qualifications of doctors in times of emergency (say a person requires immediate attention at late hours). You can’t keep visiting multiple hospitals to know which one doesn’t employ ayush ~~doctors~~ practitioners in trauma care. You don’t have such a luxury when life is at stake. The govt seems to have paved the way for such a setup back in 2022 - [ToI article](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/vadodara/ayush-doctors-to-be-trained-in-primary-trauma-care/amp_articleshow/90990795.cms), despite opposition from IMA. As they rightly point out, it is mixing of different streams of diagnosis and treatment. Even if the ayush ~~doctors~~ practitioners are trained in using modern equipment, I would be as comfortable as allowing a dentist to operate in my eye. The scientific method is based on repeatable and reliable results. And then finding the causation. Not based on correlation. This is a known fact. And when shit hits the fan, the media claims that the doctor was at fault, which the common people, obviously think is a ‘medical doctor’. Exactly if we say something to ayurvedic people assume it's the disrespect of Hindu traditions lol but it's completely wrong. It was good for earlier times when we had nothing but now we have allopathy so why even bother about using else . This statement is false: [source](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/1800-studies-later-scientists-conclude-homeopathy-doesnt-work-180954534/) Yes.. definitely genuine. I didn't know. Thanks for the explanation👍 Thanks for the explanation. Wonder why does it have so many takers/believers then Homeopathic doctors do not have the same skills and know how that MBBS graduates do. In my opinion, we should also avoid calling Ayurveda and Homeopathy practitioners \"doctors\". They are not doctors, we shouldn't call them that. Quacks is a better term. Thanks for keeping an open mind Yes. I get that but wanted a deeper explanation and got that from other replies. Thanks mate Yes I agree. It's only when you have the time to make due diligence that this comes handy. We're screwed in other situations. ??? This is false. This is so sad on so many levels. I had some skin irritation earlier last year and I looked up \"Skin Doctors Near me\" and came up with several options. I chose the best one from the ratings on Google maps I visited the clinic, she checked out the problem and started writing the medications on a piece of paper. Fair enough, standard practice. She demanded 800 rupees consulting fee, which I though is fine given she was highly rated. When I went to get the meds from clinic and medical store, everyone of them were \"herbal\" and \"homeopathic\" and I got scammed because I assumed I visited a proper doctor and not a quack. Not to mention the meds didn't do shit and eventually I had to visit the government hospital and seek out help from a proper skin specialist. This is getting out of hands certainly Yes, no one can be prepared for a trauma event. And I have not seen patients booking appointments at late night either. So essentially, there’s no situation when this comes in handy. Same with Railway Hospitals. They have authentic doctors who have cleared UPSC IRHS and then only are serving the National Transporter. My asthama was cured because of An ayurvedic doctor. And that is great. I believe ayurveda is great preventative medicine. And it truly does help alot of people. But there's alot of misplaced trust in then even for serious ailments and diseases which shouldn't be the case Only Arizona, Connecticut, and Nevada offer homeopathic medical licenses. fda has NO approved drugs classified as homeopathy. To your point whether they can still operate, yes but outside regulations and except those 3 states they will not be given medical licenses If they have medical licenses ,they can still practice homeopathy in the other states. But they won't get a license specific to homeopathy, that doesn't exist. If they choose the later part they will only be able to give non. FDA approved medicines which the patients will have to be notified about. Tell me where your cousin works so I can avoid those hospitals. Homeopathy is considered a pseudomedicine because it lacks scientific evidence to support its fundamental principles and claims. According to homeopathic theory, illnesses can be treated by administering highly diluted solutions of substances that would cause similar symptoms in healthy individuals. However, these solutions are diluted to the point where there is often little to no active ingredient left in the final product, which goes against the basic principles of pharmacology and biochemistry. Furthermore, there is no credible scientific evidence to support the notion that homeopathic remedies are effective in treating any medical condition beyond the placebo effect. What I meant to say is not all ayurvedic doctors are quacks. i know people like Ramdev baba scam people in the name of ayurveda but that doesn't make ayurveda shit...there are few good ayurvedic colleges which grooms good ayurveda doctors... Subjects like Anatomy, physiology, toxicology, pathology, etc are taught in all three courses. Is that False? Which govt idea? Your first guess will be right. I don't disagree. But when you make them stand in place of an actual doctor, they're quacks to me. I myself take ayurvedic medicine for my digestive issues and it does help. Literally go to an ayurvedic hospital. But if I went to a private institution for an emergency, I want a modern medicine doctor and an ayurvedic or homoeopathic doctor there is a quack to me Wtf thats horrifying. A few years ago when we just visiting Delhi. My dad got sick pretty bad. He had to go to the hospital, the ding dong who called himself a doctor said my dad had a stomach bug. Gave him some meds and sent him on the way. He still felt pretty ill a few days after. After we got home, he went to his regular doctor and did a chest x ray, it was pneumonia. But we have some real morons practicing medicine here too. The govt has given the green light and opened the door for corporations to potentially harm and kill their citizens. When these actual erosions of citizens safety happen, they are being distracted by religious, cultural and class bias. India is now in the hands of big corporations and not it’s people. This is not much different than the East India company… GTFO here with that bullshit! AYUSH graduates are not even taught biochemistry, they don’t about the various receptors in our body through which drugs act, they don’t know endocrinology, they don’t know about the autonomic nervous system, they don’t even know how to read an ECG. How are they qualified to prescribe modern evidence based medicine? Moreover, there are certain medications that are not recommended for pregnant women as they have the potential to cross the placenta and cause developmental abnormalities or malformations in the growing fetus. This phenomenon is known as teratogenicity, and Doctors need to be aware of this to avoid prescribing such drugs during pregnancy. My cousin is a BAMS graduate and he's earning around 6lpa, When I got to know that BAMS is just waste of time, I thought my cousin will end up unemployed. News to me. Thanks a million This needs to be cross posted to world or to all india specific subs. One end we project health care as next frontier for our exports/job opportunities ; then allow f**k up like this. Homeopaths and Vaidyas view the body very differently compared to MBBS doctors. It's not just the treatments prescribed that vary between the three, they're completely different degrees. India : Elect idiotic politicians. They pass policies which can affect the people. Indian people : Shocked Yep. My friend is an ayurvedic doctor that runs ICU. Wife of another friend is a homeopathic doctor who works on duty in another hospital as well. They both said they were taught to checkup patients with allopathic methods during their studies & training since what you have mentioned in a pretty common practice in Mumbai now. Homeopathic “medicine” is created by successive dilutions of the order of 100. A 30c (a measure of strength in homeopathy) has some substance diluted to 10^60. If you know basic high school chemistry, you would know one mole is about 10^23 atoms. So after homeopathic dilution the probability of you finding a single atom of the dissolved material in your solution is about 10^(-37). To compare, the water on earth is about 1.2 quintillion litres ~ 10^21 liters. If you pour 1 liter of coke into the ocean, there is more coke in the ocean than there is the original solvent contained in homeopathic solution. My uncle once defended homeopathy by saying everyone around him says it works and it's just me who says it's fraud. \"So you're saying you've surrounded yourself with idiots like yourself?\" Wasn't probably the best way to respond to that. 2/10 wouldn't recommend but you bet I'm proud of it. There's way too many people who've bought into these pseudosciences that it's impossible to make an average Indian understand how stupid these things are. That's quite an analogy! It begs the question.. why does it still have so many takers? Those who use homeopathy.. aren't they aware of this? Yes. I agree to that but later year subjects like the once I mentioned are same and those makeup the bulk of the course(s). Ayurvedic /Homepathic doctors who give these treatments are like people with authority but no responsibility.If the Ayurvedic/homeopathic treatment fails or there are complications then the doctor is never held responsible. Whereas in case of modern medicine doctor is help responsible for failure of his treatment... Thank you informing, i was not aware of this fact. I can't emphasis this enough, BUT START ASKING QUESTIONS TO YOUR DOCTOR. You are literally handing over your health and healing responsibility to them, you got every right to ask questions. Any sane and professional doctor will be more than willing to be answering your questions. And it's not about having guts to question the doctor, if i want to be treated by a mbbs grad, i want that. I have the right to know the qualifications of the person who is providing me healthcare. Probably started as a fad since its treatment methods were very different to allopathy and stuck around because corporations saw this as an opportunity to push homeopathy propaganda to make more money. well homeopathy really aint hindu medicine. Mujhe kya Mera toh chota bhai MBBS student hai, Wo bhi Gormint college mein. Please reveal Profit motive doesn't belong as a component of the healthcare apparatus! Ayurvedic ~~doctors~~ quacks What does that incident have to do with the point OP brings up???? Any self respecting medical doctor will mention they qualifications on their baner or website or board. Please check for that, and if there's some abbreviation that i don't understand, i do a quick Google search Why are you being downvoted?? I agree if people want ayurveda they can go to those hosp or those professionals. But if i want a medical mbbs grad, i have the right to seek them out. It should be openly stated Ayurveda at best can be described as a proto-science. They had some great ideas for their time. Undoubtedly the originators of Ayurveda were geniuses . But whatever ideas they had are primitive by today's standards. \"Science and Society in Ancient India\" by Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya is an excellent book to understand the ideas of medicinal science in Ayurveda in a more secular perspective. Bottom line, we are not made of the pancha bhoothas or diseases are not created by the imbalance in raktha, pitha and kabha. We know we are made of atoms and molecules, our body is one large chemical reaction and primarily we are made of cells. Diseases are far more complex originating from a variety of reasons from internal mechanism failure to external factors like bacteria and viruses. Promoting Ayurveda is equivalent to promoting the methods of Hippocrates by people in Europe because he was some ancient ancestor. Unfortunately unlike in the west Ayrveda or any proto-scientific material in India is deeply entangled with religion and therefore instead of advancing they got frozen in the past eventually becoming superstitious nonsense preserved and practiced simply because of religious faith and credulity of the general public. On a tangential note, the history of science is rather interesting. The Greeks, Indians, Muslims(mostly Iraq, Iran, Afganisthan) and later modern Europeans were masters at different points in human history, preserving and advancing it to what we know today. He works for Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and Sahyadri Hospital (both in Pune) The entire post is about the lack of transparency. If i wanted a ayurvedic professional, i would have not visited a big shot hosp like apollo The point is, that the doctors in ICU are not giving patients Ayurvedic treatments. This information needs to go out internationally. Once the Medical Tourism income dries up, these private hospitals will automatically clean up their act. This needs to be urgently addressed. This is going to create havoc in medical care in the future. I first came to be aware of it in 2010, when my mom was diagnosed with TB. She had a infected cyst on her neck, a common indicator of TB. The neighbourhood GP suggested Lotus Hospital, Vashi for removal of said cyst before beginning TB treatment. The doctors in the hospital started her on RKT, a common treatment regimen. But my mom reacted very violently to it - she had severe diarrhoea and vomiting. So much so that she became catatonic. The medicine was stopped. But the doctors insisted there was no alternative. After one more try with the same results, they directed us to their “senior”. He said the same fucking thing. Incidentally, I happen to see the certificate framed on the GP’s wall and found it to be on BAMS. I didn’t know then what it meant and had to Google. That’s when I consulted a pulmonologist in Coimbatore. He immediately put my mind to rest. He suggested an alternative but with a longer duration. Just speaking with him was a different experience. His medication eventually cured her without any side effects. This is my most personal experience with BAMS but there are others where they misdiagnosed diseases causing at the least panic and at the most death. If they are taught the very same things, why is the degree different??? What do you think about ChatGPT prescribing for some ailments in near future? Exactly. But people seem to like the excitement of not knowing You are not getting an Ayurvedic treatment at these hospitals. This is where the OP is flat out lying. That's why I mentioned at the beginning for people like you, \"Reminded me\", and at the end, \"thought of sharing it\". This is just a demand-supply issue. India creates very few MBBS doctors per year so someone has to pick up the slack. Your high salaries are only justified by the fact that there are fewer of you in number. It's not like we have a situation where a large number of doctors in India are competing among themselves to serve in rural areas or in night shifts. Most refuse to serve outside the comfort of cities and the rest pack up their bags and leave the country asap after they graduate. The medical community in India has created stupid rules which prevent opening of a larger number of medical colleges because the scarcity of mbbs doctors suits them as it drives up their collective average income and then they have the audacity to claim that only the 90,000 odd doctors India gets annually are the only people brilliant enough in the country to get into this profession. Fuck off. Medicine in India is just another example of artificial scarcity created to prop up the small minority of people who get to enter this field. It's just like Chartered Accountancy. There's no reason for there being so few Chartered Accountants in a country like India but that's how they have designed the system. Your problem with homeo and ayurveda is not because you think that they actively harm people. You already do that by making medical services unavailable for the vast majority of this country's population. Your problem is that they are filling in some critical vacancies which is making your value do down. Cry me a river. Edit: Yes i know that alternate system medics are not the best option for filing the positions they have been filling. That was never my point. However, my point of artificial scarcity still stands. Why are there so few medical schools in India and so many engineering colleges? What's preventing all these politicians from opening medical schools when it's such a profitable business? The medical education for alternative systems have been shit for a while now. Almost all of them end up practicing and prescribing modern medicines withour proper training and background. It's not about the treatment plan, it's about the healthcare professional who is gonna handle my case. Yes, so first of all, lets dissect this: 1) How do you know they are \"incompetent\"? Are there statistics on increased number of ICU deaths of mishaps where BAMS doctors are being placed in ICU care? 2) How the hell do you know there is: \"zero knowledge\"? Again, I asked this to OP and he just ignored it - do you actually know the curriculum taught in BAMS? What skill sets are required for ICU management? Please note, we are talking about ICU care, we are not talking about disease diagnostics or deciding which medicine to prescribe to the patient. Have you spent any time in assessing whether the BAMS curriculum provides the homeopathy doctors with enough knowledge about human physiology required for ICU care? Do you know that BAMS doctors have to do an additional training course before they are put in charge of ICU care? Do you know what is taught in that course? How are you just passing all these judgements about \"incompetence\" and \"zero knowledge\" without really analyzing all these factors? Problem is further complicated by the fact that newly minted mbbs doc is not guaranteed to have practical ideas to deal with issues as his knowledge is bookish (assumed) there is surely dearth of quality docs new generation docs but can't blame them when entire country's scientific temper is gone to \"amrit kaal\" and the mbbs system is rigged to promote slavery and reservation Is there more about this in traditional media (like the TOI article you shared above)? Would like to know more about this and which all hospitals are involved? Also, the article is a covid time article, so is it that even pre covid and post covid, non mbbs doctors have been treating patients in corporate hospitals or is it that they were appointed due to lack of staff during covid? Indian medical and health insurance systems have imbibed only the bad qualities/drawbacks of the American system. Same near my house BAMS MD Medicine Yaha MBBS drop le rahe hai Medicine ki seat ke liye phir bhi nahi milta hai I really love these whistleblowers People aren't aware of what it is. That's literally the only reason. They want an alternate form of medicine with zero side effects and that's what homeopathy claims to do. Most people don't even recall what they studied in school and they also love shutting down the critical thinking part of their brain. lol— go ask pm for tea. not women. you filthy fraud Homeopathy is German quackery He does not prescribe modern allopathic medicine. There are specialists who are in charge of the treatment who prescribe medicine. He monitors the patients, carries out any procedures that are required, does check-ups, documentation etc. In case an emergency life saving procedure is required, they do that as well. Why shouldn't dentists be given that title? They practice medicine, are thoroughly educated in anatomy, Physiology, pathology and pharmacology and all their subjects, they can even specialize is surgery and perform related medical procedures. Dentists are doctors. And physiotherapists are allowed to call themselves doctors as long as they suffix PT in their name. Plus, physios do DPTs (doctor of Physiotherapy) to enhance their knowledge, which gives them the Dr. title. Ayurveda and homeopathy are questionable, but dentists and physiotherapists do not deserve this slander. Their scope of practice is clear, proven and evidence based. Don't degrade these professions if you're not aware of how necessary they are. What you are writing is the issue some 5-6 years back Now even some MDs are not getting jobs Waw True that I do agree with what OP said and it is true, but i just don't understand the hate against BAMS doctors, and reading all the comments in here just really shows how blnidsided people are when it comes to ayurvedic medicine. As someone who has both MBBS and BAMS doctors in his family i am the perfect person to share my experience. To start this, BAMS doctors are not \"quacks\", but if you place them in a hospitable which deals with modern medicine ofc they are clueless. It isn't as bad as the general population thinks, in some places its worse but in most its not that bad. The hospital only benefits if the prescription being sold are of a certain value, this necessarily does not mean that the given prescription is \"needed\", in some/~~most~~ cases a low powered drug will also do the job. Then again the entire point of massive hospitals is to make money because it also is a form of businesses. THIS is the reason why a lot of people prefer government hospitals, or government aided hospitals. One of the best example which I have from the recent time is this, there's a certain medical owner in my city and the owner had a nerve damage or something along those lines, he was unable to move and it would hurt a shit-ton and he was basically left bed ridden. After visiting at least 5 hospitals (local and better), they were unsatisfied with the outcome of the discussion/ appointment. These 5 hospitals house some pretty well known doctors with vast experience under their belt. At the end they decided to go to the Bombay Hospital and were quiet impressed with the doctors, he had a surgery and the patient is absolutely amazing rn. The second example is of the same family where an elderly person had some xyz problem and hence they went to some pretty good doctors and the end result was a prescription of 8k for one month. Obviously after paying this amount, they thought the patient would feel good and let him go to his hometown but obviously it didn't work out. He was still in severe pain and was once again bought in Mumbai and they visited the bombay hospital again where he was prescribed a strip of rs.800 and he started feeling better after 2\\~3 days. Moving onto the hate towards ayurveda and why its mostly towards people who have a degree in BAMS but practise modern medicine. My family has BAMS doctors practising from 24 years, which is a considerable amount of time and their practise has been superb. Some of the many thing which I would like to mention here are, once again they are through experiences. During covid, when it was august 2020 and covid was causing havoc my family was started showing all the symptoms of covid and it was obvious we had covid. Now at this position the best option was to go to a hospital but with the usage of steriods and a hazy line of treatment towards covid patients we decided against it, which is a pretty bold move in itself but apparently ayurveda deals with a shit-ton of viruses and covid could also be dealt with. For the next 2 weeks the medicines we were under really helped and eventually everyone stopped with the symptoms and well there's that. The medicines which we took were pretty hard to remember but I do know a few which I took everyfuckingdayandnight, it included vasajivni with some water which apparently helped with blood (I personally have no idea), we also took guduchi boiled in water which tasted like absolute bubllshit, it was most bitter thing in the fucking world. Along with this, there were other powders being consumed with honey and it was such a routine to follow. But it worked and dare I say it worked better than laying in a hospital bed. My second experience with ayurveda is when I personally had to deal with the shittiest cough ever, I have a recovering cough which just shows up every year and it sucks because it just WONT LEAVE. It was so fucking bad, the bottles of the cough syrups just sitting on that shelf is still a sight to witness. From modern drugs to some weird tasting ayurvedic cough syrups nothing worked. Absolutely nothing would completely stop my cough. Which is when I was told about this thing called a \"vaman\", it basically meant I had to vomit my cough. and I was absolutely against it. Who in their right mind would fucking do that, even tho I ended up doing it I would never do it again unless absolutely necessary because man. i was given powders to eat and some other stuff before starting the \"ritual\". The procedure was pretty simple, I was starved for a day and then light food was given the night before and I woke up feeling hungry asf and also tired, and the afternoon came by and I had to to eat rice with milk and it was a bit weird but to vomit you really need to overeat, and I had to do it on purpose. So I ate as much as I could, to the point where I wanted to throw up and then I was given two full glasses of salt water with some powder mixed in it and THAT was it. I threw up so hard, istg I saw all the rice and then I could see the cough and I kept throwing up to the point where my stomach hurt and I was to stop when I felt something bitter in my mouth and yes it was extremely bitter and I was absolutely drained. but I haven't had cough since then and it's the best feeling to not deal with shitty cough, Rather than trying to figure out which one to avoid, just remember that if the qualifications do not include at least MBBS, then the individual is not a doctor of modern medicine. Specialists will have further qualifications like MD, MS, DM, etc but minimum you should look for is MBBS. Homeopathy medicines are not in info fancy packing, right? They are without packing I'm proud of you too thanks Call them __Vaidya__ which is a term that was used in earlier decades for Aurveda practitioners. Or __Hakim__ for practitioners of Unani system of medicines. I kid you not but one of the recent hiring in multispeciality hospital had advertisement quoting \"MEDICAL OFFICER (MBBS/BAMS/BHMS/PHYSIOTHERAPY)\" Most of the hospitals hire bams/bhms only and they have the NABH certification. Some of the opd clinics in my area have the degrees that you won't even find on google. The quality of Healthcare is going down, only the quantity of Healthcare improving. Ever heard of the placebo effect? Most of the layman doesn't have the knowledge about the different degrees. I have met many literate people who will visit Doctor but does not know the kind of doctor one is. The problem is with the government where they are allowing any Tom, Dick and Harry to Prefix Dr and practice evidence based medicine. Even when you make due diligence, only the consultant doctors can be verified who take one or two round in a day, other than that every duty doctor round the clock are not real doctors. >How could Homeopaths or Ayurvedic doctors even allowed to practice modern medicine? My guess is a certain law was passed by govt to make them equal to real doctors. Yes It happened right around Covid >Why shouldn't dentists be given that title? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BCXJ3yC65o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BCXJ3yC65o) These fancy hospitals have always cut corners on junior doctors. They’ll have flashy consultants, but the entire chain below is subpar. This Ayurveda nonsense is the natural progression of this. I’m writing this from a crowded recovery room in Ganga Ram Hospital, but I feel much safer than I did in glitzy hospital (one of the ones mentioned in the post) a couple of years ago, when they nearly killed me due to an overlooked allergic reaction. GR is a teaching hospital and they recruit excellent junior doctors, despite being private. The OPDs feel like slightly cleaner government hospitals. The waiting rooms are rammed. But I’d still prefer to come here than trust these multi speciality hospitals with procedures. Homeopathy medicines get fancy packing like modern medicines. Just that they're completely unregulated. According to Ayurvedic Physiology, semen is formed by bone marrow/inside bone cavity which completely contradicts Modern Physiology. So tell me should they both be considered the same? Its not a demand-supply issue when they would happily hire BAMS or BHMS rather than a MBBS on the post of a medical officer just because they have to pay less. They should ideally disclose this fact but its hidden. Its not vacancies filled by a substitute. This is substitution based on salary. Many of my MBBS friends have not been able to get jobs as BAMS and BHMS graduates are preffered in job interviews. Yes, correct. > In India, the term is used to distinguish conventional modern medicine from Ayurveda, homeopathy, Unani and other alternative and traditional medicine traditions, especially when comparing treatments and drugs. Same source. BAMS = Ayurvedic, BUMS = Unani, BHMS = Homeopathy Homeopathic doctors who purely practice homeopathy are basically witch doctors who are not even as qualified as Ayurvedic doctors. At least Ayurvedic doctors are good in their own domain, i.e. general wellness and getting rid of cough, etc. The main principle of homeopathy is that dilution strengthens medicine, and their medicine is basically just water. Didn't know, happy to know So instead of training more Doctors, we have simply promoted quacks to Doctors. Holy COPIUM BAMS are not quacks. They study modern medicine in college, and are also allowed to prescribe them. I didn't say Ayurvedic. Modern medicine is a part of curriculum. I don't understand why you're getting down voted. Right wingers actually run this narrative in their WhatsApp circles that \"allopathy will get you converted to Christianity so beware\" and \"the head of IMA is Christian that's why they are opposing AYUSH\". They used them during pandic where is the proof that they are still doing now ? Can you give proof that they still doing it as your post claims . Your article is of 2020 . Yes, I am not saying people are not using it. I am just saying that it is not an appropriate usage. I don't understand why Homeopathic and Ayurved doctors are being called quacks. My family has been consulting a homeopathic doctor for 25+ years and he has come through for us every time. In certain situations, his meds have worked better than allopathic medicine. So I absolutely cannot agree with the undermining of homeopathy and Ayurved practice. Homeopathy I can understand the negative outlook but Ayurveda has merit when it is done by doctors that know their shit. I personally saw lot of improvement for multiple issues that allopathy couldn’t cure… headaches, sinus issues and even minor ligament tears Fun fact: a relative of mine is a naturopathy practitioner. He went through a course for it some 15 years back. He has one magical cure for all ailments that is \"stop meat, stop carbs, eat natural fruits, eat less\". But since the time Modi has officially declared all quacks and fakirs as medical doctors, this man goes around calling himself a doctor. Many people around him go to him with their problems. Moral of the story: in a democracy, people get what they deserve. The people voted for an uneducated egoistic hateful man to run the country and now they are slowly by slowly reaping it's benefits. Wait and watch as all other modern checks and balances of society are destroyed in India. Looking at advent of AI Large Language Models, I don’t think even MBBS doctors will stay competitive. Today itself GPT-4 demonstrated its capabilities by passing final year medical exams with astounding scores. Can’t wait to get rid of all the doctor species. Reminded me of this article, [‘It is modern medicine, not allopathy’](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/it-is-modern-medicine-not-allopathy/article29612000.ece). Was there any time during your asthma where you had an unexpected asthma attack? What did you do then? Can you say the same for plastic surgery???? I had a neighbour(absolute nutcase, fraud) he called himself doctor. He claimed he was a \"physiotherapist doctor\". His education was a 6 month course in how to give massage. So basically a malishwala. But he addressed himself as a doctor and had all these men to give massage and that was his setup. Modi/Shah SOP, change the question itself to make one look good even with shit answers, who needs to solve the actual problem. And then we had that FMGE - Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (for those who do medical studies abroad) nonsense which was unnecessarily hard with students not even shown marks (plus other shenanigans), all this prevented actual modern medicine adept professionals from joining an already Doctor deficient country like India. It's being replaced by National Exit Test (NExT) but I doubt it will be any different. Medical bodies are also bureaucracies in themselves. They are a power center in their own babu-like way doing babu-like things. This really boggles my mind. Like why would GoI allow this to happen. Doctors are getting trained with no cost to India AND Coming back to India and we prevent them to practicing. Instead GoI officially (PMO literally does official meets on this) does talks & deals with US, UK to force them to get even more Indians certain Visa categories so that more Indians (after having being trained here, being part of the Dependent Numerator of the Dependency Ratio, i.e. what literally/definitionally forms Demographic Dividend) can go abroad and send Remittances. For freaking what. India's been topping the Remittances ranking for decades now. One could buy the argument this was done because India was poor so needed sources of funding, TILL the time it could do things on its own. Freaking 40+ years is not enough, then what is. Banana republic levels of incompetence giving away the only real & credible thing this place has, i.e. Human Capital. And then prevent doctors who are essentially coming for free or if not that then at least joining the Non-Dependent (Work force Denominator) part of Dependency Ratio, i.e. which makes Demographic Dividend work in reality. Such a mess. /rant I know about FMGE. One of my friends' brother did his MBBS from China but could not clear FMGE. However, he has cleared FMGE-like exam of Bahrain, where he practiced for nearly a decade and then Britain. He is capable of treating British and Bahraini patients but not Indian, logic of FMGE. This is so true one of school friend did \"unani\" and currently working in a private hospital at 16k/month where the majority of specialist doctor visit and he takes care of the ICU and emergencies..i asked him why he explained there are not much of job opportunities both in private and government sector for someone who did any of the AYUSH course so to make a living they do that.. Kinda sad but true! Management in American healthcare is raising a different kind of beast by disguising Nurse Practitioners and Physicians assistants as doctors, but it's probably better than what we're doing in this scenario It is a common problem. These ayurvedic doctors are more like glorified nurses, and are instructed to follow orders of a proper doctor. But in times of emergency, they are prone to making mistakes. It is the public who are being made fools, since they are being made to pay exorbitant sums for the services of these quacks. If ayurvedic/unani/homeopathic guys can be doctors, then so can a rickshaw puller, who learnt stuff from YouTube. Legally a lot of things don't get done in the expected manner. So I doubt that they will be afraid to lie about it. We voted for this Can’t begin to describe how fucked up the situation is. As an MBBS doctor while I was looking for jobs last year, there were some centres who would have one vacancy for MBBS doctors and upto 5 for BHMS/BAMS doctors. I asked around and some friends and seniors said that in their experience, centres will hire 1 MBBS doctor to do all the prescribing and other paper work and will hire BAMS/BHMS doctors because they can pay them a third of the MBBS doctor. Their whole aim is to cut costs even if there’s only 1 qualified doctor putting in the meds and signing off notes for many floors. In practice, it’s not possible for one person to go on every round and see every patient across multiple wards while also writing notes, putting in orders, checking their own assigned patients, attending rounds for those patients and also double checking notes and orders for their colleagues before signing off, so they have to go by what the BAMS/BHMS note down from their rounds which at times can be very wrong. I had a friend in a situation like this in a prominent cardiac ward who was given grossly incorrect med orders and very obviously picked up on it. Unfortunately every time he’d have to call up the consultant to confirm these things because it’d be a he said-they said issue and every time he’d end up being yelled at for not being on the round (which isn’t humanly possible to be in multiple rounds at the same time). He quit after like 3 weeks. Ask them to replace ayurvedic with modern medicine hundreds of serious I'll patients dies I know ayurvedic has its merit since my cousin(big brother) studied ayurvedic but he said it himself it's never replacement to opinion or prescription of normal doctor when I went to gastroenterologist This is so scary. My parents and I will always enquire about the qualification of the doctors before making appointments. Dad is very particular about this. I remember a particular incident where in I had been to ayurveda doc, a pretty well known chain, on my aunt's insistence. Though I knew I would never take ayurvedic meds and even my parents would seriously ask me not to. The doc prescribed some medicines and I asked her about the components and informed her that I am highly allergic to a certain compound. The doc insisted that I give it a try and she was not bothered at all. I was telling her I will have serious reaction if I consume it and she just brushed it off. We just left without further talk. That was the first and the last time I ever visited a ayurvedic doc. 1. Low number of doctors= is due to low number of medical colleges. This is due to lower spending by the government in the health sector. 2. Doctors don't serve in rural areas because it is not safe for us. We risk getting murdered by the villagers if we can't save their patients. Plus, villagers tend to be backward and conservative, and our wives/girlfriends have a difficult time here. I actually work in a village, right now, but would leave in a couple of months because of this reason. Again, the government has not educated/developed these areas. 3. Even the bottom half of this 90,000 is not worth treating patients without experience/someone else supervising. The knowledge required is that extensive/tough. The ayurveda/homeopathic/ unani guys were the ones below this. 4. Doctors want more seats. Makes it easier for us to get one We are not clamouring for less. But maintain quality. Can't have seats in a college which has patients only on paper( this happens even now in some colleges, since Indian patients flock to overcrowded government hospitals) 5. Ayurveda - the medicine has active ingredients, but untested. Can either harm or benefit. Has no cure for most serious ailments. It is like applying mud/turmeric on a gunshot wound. Homeopathy - can't work, as it doesn't have any active ingredients (since they believe in extreme dilution.) Both are considered pseudo-science in many developed countries. This is absolutely true. And in many places instead of giving prescription, doctors and quacks are in the habit of giving tablets directly in paper packs. I remember once fighting with a doctor in Ahmedabad due to this. I understand that many people are not in a position to question this. Doctors treating patients should explain this. Many educated people are not even bothered to ask the docs. Unfortunately this is something the government has paved ways for Homeopathy and ayurvedic medicines DO work BUT within its reach/ domain/practicality. I myself visited a homeopathy doctor for my skin disease which alopathy couldn't cure for 1-2 years and I did get cured after that. But you can't rush to a homeopathy or ayurvedic doctor in case of an emergency like fracture, chest pain, accident, tuberculosis etc etc. and expect to get cured. They're not getting jobs because only a certain number of doctors can operate in an area before it reaches saturation point. If everyone is trying to work at the top hospital of the district, many of them are not going to make the cut. That's how it works in every other field. Have your friends tried moving to a Tier 2/3 City? Not every engineering job requires the skills of an IIT grad to fill the position. Sometimes even a BSc grad can do the same job. Maybe even better. Hospitals just can't afford to put expensive MBBS doctors in every position which doesn't require the same level of skill. I mean, these hospitals are operating fine with BAMS/BHMS grads right? Does that mean Ayurvedic/Homeo doctors are more competent than what MBBS doctors believe them to be, or, are MBBS doctors trying to work in positions they're obviously overqualified for? It can only be one of these 2 reasons. We're all proud of him in these trying times Good it well reducing monopoly of mbbs doctors who have started to loot common man. Are you telling me India has run out of positions for MDs? That there are so many post graduate doctors in India that many are not getting jobs? Or is it because these MD students are trying to get a job in a Tier 1 city which has already reached saturation point and don't want to relocate to a Tier 2/3 City? Everyone should have a choice where they want to work but if you're making a choice which is less likely to work out, don't go and blame others for your failure. At the post of 'Medical officer,' you can work in two ways. You consistently keep reporting to the consultant who has admitted the patient or you can provide him observations as well as information and create a feedback system which enables better patient care. My friends are already in tier 2/3 cities. And who gave you this idea that there's a saturation point and only a fixed number of doctors can work in a region at a given time? BAMS/BHMS graduates keep informing consultants about what the situation is but they cannot actively observe certain things which an MBBS graduate can due to difference in experience and curriculum. They can eventually get to that level but they'll still be capped at some point where they can't learn more things apart from what they handle regularly. As i said, this is purely a matter of wage difference. An uninitiated MBBS graduate will get anywhere about 30k for doing the same job a BAMS/BHMS will do for 10-15k. As in my case, I had a good experience of handling a general ICU, cardiac ICU, and the ER alone but still got snubbed by a freshie BAMS graduate just because they had to pay me 50k whereas she agreed to work for 12k. In ahmedabad, I have come across only Sterling hiring qualified doctors. All the other big multispeciality hire bams/bhms. I agree. Don't know about other industries, but GPT 4/LLMs are going to change the medical industries for the better and i am super excited! I'm so fucking proud of you. Proper doctor se pooch le bro. Or just Google it. You are just 10 years back Failure is from your side I'm an ICU doctor, and I agree with him. Tell me how he is wrong? These guys get hired because they can act like doctors, which most nurses can't. Plenty of nurses are smarter than the BAMS folk. BUMS slso Joke's on us. We are getting exactly what we voted for. Plenty of skills are required in ICU care, but the doctor's job is to decide on the treatment/ management. The person with the higher competence should do it. Even my technician knows how to intubate. When to do it, the dangers of it- all that doesn't matter to him. Can you share exactly which law? Searching it but could not find. This is disheartening, especially knowing it’s being promoted by the government itself. I have a couple questions: Can we ask the doctors qualifications before seeking appointment? Can the Hospital deny treatment or good treatment if we ask for the doctor’s qualifications? I understand the level of skills/knowledge an MBBS doctors need and have is miles above these other systems of medicine. Also, you guys spend a lot more on your education than these other folks so you do expect a certain level of compensation for your efforts. However, one has to admit that the system is broken and healthcare coverage is pathetic in our country and the only stakeholders in this who have some level of credibility in the medical community themselves who need to make the system scale by creating a Tier based system of healthcare skills. The current system of MBBS or nothing is not working out for anyone. >He has one magical cure for all ailments that is \"stop meat, stop carbs, eat natural fruits, eat less\". Sounds like every second uncle/aunty I meet in North India. That doesn't even make any sense. Homeopathy is not a medicine it's just Placebo effect. Profit motive isn't the cause of this. It's government interference. If anything, profit motive can remedy this if consumers decide they don't like this change. Vote with your money. MBBS= the first degree. A generalist. Can be trained to a high level, so an experienced MBBS guy can be very good at what he does. graduate degree~5 years. MD/MS/ DNB - 3 years post grad degree. Specialisation occurs here. Like general surgery, internal medicine, Anesthesiology, dermatology. MCh/ Dm- super specialisation degree. When in doubt, get clarified by an established MBBS doctor, or use Google. Would you be comfortable knowing that the medical officer handling your relative in the ICU at night(God forbid) is not properly trained in modern medicine but is having an experience based crash course in it? And he/she is there just because the hospital you admitted your relative to wants to pocket more money than if it were to keep MBBS MOs. You'll be paying the same bill regardless but you'll be getting a certain inferior level of service as compared to what you expect after paying through your nose. The discussion is not about MBBS or nothing. Its about alternative medicine practitioners practicing modern medicine without proper knowledge about them, their potential risks and what to do in case some adverse reaction were to appear. Oh, and to point it out. If a patient were to die because these BAMS graduates couldn't figure out what happened in the course of hospitalisation, you wont know if it was lack of knowledge or just carelessness Bro kojilaban hospital owner posts antivax shit There is no proof that it works. It is like my mother claims she has seen ghosts when she was a kid. Noted, thank you. I know just MBBS degree. I am confused between all those specialization and stuff. How to identify if medicines given by doctor are homeopathy or not? Lets say I saw few medicines bought by parents in house. I want to know if they are homeopathy or not. I thought homeopathy medicines are without packing. Correct me Man you hit the nail on the head. These guys truly want a (comparatively okayish) Indian medical system to work for the common people. I'm an MBBS intern and with how things are going my future looks bleak... Things like this make me want to leave India for any country that has more respect for the education. I don't have the money to set up a private practice either. Setting up private practice also takes a lot of money. Be it getting the land sanctioned or getting construction done and then registration of the hospital/clinic.. the corruption at each level is rampant. Or I'll stick to government college hospitals. In either ways i won't feel like it would be a good return for the work I'll have to put into the degrees... Just like the various Babas have followers. Quack is a more accurate descriptor for all of them. I'll be a hypocrite if I say that had I been a doctor, I would have preferred working in a backwards village. It is a very hard life, but nonetheless, a choice. My humble submission is that India's medical system needs to be fixed & the medical community needs to stop targeting alternative system medics for these problems and focus on the actual reasons. They are a symptom rather than the core issue. Not everyone with an MBBS degree should be a doctor and many alternative medicine doctors should have got the chance to study & practice modern medicine rather than opt for an 'alternative' system which was the only option left for them to pursue their passion. Profiting off the sick is the endeavor of ghouls. You are NOT a doctor if you are a Ayurveda or Homeopathkc \"doctor\". Unless you have done an actual degree in PROPER MEDICINE (MBBS) you should be ashamed of yourself to even add the \"Dr\" to your name. In any western country conducting yourself like this will land you in jail. Anyone that wants to fight me on this... BRING IT.... people's lives are at risk and your coming to them with your nonsense fake rubbish. >He has done mbbs, md etc(idk all), then he practised in uttarakhand for a few years until he came back, and started doing ayurveda training, got a degree in it,and now practises naturopathy This sounds very suspicious. If I assume that you're not lying, then that person has taken you for a ride. Why would someone who worked hard for MBBS+MD while paying loads of money for it, go after naturopathy after that?? Lmao. Do you even know how much dedication these courses require. That's like saying that a CEO of a large organisation who has worked hard all his life to be in the position that he is, abandons it all and takes up a peon job. This guy's story sound fishy af. Anyway, ayurved and homeopathy have not proven to cure anything by a proper peer reviewed process. On the contrary, they often prove to be harmful rather than helpful. So when compared to modern medicine doctor, these hakims and vaidyas will always remain quacks. If you like poor quality healthcare, go to a govt hospital. Now even private is ruined thanks to cronyism and poor policies. Healthy competition in a free market is what we need but we won't ever get it. We are talking about emergencies involving ICUs not your weekly colds Don't tell me you call 911 in case of an emergency. Checking qualifications is the only way. Granted it’s harder to keep track when it’s patients admitted in ICUs and wards. People and their attendants still definitely need to ask, especially in private centres where they’re charged as per doctor interaction. In some shady places is billed under the few MBBS doctors on the floor even if the actual examination was done by a BAMS/BHMS. >This is just a demand-supply issue. India creates very few MBBS doctors per year so someone has to pick up the slack. Your high salaries are only justified by the fact that there are fewer of you in number. So much misinformation and bullshit you’re spewing. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that on average, there is one doctor for every 1000 individuals worldwide, although this ratio may vary substantially across regions and nations. The so called “high salary” earned by physicians is due to the extensive and costly education and training required to become a doctor, which necessitates substantial talent and commitment. It is important to note, however, that corporate hospitals do not typically offer high salaries to physicians; an MBBS graduate can anticipate earning roughly 60,000 rupees, while a super specialist such as a cardiologist might earn roughly 1.5 lakh rupees. The exorbitant fees charged by corporate hospitals are frequently directed to the management's coffers >It's not like we have a situation where a large number of doctors in India are competing among themselves to serve in rural areas or in night shifts. Most refuse to serve outside the comfort of cities and the rest pack up their bags and leave the country asap after they graduate. Upon completing their MBBS degree, students are required to complete a minimum of one year of mandatory rural service, with the duration of the service varying depending on the state. However, the lack of adequate infrastructure in rural hospitals has become a significant issue. Surgeons and cardiologists, for example, are unable to offer their services in such environments without appropriate equipment and support. Even primary health centers (PHCs) may lack basic medical supplies like suture materials for emergency situations. Therefore, the government must be held accountable for failing to improve the infrastructure of rural hospitals, making it difficult for physicians to provide the necessary care to patients. You know what, you’re free to get treatment from these quacks. Good luck. Thats a bit controversial. Having been worked with these systems for a while, i dont think they have cognitive capabilities as close to a competent junior doctor. He’s a bitter little shit, don’t try to reason with him. Let him get all his treatments from these quacks. Most doctors are planning to leave the country, we are being underpaid and overworked here. 18 hour shifts and no absolutely no family life and getting paid so low while the management is making so much money off of us is just bullshit. In other countries we get better pay, better infrastructure and most importantly better work hours. If our country can’t get its shit together then our healthcare system in the next few years will be filled with quacks. Who’s going to end up suffering because of that, that’s what people should be wondering. I understand that it is controversial comment. I request you to register to chatgpt, upgrade to get access to gpt-4. Then ask medical questions. Lol, doctors are not looting common man. These corporate hospitals are, they charge fees in lakhs and get you treated by quacks without you even realising it. The doctors fees is significantly less in their clinics or small hospitals owned by doctors when compared to the big corporates like Apollo. The difference is like the cost of a cup of coffee at your local coffee shop and Starbucks. Of course. But my question was why are people calling them quacks? And given the downvotes I've received, it seems they really believe that. On what basis? Ayurved has been used for centuries. And Homeopathy came into existence in order to combat the expensive treatment provided by modern medicine. Neither of them can be all bogus, so why the hate? They're based on some form of logic and rationale. Why? This affects the common man way more than it affects the doctors. The doctors can easily leave the country for better salary and better work hours. Can the common man leave the country for better treatment? You pay all that money to a big corporate hospital expecting top of the line treatment but you end up getting treated by a quack. So who’s the real loser here? ![gif](giphy|3CU5tmCJy8zMoN3mMD) Wtf, isn't there any regulation for this? How can a hospital hire a resident of another branch? Daily exercise, regular nutrition and yoga made me mitigate smoking effects. Did not help me against covid whatsover though. Nor can help with cancer. Thats the difference, Ayush crap is just living the usual healthy lifestyle and putting a pointless overpriced tag on it because the people here can't even do the bare minimum healthy things so AYUSH is a \"cure\" First of all let's acknowledge the immense contributions of Ayurveda to the world of modern medicine as we have it today. Ayurveda, for it's time, was light years ahead of other medical treatment because it was the first medical system to methodically analyse treatment methods for different ailments using different decoctions extracted from natural resources. In effect Ayurveda and Indian physicians at that time laid the first foundations of modern medical treatment. And then the typical EXPONENTIAL scientific growth took over and now we have modern medicine. Modern medicine today is simply way ahead of Ayurveda and the quicker people realize that the better. Please spread this awareness in twitter as well. I for now shall always question my doctor about his qualifications before treatment. Our country’s laws are ridiculous and unregulated. Iatrogenic - induced unintentionally by a physician or surgeon or by medical treatment or diagnostic procedures. The best way to reduce these iatrogenic, sometimes devastating, events is communication and education. —Ncbi Rofl, Discover Magazine, 12 June 2012 [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/iatrogenic). Just medicine. Rest all are sketchy supplements and daily nutrition encapsulated as some helth product Fuck man, this country’s future seems so bleek. >These quacks then go on to prescribe medications without any training in modern medicine, including pharmacology, drug interactions, and contraindications. They simply prescribe medications based on** memorized treatment protocols for specific complaints** without knowledge of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drugs or differential diagnoses for the patient's complains. Are you sure real doctors are also not doing this? How to find if a private hospital has Ayurvedic or Homeopathic doctors in ICUs? Pretty much why all major foreign nations overnight made things difficult for Indian doctors in equivalency, because our govt began layering in snakeoil salesmen. Many of them also issued advisory to no longer go to India for medical tourism. All this after Indian medical degrees were increasingly being recognised near par to foreign equivalents in the last two decades. Several had relaxed equivalency. 1 step slow climb, then tumble down 10steps in a blink of an eye. This is expected in a system that rulers have 5years not to rule but to layer in their cronies. There are no MBBS doctors near me. I have to go to BAMS doctors for treatment. You mean they do not have any formal training? thats a lot of bullshit. There were several traditional form of medicines developed in different regions, and ayurveda was just one among them. yes and hopefuly the ayurvedic and homeopathic quacks will reduce the number of dickheads like tou through their stupid treatment . tell some merits of ayurveda?? you will recover from most common headcahes, sinus issues even without any treatment. ayurveda will kill ignorants like you homeopathy is just alcohol. because they are quacks, they are as scientific as the flying monkeys in religious textbooks。 Go to him for shit you have in your life. Asthma can't be treated it's an auto immune disease where in your immune system produces antibody against Rcs you are saying he just shut off a part of naturally all time occuring procedure? I guess they may treat stupidity next why don't you check for that too. They have been sliding in steroids for a long time now it is quackery BAMS is unscientific. just because our stupid government allows them to precribe meds and moreover still allow such unscientific stupidity being taught in this country doesn't make them doctors. I beg to differ. It's based on some form of logic and works. When it comes to medicine, a person is more concerned with the results rather than the theory of it. That's a very vague and untrue statement. This is wrong on so many levels. Lives are at risk here. They haven't studied allopathic medication. It's like a layman reading web md to prescribe medicines Don't know man. With all the unnecessary downvotes, it seems u can't even propose your ideas here nowadays . But that's what the government has promoted in its effort to align alternative medicines in the country. So why blame hospitals when regulations are relaxed by the government and hospitals are nudged by the government. We should know where the blame lies. They don't make up the bulk of the course. There are 19 subjects in MBBS. And toxicology is just a small part of Forensic medicine. Ayush pathology differs considerably from Modern medicine pathology. Compare Ayurveda Pathology textbook with Robin's Pathology. Anatomy is superficially similar but doesn't go in depth. And physiology is just PUC level for Ayurveda folks. Anatomy and physiology along with Biochemistry (which ayurveda folk don't have) are just first year courses. Pathology is second year along with Microbiology, pharmacology and forensic medicine. These are just foundation courses, then we have pre clinicals and clinicals followed by one year of internship and one year of rural service. You still think these quacks without going through any of the above training’s are as qualified as actual doctors? If so, then you probably also belive that your local bus driver can fly planes. You are just talking out of your ass. Okay but wtf is \"quacks\" Are you a teenager? Asthma gets better on its own by adolescence. And can come back by adulthood. My asthma was \"cured\" by puberty and came back when I turned 20 or so. If I had taken Ayurveda at that time, I would be saying that the drug cured it What were that doctor's qualifications? Placebopathy > Ayurveda, for its time, was light years ahead of OTHER medical treatments... Did I say Ayurveda was the only one? Like i just told you, BAMS students are taught anatomy, physiology, modern pharmacology and medicine, in addition to ayurvedic medicine. The need is not to exclude them out, but to be inclusive. Provide them the necessary training so that they can practice this knowledge correctly. Also, ayurveda isnt intrinsically 'unscientific'. It is lacking contemporary research, which is what makes it unscientific > stop carbs, eat natural fruits wat fruits are full of carbs lmao Welcome to Capitalism! I have been already reduce to disabled person by a bunch of allopathic doctors who cut two of my organs called tonsils in my childhood . Now like an dickhead you will say to tonsil are useless organ no dickhead they play crucial role in digestion that is why 60 percent of the IBS patient had tonscilectomy as a child and that causes chronic fatigue. I never had any problem with my tonsils but doctor fooled my rich parents to make me undergo tonscilectomy. I like this. Quack fight! It's what your government wants I never said that I support these alternative system medics working in modern hospitals & critical positions like ICUs and Trauma care. Especially if they try to portray themselves as MBBS doctors. What I'm saying is that this problem has been created by the Indian medical community themselves by restricting the supply of MBBS doctors in the Indian market. They wouldn't have studied alternative medicine if they had been given the chance to study MBBS. I don't think bulk of these people study Ayurveda or Homeo by choice. It's the only option available for them to follow their passion. Something else that deserves more light: [Health policy soon with mix of AYUSH, modern medicine](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/health-policy-soon-with-mix-of-ayush-modern-medicine/articleshow/99222943.cms) /u/Time-Profession6258 Wait till you see this. [Health policy soon with mix of AYUSH, modern medicine](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/health-policy-soon-with-mix-of-ayush-modern-medicine/articleshow/99222943.cms) You do know what the U in AYUSH stands for? Also where the H comes from? Yes Why would I be bitter lol? I'm not even remotely associated with healthcare. If you would stop being a whiny little bitch and read my comment correctly you'll get the point I was trying to make. Take it as an outsiders perspective. Do IT engineers work 18 hour shifts or get worked to death by their employers like Indian doctors? No. Why? Because there is an unrestricted supply of IT engineers in the Indian market who can be rotated in 3 shifts efficiently 24x7. Even though in their earlier days they get paid less than an MBBS doctor, they have a good quality of life. [Health policy soon with mix of AYUSH, modern medicine](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/health-policy-soon-with-mix-of-ayush-modern-medicine/articleshow/99222943.cms) I wanna be like you. Stop blaming doctors or hospitals. This is the fault of the government. [Health policy soon with mix of AYUSH, modern medicine](https://m.economictimes.com/industry/banking/finance/insure/health-policy-soon-with-mix-of-ayush-modern-medicine/articleshow/99222943.cms) Read my comment again and try to comprehend my point. I thought you doctors were supposed to be smart. You gave me the WHO's recommended Patient-Doctor ratio. Do you know what's the ratio here in India? And no I'm not getting any treatment done by quacks. ChatGPT? Downvotes are for disagreeing, i don't see why they are unnecessary. And why do they matter for you to propose your ideas? You're free to share. People are free to disagree, and thus, downvote. It would be another thing if you got banned for sharing your idea. Shouldn't you have made that clear in your comment as the post is criticising non-MBBS medical practitioners? I'll speak for myself. Science is the most important thing for me. Until science doesn't back up all of the \"logic and rationale\", I can't really put my trust in it. What...? So when this “modern” medicine gets outdated, doctors js cease to exist? When this hypothetical scenario with near zero chance of happening, actually happens, then no, it gets replaced with something else. BTW, when physics gets outdated, ISRO will have to abandon all its satellites. Honestly, I'd be the same if I'd not been born in a city where Homeopathy is quite popular. It's just that I don't like people disrespecting those who're helping others. It's about the type of data you feed them. I read a report a couple of years ago about some AI being able to interpret X-Rays better than doctors. It's already happening. Thank you for the post OP, it’s informative. Can we just be more inclusive? It's hard enough to filter through these options and research about whom to consult for our complaint. Asking to say/use correct terminology makes it even more difficult. Doctors won't expect us to use medical Greek names to explain our problem. Similarly, we shouldn't be expected to stress over the terminology here > These things can easily be **overseen** as we trust the centre itself. You probably meant \"overlooked\". Why would you expect anything less from india OMG what is wrong with these people Thank you for the compliment. If ChatGPT was writing this I'm pretty sure it would be a lot more smarter! Doctors see dentists as second class citizens even when though entire day might be made of prescribing dolo to 50 people after seeing them for 30 seconds. Can a non-railway or non-military people visit these hospitals? If you want to hear dark truth about hospitals read till the end. I'm not a youtuber and I'm not gonna make any money if you read till the end. It's for your own good. Do read During COVID times, clubhouse app was on its peak. And I was in one of the room, full of doctors and professionals. The topic of the room was to share the secrets or rather dark secrets of your profession. So there was this Delhi based female doctor. She revealed that, if the staff is aware that this patient has mediclaim or cashless with him or his bill is gonna be paid by his office. They will first of all try their best to get the patient admitted in the hospital even if he could have been treated by prescribing medicines. once their point number one is fulfilled, they will bombard the patient with the tests,mri, CT 'SCAM' and what not which is not necessary at all. That is still understood. But here comes the truth bomb she almost sounded like she was in tears while revealing this, There are even cases where in the patient does not require the operation at all it can be treated just with some medicines, dietary changes and injections maybe. She once shared a incident when she newly joined where in the patient was really poor and he couldn't afford this operation and hospital was adamant on it, So she gave a small chit to that patients relative to meet her in the parking and asked them to meet her in her friends clinic later on. That patient didnt require absolutely no operation. Now another part, if you want to hear more. In most of the cases if the patient dies by hospital staffs negligence or anything for that master they will always mention cardiac arrest. Because it is really intracable and if at all you as a patient or their relative have such doubt you should ask for hospital timing record sheet( idk the right term) Where they mojitor blood pressure every three hours and sugar etc If it is hospitals mistake they will never show you that. Edit : This is another day, more shocking fact. This is also during the lockdown, but it is not clubhouse this time it is Twitter rooms. There was this room run by standup comedian kajal shrinivasan. Ther was this young doctor who was working on a hospital since last 1 year or so. He was a bms. He revealed that when we pass from the college we are just blank and we have no idea what and how to treat the patients. We just experiment with the patients. In some cases patients show really severe side effects because this chaps prescribed wrong medicine. He said he even used google to recommend medicines Modern medicine won't get outdated because it will keep improving itself with newer discoveries and knowledg. No. Earlier Indian Railways used to allow non-railway patients to get treated by their doctors by paying very less fees set by the IR. This induced a lot of crowds in hospitals and the privilege of railway employees was lost because the general public preferred railway hospitals over any other hospital because of the quality of treatment offered. Hence, it is discontinued now and allows only railway beneficiaries. Point to be noted here : In case of emergency, ANYONE can visit the RAILWAY HOSPITAL. Once the condition of the patient stabilises, they will be transferred to a non-railway hospital. Indian Railways is always at the service of a common man. Finally non-medicos are realising this! This is all because the government has allowed them to use Dr. Which is an umbrella suffix. They can get these grads for half the price of mbbs and actually exploit them for night duties. Honestly a lot of them don't even know how to take cases because they have never done that. What a load of bullshit. How you can have medicine for novel virus? I strongly suspect that the diagnosis of typhoid is wrong. I don't understand if you are in support of my comment or critiquing it? Except for the liver disease from the medicines. That's not placebo. Well hospitals surely share some blame. Are you talking about private colleges because if someone clear neet with a good score they get a govt medical College without any donation This is fucked up. As a layperson, what do I ask the doctors to make sure they're qualified? Do I ask for their certifications? How would I know they're not fake? Ayurveda doctors are not the quacks😭 Modern medicine has same medicine for everyone and just treats the symptoms without addressing the root of the problem. Modern medicine is a Big wall street greed and you're better off without going to any of these big hospitals. I will give my 2 cents to this issue : I have finished MBBS and am about to finish my DNB in Medicine. The reason why private hospitals have these issues - our govt considers Ayurveda and homeopathy to be on par with MBBS. I struggled to get into MBBS and to pass. Foreign modern medicine graduates have to go through an excruciating exam to be eligible to practice in India. Meanwhile, becoming an ayurved or homeopath is ridiculously easy. And there are lots of these seats. The govt keeps pushing these branches up These corporate hospitals take advantage of this confusion - MBBS graduates get 50-60k at the start while AYUSH people get 20-30k. The hospitals admit patients under an MBBS + MD/DNB specialist consultant, but many of these consultants have spent 10+ years becoming a consultant and have been working for longer as a consultant. They are not interested in working overnight. As long as the patient is admitted under a proper consultant and a consultant takes rounds everyday, it is not illegal on the part of the hospital to keep Ayush \"doctors\" on call to do the boring work of writing drug orders, talking to relatives, making daily notes, checking pulse and BP etc. Most of these \"doctors\" will not do anything without calling up the consultant (even in the middle of the night) and asking for their advice. In very reputed hospitals, ayush people will not be in the ICU. They will do clerical work in the stable wards only. I am in a hospital that doesnt take AYUSH doctors by policy, but that does mean the hospital has to pay twice the amount to the Mbbs doctors they hire. Not many hospitals would be willing to do that. The solution is for the health ministry to make it clear that only MBBS doctors should be allowed to write drug orders prescribing modern medicine. AYUSH must not be allowed the privilege to prescribe modern antibiotics, sedating agents, steroids etc. But our govt will never do this. Pseudoscience is big in our govt I remember a patient had been transferred to us from some small hospital. He had mild covid and only needed home isolation for 5 days, instead a homeopath prescribed him high dose steroids thrice daily for 2 weeks. Poor guy ended up with mucormycosis at our hospital, had to have half his lung removed and barely survived. Yeah this is fucked up. Hope this gets much more attention Everybody does one story and the next day a big ad comes from the hospital. Issue dead. One story is nothing. It's a problem when stories appear and with a higher frequency. The reason is again the same - the govt encourages their recognition as a \"doctor\". The word doctor has no meaning now. Instead of being someone who practices modern medicine or has a doctorate in a scientific field, now the word is hijacked by those who want a chill life but make money and respect . Mbbs quacks in india bill 17 lakhs for maleria and confiscate dead body of child , and then they have audacity to say things about ayurvedic, i remember the fucking mbbs retards use to say pranayam is bad for health then when their dady WHO remaned it as impulsive breathing exercise it became science . Can confirm. American healthcare also recognizes quackery like Chiropractors. Its even gotten to the point where many insurance companies will try and push you onto them as it keeps initial costs low. Even if it fucks you up. Hilariously, physicians only took the title doctor because of the prestige the term carried. The original usage of the term is teacher, not someone who cures you. It is required by law for a doc to mention his state registration number. So hopefully better enforcement of that law , will help. I am studying mbbs right now and can say that dentists are doctors. They practice modern medicine , and in fact for a lot of cases involving the mouth and face they are better qualified to treat you than ent specialists . Dentist are definitely doctors . No , they do not have any training in modern medicine. They can prescribe parecetamol for fever as any other person can , but they can't really look out for danger signs , clues for it being a particular disease , and do not have enough knowledge to figure out disease etiology. The respondeat superior dictum of law states that the management will be held responsible. Atleast that's what they teach us in med college , that you will be responsible for the mistakes of your juniors. for neet ug medical fitness certificate i had to visit a dr. and get his sign and stamp for approving me mentally and physically fit, i went to the dr.s place to get his sign and stamp it was then i realised that he isn't a mbbs but his brother is and he uses his brother's name and gr no. to practice that guy himself is a homeopathy dr. but uses his mbbs dr.s name to practice this is highly concerning ... Afaik, Students studying BAMS and BHMS study Modern Medicine as well. There are doctors who do equally good work if not better then the MBBS ones. I think it boils down to the capacity of the doctor who is being recruited. I guess India can say goodbye to being a medical tourism destination very soon Your wrong even ayush docs learn all meds n phrma of mbbs and they are also given practice. If you want then to stop then ask all mbbs docs to start working they won't work and just blame others I'm a final year med student and nowhere have i read that tonsils affect digestion. Yes they have a minor role in immunity but that too heavily decreases with age. Would you be so kind as to send the papers/textbooks that you read this idea from? >Two, I'm not saying that Ayurved and Homeopathy are a valid alternative. We have a huge shortage of Doctors and medical personnel, these alt. Medical personnel have enough training to act as \"secondary caregivers\". Would you rather see your loved ones, unattended in ICU? What if the only option you have is a bus driver? These are corporate hospitals they have all the money in the world, no excuse for them to do this. It should be termed as allopathy only to distinguish it from natural medicines.Most of the industrial allopathic medicines say from pychiatric drugs have half baked science around them.Anti depressants and antipyschoyics from SSRIs to SSNIs from 1980s have been marketed on the basis of the infamous chemical imbalance theory or low serotonin theory which has never been proven.The tricyclic antidepressants are given on the assumption they cure depression by increasing serotonin in the brain but it has never been demonstrated that low serotonin has been the cause of depression and other mental health ailments.So without any basis in science the billion dollar pharma cartel of Pfizer, modern,GlaxoSmithKline,J and J ,Eli Lilly have been pumping out anti depressants and have made billion dollar business out of it.Based on what evidence?They just observed in clinical trials that people with depression had 10 percent more impromvents than placebo.How did the improvements happen ?no idea?What is the puchopharmacology of tricyclic antidepressants?Neither psychiatrists nor GPs have any idea.What long term effects these drugs have on the brain?no idea.So basically in tge name of science pyschiatry has sold pseudoscience and snake oil by manipulating science thanks to pharma cartel.So ya allopathy is allopathy it should be called industrial medicine.We are glad that Dr Joanna Moncrieff of University College London finally destroyed this low serotonin theory in her 2022 paper but thousands of people's lives ruined by heavy prescription of antidepressants without any science who will accept tge blame for prescribing this snake oil to people.Will industrial medicine or allopathy accept the blame for using pseudoscience and PR stunts? While working in practo, the statistics of listed doctors cane out to about 50% of doctors in india (from the sample of 2lakh that we had then) did not have a medical degree or registration for allopathy but practiced nonetheless. For a long time in our search results, we could not differentiate between say a real oncologist and an ayurveda quack who claims to treat cancer. The company waited for like 4 years after which the product managers decided to label the ayush ones (I think after a fatal incident and legal threat). When my dad got surgery for cancer, in HCG, I witnessed this myself - apart from the surgeon who was overseeing, his team was a bunch of BAMS grads who actually did the surgeries. It's like paying to be treated by IITians and instead receiving treatment from from a roadside ear wax cleaner. Our corporate hospitals are basically Infosys of the medicine world.

This is gonna hamper my generation’s future. Fuck this government. There was this minister in BJP who claimed that it cured her cancer. Total goober. How fucking delusional are you? A small exploration of your comments explains everything. Good day! Real doctors have to give tests without which they won’t be able to practice. These quacks would fail. Simple. What he’s saying is ayurveda was great and all and that there were many others too but that’s not the issue here. The issue is that certified quacks are treating patients which can be very dangerous. Bro, the papers you read were probably fake. This is not how they work. What kind of monopoly? It is the big hospitals that have a monopoly. Mbbs isn’t a business strat you idiot, it is a degree that allows you to treat patients. All these issues treat themselves. Your examples are fucking stupid. It worked. Modern medicine is way better. You can’t treat bigger problems with it. What ayurveda does ‘fix’ are small problems that don’t even need treatment. Is the education on par with mbbs? Are the exams as tough as mbbs? I don’t think so and therefore they can’t be treated as real doctors. What was the test done for typhoid? Was it widal test? It comes with s. Typhi, s. Paratyphi with titres and dilutions Jab kisi ki death ho jayegi tab bhi yehi bolega? Lol my comments is based on real facts ,IMA is most corrupt organization in india even more then IAS association etc , from illigally testing medicine on people to human organ trafficking everything is their business, even if a so called mordern doctor is involved in organ trade their license to practice is not revoked after 2yr they are found doing practice again , more people are killed by doctors then illness every year . I remember i use to get treated by a mordern doctor for thyroid for 5 yrs and my condition kept worsening, he recommended operation later i went to traditional med and now i dont even take meds ,fucking good traditional med just powder of some fruits vs some clinical chemicals, people diying next day after vaccine but its not due to vaccine is fucking joke . Imo, the only criteria for prefix like Dr. Should be emergency service. In emergency cases ,are dentist and physiotherapist qualified to treat casualties ? Ha ha because entire medical science is a stupidity, where they don't have treatment for anything, if u have live problem remove liver, remove kidney, remove prostate, remove eye lens, remove ear drum, remove knee cover there is no treatment. And look at latest research paper atleast 1 among millions are honest. Then cut tonsil of your entire family as they are useless. And then you will take digestive pills for 10 years soon too found that non of the digestive work more than two or three years and then you waste another three to four year to find another medicine that works for you and then again it stop working after two to three year. I think you are right please go ahead and cut tonsil of your entire family and feed them to dogs they will give you blessings and you will enjoy more wealth. First off, you need to calm down. I didn’t question your manhood. I understudy that you might have faced a lot of problems but I am not the reason. Secondly, do your own research on what tonsils do with actual research papers. They are associated with your immune system. There’s probably something else that is troubling you which you don’t know about. Rascal go to any doctor today in city like Delhi they charge 1000 rs for five minutes, who is running the business it's doctor only , there targets is how to earn more , even a mechanic working in workshop knows more than the mechanical engineer but just because mechanic doesn't have degree he is paid less and engineer who doesn't even know how to work or say even spanner is paid 100 times more . Doctor are useless piece of shit. 😂😂😂 another lolipop it was not consider good for anything 30 years back now they consider it is for immune system, you do your research, i only read research and do research myself, just go to library of your choice and read latest research on IBS published after 2020 . Dude, doctors spend ~10 years of their life studying. When normal folks start earning, they will have at least 5 more years of education. They deserve a higher pay but the pay depends on the kind of doctor. I pay my doctor 400-500 for a visit. He’s a post grad with at least 15 YOE. Is there anything in this country that is sacrosanct anymore? The current ruling party, through its own agenda and propoganda, has fucked whichever part of a person's life it could lay its hands own.. social fabric, law and order, education, medicine, not to forget politics (it used to be much classier), etc. I mean just the sheer money spent behind AYUSH program is insane to produce grads with degrees that are useless outside India. Just drives me nuts! >MBBS graduate would need to be paid more than 60k This is blatantly false. Very very few hospitals pay more than 30-40k for an MBBS graduate duty or ICU doctor. I’m an MBBS graduate and the maximum salary I was being offered anywhere was 30-35k **in a Metro city in India**. It might be even lower in tier 2 cities and smaller cities. I live in a state where the state government pays great stipends for internship and PG students- yet corporate hospitals are offering around 30k only for an MBBS graduate. I also did my MBBS from the best government medical college in the state. You need a post-graduate degree to make more money than that. The only reason why MBBS doctors don’t complain about this is that PG degrees are a must now, so the only people seeking out jobs on an MBBS degree are young doctors who didn’t get a PG seat right away, or those who just want a break before studying for PG entrances and want to occupy their time by gaining some experience or those doctors who finish MBBS and aim for residency/PG positions in other countries and need some work experience on their CV, or are preparing for exams and just want a job since it’s boring to study all day. I don’t know which city you live in, or which hospital is giving MBBS doctors 60k, but that is definitely not the norm in most of this country. A very prominent and famous corporate hospital I worked at gives only 30k to MBBS duty doctors and they have such a huge number of applications that they’re not even remotely requiring to rely on AYUSH graduates. The number of MBBS seats in this country right now is a little over 1 lakh and PG seats are just over 45000. This ratio has been around the same for several years now- there are so so many MBBS graduates who don’t get PG seats- there really isn’t a shortage of MBBS doctors in the market right now. Nurse Practitioners and Physicians assistants both have graduate level education. A nurse practitioner has a BS nursing degree plus a graduate degree. Physicians assistants have shortened version of medical doctor training by no residency. However they need to work under a doctor and don't do stuff like surgeries. Also the concept in not unique to US. Many other countries have it. I think as demographics get older, it will force countries to look how to train enough medical workers. So maybe doctors deal with difficult cases while NPs and PAs take care of the simpler issues. They still aren't Physicians and should have to disclose this when diagnosing patients. There's a whole subreddit about people whose treatment for sidetracked or changed when they shouldn't have been allowed to. r/noctor If there are no trained mbbs grads , yes they are better than laymen. A dentist is trained to take care of emergencies. Dentist can be oral and maxillofacial facial surgeons. They don't learn to treat, they mug to pass i have spend 30 years of life learning. Can you tell me why most of the doctor don't have hair are fat with huge belly big powerful lenses they are doctor they have degree they know everything than why they themselves suffer?? Because they don't know anything they are just muggers studying hard to pass. Haha, I've stopped believing in most of these doctors now. All they need is money, don't care even if the patient dies. Only one naturopathy doctor I've found that helps his patients selflessly. And it actually works for me to prevent most diseases. Wow, that's shocking, #cfbr Yeah but there are dedicated practitioners for that and they don't get involved into major hospitals claiming chiropractors can do heart surgery. Widal is the most non-specific test on the planet , but a favourite amongst the public for unknown reasons, lol. A positive widal titre does not make one typhoid positive. There could be multiple reasons - Living in a typhoid endemic area, past infections, other bacterial infections etc. Pls do not attempt to interpret tests on your own. Sadly civilians aren't allowed in military hospitals. Only immediate family members(parents, spouse and children) can be treated free of cost. I heard about this, even in public hospital they recruit them and keep them for OPD when they are short on the latter ones. Is t it a huge liability if caught ? Why would big hospitals risk such a thing ? Lol India. Congrats on destroying the blossoming medical tourism export industry. Not to mention Indian patient outcomes... Dad was in ACU in a decently big and famous hospital in Hyderabad. O2 dropped below 50 . The incharge doctor who is a BAMS homeopathic one did nothing. Monitor was beeping like hell . Dad was gasping for air and I literally had to run to OP to get the main doctor . He came and stabilized. I will never forget this in my life . Profiting off the sick is the endeavor of ghouls. Not sure if I made my point clear 15k-25k is where they start. For BAMS/BHMS with experience (5+ years) some corporate hospitals pay upto 80k. That’s the unofficial cap I’ve seen in these places. Management consultant would have done analysis and said - if Infosys and TCS can hire mechanical and civil engineers to write computer software, why not implement the same logic in hospitals ! Since govt is supporting all this, nothing can be done. Hopefully, as there is more awareness about this, some brands will come up with having \"only MBBS doctor\" and advertising the same. Wow what an eye opener, such genuine information makes up for most of the crap on social media PHYSIOTHERAPISTS ARE NOT DOCTOR FFS Fortunately my father is a Railway employee Your question is funny. Ever heard of words \"Profit / Gains\". That single world planted strongly on us / society can destroy whole EARTH. Classic example is destruction we ourselves bought on us from days of Industrial revolution to Today. @Time-Profession6258 I appreciate you taking time to write / explain what really is happening in corporate hospitals. Thank You. It's a damn good placebo effect then lmao From the limited amount of history, your mother mostly had some viral infection (fever, fatigue and body pain) although it may also occur in typhoid fever. Typhoid fever will also have other symptoms predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms like pain or constipation. At least for your mothers case the tests that were done were by you but it is common practice by GPs to do widal and give treatment for typhoid even though it’s not a reliable test. Moreover it’s results are considered only in the second week of infection. And it’s considered positive only above a significant titre of 1:160 whereas some labs give above 1:80 also as positive. So it’s very likely that your mother got some unnecessary antibiotics and the initial doctors assessment and treatment may have been right. Hard to say now though Yes ,being a medical student I am totally aware of it . All this quackery integration into some serious science based medicine and radicalisation in the name of preserving our culture by falsely patting our back that Ayurveda is much older than modern medicine won't change the fact that modern medicine is way more superior and preferred by everyone. Me and many of whom I know are planning to practice abroad after getting to know all this coz life is peaceful and smooth there . Appolo Delhi ? Which hospital doesn't hire ayush homeopath doctors ? Apollo Mumbai Are there any hospitals that don't use ayush homeopath doctors? Are there any hospitals that don't use ayush homeopath doctors? Max hospital? Do they assist in surgeries? Are there any other options besides gangaram in Delhi/NCR Which hospital doesn't have ayush homeopath doctors in Delhi NCR? Are jci accredited hospitals reliable? I am a physician (Medicine) and dont have first-hand experience in surgical issues. And my hospital does not hire AYUSH people. But having said that, I am sure they would not (or should not) be allowrd anywhere near any OT. But I have no idea if they are I don't even remember honestly Which hospital if you don't mind Are jci accredited hospitals reliable? Hinduja mumbai I don’t know, alas. The consultants in the fancy hospitals are excellent. You just have to be careful that nurses and junior doctors are giving the correct treatment, following correct protocols. Is there any hospital that doesn't use ayush homeopath quacks Is jci accreditation reliable? Wtf. This is so fucked up. Doesn't matter because legally they are right. As informed customers, we should proactively ask for MBBS doctors. In india this trend of hiding behind loopholes if on a rise. They perform surgeries? Is your dad okay Do they assist in surgeries? Thanks 🙂 The MBBS doctor is a glorified peon. Salaries in chennai don't cross 45k a month. if that mbbs guy doesn't get MD he is *Toast* Hey i did mbbs from china and I couldn’t pass FMGE despite attempting 3 times. They have zero transparency and the syllabus isn’t fixed. Can you please explain how your friend cleared BLE ?? I’d like to give the exam, please help me out here Sorry mate. I am no longer in touch with the friend I have mentioned. I do hope you receive the help you need and all the best. That nurse point is so accurate. When I was admitted, the nurse inserted cannula at a wrong angle which resulted in massive swelling and extreme pain. Finnally, after institing several times, they removed the cannula and put another one into the other arm. as a dentist, do you floss? Actually I do and somehow have developed a superiority complex over that :) 😂😂 good one there. If being a doctor is about a degree then they are real doctors. Right on point There are also plenty of patients who would get treated and escape from the hospital by force without paying the bill. Hiring a couple of gundas to break you free would be cheaper than paying the bill. This is extremely disheartening to hear. If there are more such cases that you are aware of, would you mind sharing for the common benefit of everyone. If people like sushruta or charaka were alive today, they would've used scientific data to keep updating the ayurvedic system to a scientifically accurate one. This would go on to the point where ayurveda and modern medicine would be the same. Damn I am a bams doctor and hearing us called as quack is overwhelming. Ayurveda is really misunderstood by people. Passed away, around 4 years back. Oh my god, thank you for this information! I’ve been really confused to see why all these BAMS doctors are working in a normal hospital with no drug knowledge as per their education. Surprisingly these are the doctors that try so hard on internet to post about their day and prove that they are also so called DOCTORS! But this is insane. Be safe guys always check if the doctor is qualified (MBBS, MD) and not BAMS."
