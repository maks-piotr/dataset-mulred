        "> Meta, in a report, has revealed that it identified and took down about 4,700 fake Chinese accounts that were set up to disrupt the 2024 elections in India and China. These accounts, pretending to be Americans and Indians, were spreading false information on divisive topics.\n\nWhat about the Indian elected representatives, including ministers spreading false information nationally, internationally, and officially?",
        "Dude either  you are infected with disease called 'WHATABOUTISM' or u r the same guy who opened these 4700 account !",
        "Well , one party thrives on apesement of minority and another on apesement of majority it's obvious bjp is going to win",

He/She is not saying anything against any community, just commenting on the general strategy of these two parties.",

AAP is BJP-lite when it comes to protecting minorities, Delhi's students, working class and both Muslims and Sikhs have learnt that over and over, even Christmas dinners at Delhi's churches were not spared by Bajrang Dal.         \nPeople are welcome to shoot themselves in their foot, I mean Yogi won in UP again after his covid handling - but that doesn't mean that Congress appeases the minority - they haven't even been in power for 10 years now.",
