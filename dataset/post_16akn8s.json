    "light_cleaned_selftext": "The reporter literally said \"Ladka ladki ek saath 3 din oyo mein rehte hain matlab jante hi honge ki kya hota hain aur police aayi hain kyonki log bohot ghusse mein hain\". I don't get why are people angry? and what's the purpose of shouting \"Jai shree Ram\" after handing over adults doing adult things which doesn't even register as any crime and showing them as some kind of criminals. Isn't mob harassing for no reason a crime?, isn't mentally and physically harassing someone for no reason a crime? and why are people following this idiot with towel on his shoulder and posing as if they did something to be proud of? So many questions about why someone's privacy can become others business and harass and still get away with it?. source : [https://youtu.be/HkcsSL5n9L8?si=7D2qM0XTKqadQEkS](https://youtu.be/HkcsSL5n9L8?si=7D2qM0XTKqadQEkS)",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "When everyone and the police of a place has the same mentality, what can you expect. Chutiyo ki Kami nhi desh mei sir Are you new to India? Moral policing and not minding our business is a part of our DNA. no matter how much indians show themselves as developed, still most of population of india is too conservative. regardless of religion of couple, if couple with same religion are found in hotel they would think that this is shameful for society and after capturing them they will feel that they are doing gods work so they feel proud by chanting gods name. &#x200B; if we want to develop as nation then we should aware people about others privacy and freedom to do whatever they want >Bittu Bajrangi Bittu bajrangi kab se ho gaya? Bittu to madarchod hai. This isn't mere moral policing, incel behaviour, and stuff like that. This is more systematic, involving informers, hindutva vigilantes, police/state encouragement, and media. Bittu Bajrangi, the idiot with towel, is a Bajrang Dal member. All this is the direct outcome of the post-2014 hindutva social media brainwashing that Modi runs to spread ideas like \"love jihad\" conspiracy. Those Hindus are angry because Modi has trained them to be angry. The JSR slogan was popularized by this ecosystem as a slogan of hindutva solidarity. They shout it because they've been convinced by Modi that they're protecting Hindu dharma. All this should be pointed out relentlessly because I constantly see that: 1) There are lots of urban educated Hindus here who try to whitewash the Modi govt's culpability behind such events. 2) There are lots of urban educated Hindus here who pretend to be liberal but are in fact closet bigots and their votes for BJP perpetuates the ecosystem above. Even hotels specify sometimes that they don't allow unmarried couples. That's such bs! Part of NDA Just the beginning pangs of a theocracy. I sometimes wish the British Empire never left. Seconded. For all its shortcomings, it kept troglodytes like these in their place. Anti National statement. Jesus fucking Christ Police ne baad mein kya Kiya uska toh kuch nahi keh sakte par accha kiya le gaye inko atleast yahan se Bach Gaye bheed ke beech mein. Warna agar ek Banda pitne lagta toh sare lagte. Reporter bhi aise hi ban jate hai kuch bhi bol raha hai matlab kuch bhi, sirf masala lagane ke liye khabar mein Moral of the story - don‚Äôt stay in cheap OYO hotels. Privacy is expensive and reserved only those who can afford it. The rest have to suffer like this ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bhudde ko sex nahi milta to dossre ko bhi nahi krne dega. Basically jealous people don't want anyone else to have fun in life. Losers. Atal bihari Vajpayee ne ek interview mein kaha tha - ‚Äúmain kunwara hun, bhram chaari nahi‚Äù These guys are fools All those protesting never got laid until after 30.. that‚Äôs why they are jealous if someone gets Can't we file a case to High Court and sue everyone involved, for false accusation and invasion of privacy etc.? My parents say the same. The fact is : 1) Police can trump up charges and there is zero accountability. 2) The court cases are delayed like anything in this country and might even take decades At this point, it doesn't even matter what you have as an IPC etc. And people still spew bullsh!t like \"why is everyone going abroad\" like how about you change your mentality first? > I don't get why are people angry? because they know they are not getting any, its just jealously > purpose of shouting \"Jai shree Ram\" just trying to legitimize/saffron-wash things they know are illegal, and their idealogues will say it is because of muslim invaders than indian women have to be protected Honestly they'd kinda do the same if a British women was sleeping with an Indian man. We need more of our educated people working for the country, but given how the country is, most of the capable and educated people end up leaving the country. Just a bunch of bastards creating scene cause they cant have fun and doing what they can to boost their egoes in the name of religion. Wish there was some law where victims of such harassment can file case on those who harrased them without any illegal activity involved. Maybe law experts can enlighten. I know going against a mob is insane, but someone needs to do it ‚úåüèΩ Vote for BJP in 2024. So, Bajrang Dal can dictate what you do in your bedroom. /S I dont have an answer to the whys of your post but there is no logical explanation to it and it is our reality now Part of BCCI I was thinking this was some new incel shit. Then I saw the video. It's common \"sanatan ki raksha karo\" hysteria. Nothing new here Maybe the girl is below 18, that can be a reason for police interference Part of cbse If someone would have invaded my privacy like that, I would surely be either in jail or beaten to death by now........for murder of the invader People not getting any action are jealous of people getting any action. Soon...BCCB ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah because it is near impossible to live in this country when you're actually educated. I don't plan to get married due to variety of reasons and I bar handful of cities and that too very particular areas in those cities, it will be impossible for me to live with my partner in the same place. This is same for every aspect of life. Contrary to their claims India is not inclusive or tolerant at all. Any action that deviates from the norms of the society is violently retaliated against and that is legitimized by the state. When the choice is between living under consant threat of violence and going abroad, everyone who can do that will do that. Yes, I remember how fondly our society looked at unmarried people having sex before 2014. You had me in the first half. Most of our population is like this it will take another decade. BTW it is a nice idea. There are places where it is difficult to get rentals for single or unmarried couples. As a Lawyer, yes you can. But it's best to stay away from the courts. Inserts Tarik pe Tarik gif The land of the Kama Sutra can't see young people having fun Username checks out What would‚Äôve happened if Muslim girl and Hindu guy were similarly exposed in Kashmir Snarky strawman opinions like this that trivialize the impact of Modi's mischief on society is how he ends up winning 37-53% of votes. That's why I took the time to write that comment to point the finger explicitly instead of remaining silent assuming everyone already understands it. For the benefit of others, the strawman in this fellow's snark is this: I never said Indian society was not conservative about sexual policing before 2014. What's difference since 2014 are: the scale of the informers network, the involvement of hindutva vigilantes, the popularity of the love jihad conspiracy in Hindu civil society, the state support for vigilantes from police and judiciary, the JSR shouting that explicitly connects sexual policing to the hindutva religious sentiments. ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á , ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á!!

Bhaiyon Behnoo... Ye desh chunotion se nhi, chutiyon se pareshan hai. Mitrooon...., I feel personally attacked!!! See you on the morning walk. Crime is that the police needs to be paid.

Mudi ji hain, to Yeh mumkin nahi hai! Jai Sri Ram as become the incel anthem of Bharat. And now we are exporting our premium quality chu*yias all over the Globe! \"In a honest society the corrupt, and in a CORRUPT society, the HONEST, must beg apology for existence.\" Humari wali oyo nahi gyi toh tumhari wali bhi nahi Jani chahiye part of icse Barbaad gulistan karne ko sirf ek hi ullu kaafi hai yahan har shaakh pe ullu baithe hain anjaam-e-gulistan kya hoga This will make couples do \"Luka Chhupi\" u know Khajuraho Temple ?? üá¨üáß Absolutely agree. In a 5star hotel one can have a 3some with a monkey and giraffe and nobody would bat an eyelid. Kyun ki apna bittu pehelwan wahan pe ghus hi nahi paayega. In any case ensure that monkey and giraffe have given consent. We are civilised people. Chunotiyo sy nahi chutiyo sy bhara hai yeh ye desh! They are creating their own employment at this point. The country votes for irrational idiots. The country expects rational behaviour from the lawmakers. How is it possible sir? Bhai isiliye forest hi me kaam tamam kr liya kro I know these peoples are becoming conservative in the name of Hinduism but Hinduism is far more open about these issues than any western countries. It's just that no one wants to waste their time reading this scripture rather they believe what the middle man of religion is telling them. Nothing pisses off an Indian incel more than somebody getting some. Crabs in a bucket. Your comment was supposed to say, \"part of the state syllabus\". ... Don't tell him. What can be do part of jee mains We mind your business when their is crime or injustice going on else we always poop your nose Remember the murder in Delhi where people were walk in front of murder, as if they are walking in a garden, who was killing the girl no one dared to stop that MF Park me couple sath baith Jaye to adhe uncle anties ki g**d jalne lgti h aise dekhte h maho crime kre h hum State is the reflection of its people Also they get a solid chance to ask bribe This is the reason why many people want to left this shitshow, we deserve better quality of life. Aise to thodi 140Cr bn gye part of upsc Ahh the usual fucked up judiciary system of India. Ahh yeah everyone is telling me that. It's so annoying how it's literally against the law yet the dumbass judiciary of India basically gives a huge middle finger. > Faridabad Say no more.. completely understandable news given the location. Ridiculous. People need to understand jurisdiction of the law. same people who turn their news off when its about domestic sexual abuse They are jealous that they aren't the ones getting laid! Yeah ik, I'm planning on leaving too when circumstances permit. I've seen some hotels and resorts that say \"couples welcome\". Found that weird to mention,but now it makes sense üòÇüòÇüòÇ getting a giraffe in to the bedroom will be tough I guess....they don't have any ID proof...

INDIA If you get caught in this situation don't do anything you don't have to fear if you both are not minor. Most of the time police use our fear , especially female . Sit shamelessly most of the time they release couples. It's funny how these same people go home to jerk off to porn or ignore someone getting harrassed/murdered on the streets in broad daylight. \"bUt mUh sAnSkAaRz, mUh gReAt iNdiAn vALuEz!!!!\" if you plus one more star ‚≠ê .. if lucky might as well get out film actress ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bharat Matha Ki Jai Govt run by gundas for the gundas . Govt is the biggest employer of these unemployed goons But the choice to understand is continuously available for anyone. One has choice and only choice matters! Who the bell chose the gov after all? It all depends in correct chunav Because people are still living a thousand years back when having sex without marriage was a tabboo. Don‚Äôt ask me why our society is like that, I don‚Äôt have an answer üòÇ Hosting G20 to showcase how much progressed India has done. And just <50kms from the capital, people are harassing random fellow citizens on staying together in a hotel room. You cannot change millions of people in a day .. One must be careful while doing these things in these areas They r angry coz they could not do it.. frustrated masturbaters .. bringing religion is trending politics..its new India.. we r time traveling.. going 100 yr back. Your DNA \"‡§Ö‡§≤‡§ó ‡§Ö‡§≤‡§ó ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ \" Piece of advice, try to keep it in your pants.. If you're gonna do it in an OYO, do it at a place which is remote but has quite a few OYOs nearby.. Ofcourse OYO's aren't safe, especially if you're doing in an area where people are highly conservative, location matters.. If someone starts harrassing you, pick-up your phone and start recording, people will usually back-off when they see a camera (but no guarantee, they might snatch your phone too) Know your rights, be assertive be aggressive.. Don't hunker down, the mob will hound you if they see signs of weakness. You might get a beating for being strong but this action will save your partner from the Harrasment.. Is it just me or does anyone else feels like People in India are significantly stupider than the rest of the world? There have been numerous cases of police raids and attack on couples before 2014. How does this argument address that? Part of INDIA Broken.... Please change... All those people who are against non married couples having sex are the people who don't get sex and are jealous of them. It's as simple as that. By not claiming there were no such raids or attacks before 2014. The scale, state support, religious justifications, civil society approval, media participation are what changed post 2014. I've explained them in a reply to another person elsewhere in this thread. Agar hum dono alag alag insaan se married ho to chalega kya? Asking for a friend that is india not haram like pakistan or sex slaver market But that's in severe need of change, don't think think? All these people have to be locked up, Property confiscated and compensated to these couple, whether they are married or unmarried. They only they will stop fingering in other people‚Äôs lives. Mfb Levi is a virgin, just like the above commentator ;) In India only when you are in your 40 you are considered as an adult. Till then you are treated as a kid Lol... Consensual sex is the crime to them. excuse you, it's BHARAT A decade? No Mate a decade would be required just to undo 25% of the damage that has been done to this country in the last 10 years. That too only if the bigots are kicked out of the chair first. hahaha. the some uncle aunty will turn a blind eye when their grandson will look at a woman dirty. Ladka h ho jaata h. Ye to par India(former Pakistan) nahi hai? r /Bharat alag sub reddit hoga jisse aap aye ho I mean to get the thing approved in court bro. The judiciary system is very slow, especially in supreme court. Makes me wonder why publicly flogging these MF goons naked with a red hot iron rod isn‚Äôt a valid option?!!! All you want to know why is given in the title. \"Girl and boy of 2 different religions\" what a crap show They are worried about girls. if the boy is from another religion than girl That's what they say they're worried about. What they're really worried about is others getting any action and they aren't. People are jobless. With nothing to do they run after people they think are happier and try to ruin their lives. Source? LOL Part of NDA BRB getting a PAN card for my giraffe Ah, Vajpayee... The gateway drug to Modi. Yesn't Yesn't Itne jobs ke baad bhi itna unemployment? Also link it with Aadhar while you are at it.. Unofficially employed payed in black, you know what I‚Äôm saying. > Unofficially employed *paid* in black, FTFY. Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in: * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.* * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out!
