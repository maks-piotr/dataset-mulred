    "selftext": "The recent successful WGA strikes in the US and the railway strikes in the UK really surprised me. I didn't know unions could have so much power in such textbook capitalist countries.   \nIndia too has many states where there is a communist government but you seldom hear about such unions or strikes.\n\nI found that the Global Rights Index has given a rating of 5 (No guarantee of rights) for trade unions in India ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_unions_in_India)) which got me wondering what exactly is the meaning of communism here? Is it not the same as the communism you read about elsewhere like in Cuba? It seems like everyone is extremely polarised about the matter. Pardon my ignorance I am only trying to understand the scenario here and not trying to offend anybody.",

        "These unions are led by some politician or someone will political affiliation in most cases. Indian communist are lapdogs. It started with Soviets pumping money during Indira's time. Their allegiance it to a foreign country, not to India. They're bunch of radical elements disguised as communists.",
        "Just a political party with a fancy brand culture copied from overseas, spearhead by upper caste babus. It was never implemented throughout the subcontinent. \nThere was a reason why Periyar and Ambedkar stayed away from Indian Communist party.",
        "Just Google \"union strike india\" and click on the \"news\" tab. There are strikes called everyday.\n\nBut there are many Unions that are not Communist. They organize and fight for specific things - pay hikes, better health, safety etc. \n\nCommunist would be some group that decides the workers have to run the factory or govt. \n\nThat is an easy story to sell to large groups that are being exploited. But it doesn't work out great in reality, for many reasons. Lack of skill, resources, knowledge, good leaders etc and ofcourse the powers that be, ie exploitative/dominating type of people, don't like handing away their power or diluting it, so they fight to hold on to that power by hook or crook.",
        ">what exactly is the meaning of communism here?\n\nQuestion is what stripe of \"communism\" are you talking about?\n\nIt seems like you are talking about labour rights. Labour rights predate the conception of communism. If you are talking about labour rights, then we are better than few capitalistic nations.\n\n>you seldom hear about such unions or strikes.\n\nIt was common in 1990s and 2000s. In the last decade a strike in Maruti plant in Manesar turned deadly and resulted in the casualties/killing of one or more of management cadre. Strikes rattled the Indian textile industry.  Capitalists found better textile producers in more amenable countries like Bangladesh where the owners could be unperturbed by labour concerns.\n \nAlso, people in India used to lap up the low pay and abysmal work conditions. They were not aware of the cabal of capital holders, nor were they literate enough to understand the social dynamics.\n\nThe present IT/finance/engineering crowd does not face strikes or is not empowered to call for a strike. So such news flow under their radar.",
        "It means communism in India is dead even in Kerala where they are in power.  And thankfully",
        "What do you think a bundh is? There are huge unions and strikes often across India (probably more so in the southern states).",
        "Lmao. There are more strikes in capitalist countries than supposed communist countries. Both china and soviet's banned unions.\n\nImo communist government bundles the power of industry and state. The end result is not dissimilar to corporatism. Separation of powers is in my opinion key for maintaining individual dignity.",
        "The workers in India are exploited to hell and back. But they're good at protesting. The Union sentiments in India are strong.\n\nHowever, though workers' rights are an integral part of communism, that's not all communism is. There is a lot of theory, study, and praxis that goes into understanding and implementing communism. \n\nIf you want to learn about communism in an Indian context, r/IndianLeft might be able to guide you to some good resources. Bhagat Singh's autobiography is also a good starting place.\n\nBut to understand what communism is, start with Marx's Communist manifesto and 'Principles of Communism' by Engels. The manifesto is a pamphlet that will give you some historical context, and the POC is a set of few questions about communism that will clear up any misunderstandings you have.",
        "In the Indian context, Communism never was relevant and never will be relevant. \n\nWe talk about the Naxalites being communists and maoist, but they simply are tribal rebels who were subjected to brutal oppression by the government and decided to rebel. They don't know who Mao is, they don't want communism. They want to live with dignity and respect",
        "I think you will find strikes that actually succeeded in india. I haven't read up on the UK railway strike, but the WGA strike is said to be detrimental for writers, and the demands will make availability of jobs lower.",

        "Socialism and then communism is a system in which the means of production are owned by the masses. So they get their rightful earnings. In order to actually bring socialism there needs to be class consciousness amongst the masses.\n\nSadly it only exists in the upper class, they know their interests and they will always help out a fellow upper class.\n\nUnfortunately India is divided in many places, class, caste, religion, region etc. There's no unity amongst the poorer sections.\n\nI beleive caste system is the biggest hurdle,  a poor Brahmin has more in common with a poor dalit than a rich Brahmin yet they won't side with their own class. Instead they'll feel superior about made up categories and live a miserable life while also making it bad for others.\n\n\nUnder socialism everyone would get free healthcare, education and housing. That would solve most of the problems in our society. It did for USSR and Cuba. The only problem they face is from external capitalist imperialist nations like USA who always attacks a socialist state. \n\nThey have imposed heavy sanctions on cuba and successfully destroyed the USSR. \n\n\nIn the end of the day, you must realise, our enemies are only the rich exploitative class who won't stop at anything to extract as much value and give back as little as possible.",
        "Recently, electricity workers went on strike despite ESMA being enforced, so I don't see where you are coming from. Other people have already given much better answers than I possibly could on what communism could mean, so I won't touch on that.",
        "Has anything ever been achieved from a bandh? We do a lot of them, but seem to achieve nothing.",
        "Most are useless but some have achieved their purpose. Most of the Bandhs are done by Trade Unions not common people, hence we rarely know.",

        "Periyar was never a communist.",

        "That's exactly what I said.",
        "Buddy you need to start reading Indian news papers as well. There is always some kind of Bandh or striker that happens. A lot of them are localised. Only few are given national attention. Also Unions in India are divided along party lines, so most of them are like henchmen of the party who just follow what party leaders say.",
        "If you dont hear about strikes in Kerala, then you dont read news enough is all i can say",
        "I would like to correct one minor technicality first. There is nothing inherently communist about strikes or unions. It is just about fighting the corporations so that the workers are afforded a fair compensation and safe working conditions. Obviously communists and socialists largely support unions because it increases labor power and unites the working class, which most of us come under, not to mention it's a just struggle to claw back some of the most basic worker rights.\n\nAs for communism in India, there are many parties that purport to be communist but in many cases they are arms of capital because we live in a capitalist world so their power to actually impact anti-capitalist change is miniscule, no matter what their personal beliefs are. Strikes like the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes happen all the time in India, however without any institutional backing from the state or central governments these strikes very rarely result in permanent changes. We would have to contend with the strong anti-communist sentiments within the populace, work towards working class solidarity and promote leaders sympathetic to the cause before we can even hope to achieve any major changes like the strikes in US have.",
        "Unions in India are so much more powerful than in USA or UK. Bandhs are one example of a strike. There's bus drivers strikes, auto driver strikes, bank employee strikes etc too",
        "Unions have been highjacked by right wingers. \nUnion leaders support BJP directly or indirectly.\n\nThere's a mass campaign against communists.\nCommunist party is dead.\n\nStill there are organizations that have integrity but even they don't have diversity. Highjacked by uppercates.\nThey are casteist, sexist, homophobic and still living in 1920s.",
        "By the way, the biggest labour union in i dia is BMS, and aligned to BJP. Second biggest, INTUC is affiliated to congress. Labour unions are not communists necessarily. Europe has some of tbe best unionised workers.",
        "So how do we know? Bandhs in 1980s Mumbai collapsed the textile mills. IT industry can't even see one single union. The number of trade unions is in decline continuously. Indian government passed industrial relations code in 2020 which capped membership of unions and took away collective bargaining power. I dont get why I am being downboted.",
        "Those are political bandhs only. For advertisement only. No real objectives.",
        "No in Bengal until few years ago, transport was the biggest union that had to be placated because their strike could put the entire machinery into a standstill, because transport. Those got less with private players entering the market. To answer OP's question, Democracy is not just a 5yearly excercise to answer a single MCQ question, being able to form protest groups any moment with capability to disrupt government functioning is integral to democracy, that it's not a communist thing. The fact that those level of protest gets delegitimised in this country is a sign of Democracy faltering.",
        "The trade union system in the late Soviet Union consisted of thirty unions organized by the occupational branch. Including about 732,000 locals and 135 million members in 1984, unions encompassed almost all Soviet employees with the exception of some 4 to 5 million kolkhozniks.",
        "Sad to know that. I know one IT employee union which was successful in getting few things.  \nHere - [http://fiteorg.in/](http://fiteorg.in/)  \nThey used to be quite active before, not sure if they are now.",
        "i beg to differ here; the first Naxalites were not adivasis, but rural land workers; convergence of fights came after; Naxalites actually had and still have intensive political formation, amongst other courses (alphabetisation, maths, basic medicine); and the whole base of their fight was that those who work the land should possess the fruits of their work",
        "The vast majority of bandhs in the last 20 years are done to showcase political power.",

        "USSR and Cuba solved a lot of problems for their citizens but also ended up being classic totalitarian states which ran on unsustainable economy. Pretty much every analysis blames USSR's demise on their own policies instead of USA's \"imperialism\". Moreover they were as imperialist as the US considering what they did in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.\n\nScandinavian countries, the UK, South Korea and Japan are much better examples of socialism. These countries built up their economies and then ventured on the socialist path which aligns with Marx's ideas. Unless we have the resources, there's no right reason to be communist or even socialist. It only breeds complacency and corruption which is our current state.
