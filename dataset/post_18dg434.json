    "url": "https://i.redd.it/wz0r9hpwf05c1.jpg",
    "selftext": "\nThis post is divided into pros & cons of Modi govt from 2014 to date.\n\nPros\n1) rapid growth & improvement in transport infrastructure.\n2) make in india initiative which enhanced the manufacturing capacity of india in some aspects & increased both domestic & foreign exports of various goods. The export sector has particularly improved.\n3) terrorist attacks on civilians declined considerably. Excluding J&K, the overall civilian safety from terrorist attacks is now far better.\n4) the no: of international companies & their investments increased.\n5) military has been modernised & equipped with better quality weapons & various other tools to some extent.\n\nCons\n1) various botched projects/policies such as demonetisation, GST, farmers' issues, manipur ethnic class issues, delhi/uttar pradesh communal violence & riots, aadhar card data leaks, wrestlers' issues, covid lockdown & vaccine policy & so on. Demonetisation was a fiasco. It was a ludicrous policy by govt. GST was bungled by govt to a huge extent.\n2) disdain for human rights.\n3) fundamentalism/bigotry & peddling of pseudoscience.\n\n4) controlled mass media (godi media)\nBjp/nda supporters & followers while defending godi media should understand that media was one of the paramount reasons for the defeat of congress/upa government. During the rule of congress/upa govts, media was far more independent & powerful. A lot of medias were against govt. They often criticised & trolled govt. They informed the general public about govt's various issues & faults from time to time. Some of the national medias were usually on their toes to chase & find out the govt's misdeeds. This was especially very evident during the UPA 2 govt. To put it in a nutshell, media was the 4th pillar of democracy during those days. But unfortunately, today that's no more the case.\n\n5) distraction of actual issues by diverting public attention to islamophobia/christianophobia/sikophobia & pakistan/china along with ever growing nationalism & jingoism to also deviate people from other relevant issues (to be not confused with patriotism which is the positive side).\n6) religion (hinduism) and various government policies/actions are mixed with each other.\n7) protection & garlanding of rapists & hate speech proponents.\n8) rampant crony capitalism and all level govt corruption (gautam adani & PM CARES fund are apt examples).\n9) complete lack of transparency in various govt accountability matters/incidents such as PM CARES fund.\n10) suppression of citizen participation in democratic processes like RTI & improper response given to their queries by RTI.\n11) inauguration of half-baked infrastructure projects. Many of these projects were & are incomplete with lack of property quality, safety & reliability at the time of their inauguration & thereafter.\n12) make in india project's vision was not fully realised. There were several issues with it in respect to quality & reliability of various products. The govt failed to extensively utilise its scope & further potential.\n\nAnother point worth noting is whataboutism & blame games that are some of the major tactics which are often used by BJP govt as a part of their strategy to conceal their faults, responsibility & accountability. Although they have been ruling India for nearly a decade now & had also ruled india in some other terms before 2014, but they still keep on blaming Congress/UPA for any issues & faults which is hypocrisy to the peak. But what they fail to understand or intentionally don't realise is that they were overwhelmingly elected to form govt by the majority of indians in 2014 to fix the issues & faults of Congress/UPA government terms. But it turned out that BJP govt is far more evil & corrupted to the core along with their communal hate & divisive politics.\n\nAnyway, these lists are by no means exhaustive.",

        "I specifically meant those terrorist attacks like the ones we commonly used to have pre-2014 in the form of mass terrorism.\n\n>I’d argue that the attacks on civilians have increased or at the very least stayed the same.\n\nYes. The extremist attacks have tremendously increased post 2014 expecially due to the influx of right-wing organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal & so on.\n\n\n>It’s just that these internal terrorists are called patriots or nationalists now. \n\nPls don't put patriots & nationalists together. They are way different from each other. Our country actually needs patriots instead of today's nationalists",

Propagate not just Hindu nationalism but indian nationalism which is not limited just to post independence but embrace ancient Indian glory.\n3. Hate mongers, spread hate openly and make stupid out of people or maybe the people make themselves stupid just to ignore their hate acts because they like pt 1 and 2 about them and Avoid any reason to vite them out.",

But what rapid growth or we talking here, The average annual growth under Supreme leader is lower than under previous government. Infrastructure is fine, they spend money but it's mostly by borrowing. Make in India is mediocre. Indian manufacturing share of GDP is still pretty much as before. Trade deficits especially against China is still very wide. If you add how these ass wipes have changed the moral fabric of the nation one has to wonder if Vikas is just a step brother pretending to be your brother and making grand promises on Raksha Bandhan",

        "My father says Modi seems very competent, not because that is his quality, but because his opposition is very incompetent. And I must say I agree.\n\nPutin purposefully cultivated an incompetent and useless opposition so people would always vote for him. Modi didn't have to take any such troubles. People vote for Modi because they distrust RG. Unfortunately thst is what our national politics has become, Modi vs Rahul.",
        "There are lot of claims over the internet, I'm just trying to know the authenticity by irl examples. \n\nAlso, haven't seen an instance where a bridge collapsed leading to 100+ casualties in a renowned city, which is under the rule of the same party for the last 25 years.",

        "1) India getting more foreign investors is natural, our economy opened in 92 and thr base was set by upa govt. I don't think bjp boosted fdi so much to give them credit.\n\n2) Military getting modernized, improving our arsenal Etc means nothing to a common citizen. All I can say is upa govt didn't let Chinese mfs to take a huge portion of our territory. After all the the Conway blast happened in modis time and abhinandan episode was very embarrassing for Indians in the world stage. I was feeling good about the surgical strike until Modi govt wanted to have an annual commemorative kinda thing for just killing a handful of jihadis...Congress won us wars against pak but they never took credits like Modi did.\n\n3) infrastructure is one good thing happening, I will give credit for this. Even the last vajpayee govt was excellent in this regard and Modi doing it efficiently. \n\n4) 100% electrification of railways and more toilets is truly a Modi achievement, let's not take this away from him but at the same time I feel railways is managed bad than ever before. These vande bharat is a good initiative but less general bogey, less sleeper class Etc is the main concern. Also the frequent railway accidents and still the railway minister being in power Etc only means railways is fcuked under bjp rule. Upa wasn't this bad also wasn't innovative either.\n\n5) make is bharat is a double edged sword,on one hand it promoted local business but with that policies the crony capitalists also got trade protections for their companies. We were only scammed by this scheme, remember the freedom phone for 500 rupees and I recently saw a review about made in India jio laptops which are just absolute scams run by the richest guy in Asia. I am not against economic protectionism, but if I have huawei then I'll protect the company but it is stupid to protect cheap ass fraud companies in India ( not all but most in tech are frauds).",
        "Modi vs Rahul is stupid. Rahul cannot be trusted to affect a run out if both batsmen collide, tangle, and lie stunned in the middle of the cricket pitch.\n\nThe scam foisted on the public is 'No Alternative' so everything Modi does is accepted. This is a PM who lies ( DeMo, PM Cares Funds) about money but is not taken to task.",
        "One important point that affects every common person and that people don't easily recognize is the governments handling of inflation. Inflation is essentially stealing from your savings. Every paisa you earned and saved 10 years ago is worth half a paisa now. Meanwhile extra liquidity in the market allow the rich to exponentially grow their wealth. That is why it is said inflation disproportionally affects the poor.",
        "For 2008, 1. We weren't as connected to the the western world as you think we were 2. Our NPAs were controlled 3.our demand wasn't artificially inflated. \nYou can't go wrong with such factors in hand",
        "No argument about that. But in elections , people want to know who will become PM/leader. A person with a strongman image/reputation is trusted to keep his flock in line while a person without such an aura is distrusted, people say how will he bring change, run the country if he can't control his party officials. \n\nRahul is not viewed as capable leader. What votes they get is from old time loyalists or because of strong state organisation/leaders. But state leaders don't matter much in national elections.\n\nAll other leaders in INDIA are limited to their respective strongholds. So no national narrative that can sufficiently unseat BJP. Also INC gets very complacent in between elections. After K'taka, they seem to think anti incumbency and freebie promises will win them the elections. We have seen how it went recently.",

When in post and power everything and everyone will surround you . The real game of power and leadership start when you lose power. Rahul is not in Power for 10yrs.",
        "All your pros are not completely true except the 1st one.",
        ">During the 2nd wave of covid, vaccines along with oxygen cylinders & other medical amenities' production & supply were very low in india. But government still exported so much of them to other countries as a PR stunt when our country was undergoing a massive crisis. The govt should have first ensured that the domestic needs are fulfilled at least to a very good extent before exporting simultaneously or they should have helped other countries later\n\nThe govt basically bungled a lot in covid policy",

        "Rahul and Co were in oiwer for 10 years beforr 2014. They had the opportunity to investigate and indict Modi for godhra riots. They had an opportunity to build a strong political network and grassroots connection using welfare schemes. Did they do it? Did they use their clout on the media? I'm not saying I like governments controlling media, but when you are in power, how incompetent must you be to allow the opposition (then BJP) to hijack media and narrative? Look where that has brought us now.\n\nCongress has just got a humiliating drubbing in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where they already were in power! Why did they lose, especially in Chhattisgarh? That tells miles about how politically effective INC is as a party. Also in MP they had a golden opportunity, but wasted it. \n\nMany people are fed up with Modi, ok. But why is bjp vote share still increasing, while congress is not? What does that tell about how people view RaGa and his team?\n\nGet out of your cocoon mate.",
        "The thing is, whenever you think about a national govt, you think of a leader and his party’s vision. \n\nRight now, bjp is thriving because of an absolute lack of sensible and strong opposition. Plus the level of exposed corruption (keyword - exposed) during upa 2 has given people ptsd. Modi and his govt are smart about it, in the way that they’ll never fumble a major scam expose like congress. Corruption as a whole is an integral part of indian govt since our inception. How do you think were the billionaires thriving even under govt controlled license raj of the 70s and the 80s. This is true even for developed country like the u.s where billionaires will always field their candidates to get rebates when the said person wins. It is not ideal, but unfortunate reality. \n\nThere is no opposition, there is no vision. Kejri could have filled this void perfectly by rising to national politics but he is too busy in clearing up delhi and punjab mishaps and his party is slowly but surely getting the image of hypocrites. Mamta will never have a presence out of Bengal. \n\nAnd Rahul is utterly incompetent and can never be the face of a winning congress. Even in the states they have won, it’s mostly because people were fed up of the other parties. (Winning by default, much like aap in punjab). \n\nCongress will time and again assure people of democracy within their own party but will neither accept nor refuse any claims that they aspire to put rahul at its helm. Man is just not fit to run this country.\n\nI’ve said this before and i’ll say it again, as long as a gandhi is at the top of congress food chain, only yes men and loyalists will be allowed to thrive. This is essentially degrading a national party (which i think bjp will face too if shah takes over from modi, that man will ensure that bjp is his own personal army lmao) \n\nAll these facts coupled with the development that people see around them and a sentiment of this govt being ‘scam less’ is what gives modi the edge to run again and win again.",

        "You just mentioned Negatives which you think are not because you have any facts and figures to back them up , how was demonetization and GST bad for the economy please back your comment with figuratives rather than what you think. We already have figures for the economic growth , let's back the cons with figures shall we ?. Also don't you think corruption has actually gone down at least from the top and middle level tiers of governance ?. BJP has an ideology and actually i agree that they are taking advantage of Hindu votes , but they do things which many Hindus have been longing for  many years. Maybe you do not see them as your aspirations cause you may not feel any discrimination as a Hindu as of now. But when you will actually deep dive in the constitution of India you will see that Hindus are actually the most discriminated ones, and the people with whom the politicians have been mostly unfair to. So an average rural hindu will always relate to the BJP no matter what you think , and highly educated ones too . Communal bigotry con against BJP is the biggest stupid argument one can make , because BJP has time and again shown that they can win votes of Christians too even in Christian majority states , even in Muslim majority seats so that's clear bullshit. Infrastructural development yes BJP does inaugurate unfinished infrastructure time and again , and I agree that it is just stupid to do so , but hey every party does that to keep in public light. And really blaming CONgress and the Gandhi's for the historic blunders they made in India's history , that is also a con ? How can that be a con ? Helding a party accountable for their past mistakes is the best thing BJP could do for India, as it would keep reminding both the Congress and the people of the mistakes done by CONgress. Which will force Congress to do better by chance if they come to power in the centre. People are not fools they remember everything. Media was more free at the time of CONgress I agree but is it free today for both of the parties , media polarisation is the biggest thing happening in India where CONgress loyalists are mostly accusing BJP of things that actually BJP has not done , where are the proofs of all the scams you mentioned against BJP ? . The opposition tried rafale , they had no proof that failed , they tried PM cares that failed , they tried IND vs China conflict tried to portray India lost land that failed , they tried Adani card paid hitjob through Soros and hindenburg that failed spectacularly recently US govt released a report saying Adani was accused falsely , remember all that opposition could speak of in recent months was either Adani , Ambani and nothing else ? , Then what came caste survey , opposition was trying to milik this thing like some surgical strike on the BJP that also failed . If you will see social media right now check how leftists congressi bigots are trying to paint the recent elections results as a north vs south victory where gaumutra drinking Hindi heartland are illiterate communal bigots and south is educated civilized , trying to divide People again to get votes . Whereas BJP has more lok sabha seats in the south than the COngress , at least 30 seats while CONgress having 29 . People have time and again shown that their mandate is with the BJP as of now. The thing is BJP is different Yojnas for the rural and poor India have reached deep into the villages of India whereas CONgres have completely lost the connection there , if you want to check how much better BJP has done in sanitation, cooperative businesses and housing in the rural India ,just check the figures of coverage of household and toilets before and after 2014. BJP has been the complete package for rural India , promised development delivered it , promises justice and delivers it in the form of various reforms and policies , and also is breaking the caste barrier through HIndutva while uniting Hindus votes under one umbrella. Don't be surprised if in future the caste system gets totally demolished in India.",

        ">ndian manufacturing share of GDP is still pretty much as before. Trade deficits especially against China is still very wide\n\nAnd that's totally ok, strictly from an economic point of view, when an economy expands beyond its horizon the imports to that country increase. For example - when foreign investors will increase - more production happens - hence more imports happen - hence the wider trade deficit. It is after the manufacturing sector is built at its foundation that we see a declining trade deficit. MAKE IN INDIA is mediocre, yes I agree with that statement. \nIndian manufacturing will take time to progress it isn't easy, quality improves after a few attempts. Nobody, EVEN CHINA didn't got it right on the first attempt, how'd you think Chinese products got the reputation of \"shoddy and cheap\". \nThere have been many economic changes AT THE FUNDAMENTAL level which will start to show benefits in a few years, like the ease of doing business is one, India moved up the ladder in the ease of doing business index due to fundamental changes by removing or reducing bureaucratic chokeholds.

        "I believe the question has some of the answers very well given. You do see an increase in number of manufacturing work coming into the country, thereby giving rise to ancillary industries. Slowly but steadily we are going good, though with quality issues, in the production space. I can compare it to my state which is a fuck all situation in Kerala. No business thrives there unless protected by government or owned by government. They have literally made it a commie state by all means. \nEase of doing business has improved. \nA lot of cons have crept it, but that's part of the propaganda machine. We had appeasement policy for so many years, so what's wrong with the opposite policy for some time. These are qualitative issues which do not disrupt a political power in the country. When a lot of people or majority are angry, like here in Canada, then you have a revolutionary discussion disdain in the public. Life is still on in India, except for those who are now in the side against BJP. If you ignore politics and you live life as you fit deem, then you are great and happy. It's when you involve a party for India instead of India as a whole, that's when problem starts happening. \nWhat problems are you facing in life because of BJP being in power? What erosion of freedom of speech are you seeing in your life that is making you say this?\n.\nSee the issue is simple, majority of the people in India are happy, they are getting by happily, and that's why BJP is in Power. People who actually work hard, day after day, are making money. People who sit idle are unhappy because handovers are coming down. There is a definite hatred against the appeasement politics that was played in the last few decades, which has anger resentment and sadness suppressed for many years, that finally when they see someone representing their rights, and the majority rights are being talked about here, then they blindly support the party. \n\nSo this is how I would evaluate with comparison. For years, people of LGBTQ communities had been suppressed and downtrodden by West. Eventually they saw a Messiah in Trudeau or Biden who made their lives easier. These are not majority, but they had voices which were heard and thereby, people voted. Majority in this case was, meh, well nothing bads happening with me, so yeah let's support them. But these idiotic governments forgot that they have a larger fiduciary duty to citizens in general, where they ensure life is still possible, houses are still affordable, groceries are still available, food is available and instead, they failed the masses greatly. This is basic Maslows Hierarchy. As the basic necessities fail, then only will people revolt. \n\nComing to India, yes we have inflation but still under control. Safety measures like doing stopping export of food grains outside the country, etc, these are safety measures. BJP and the party in Power have think tanks, which do they job of strategic planning for them, which for so many years, i don't see Congress using. Even though BJP is pleasing the majority, they still ensure that the country is running and winning. Imagine a Congress government taking a stand against Ukraine supporting Russia. India made the best out of this situation. So even if they let propaganda run wild, hey, my country is still affordable, still livable. So as a citizen, I am happy to really ignore a lot of issues, as long as my basic needs are met, my security is guaranteed and my future is somewhat plannable. That's all that the common man thinks. As per maslows Hierarchy, once we get all our basic things satisfied, then we look for higher meaning in life. I want work life balance, which I will never get in India. I want evenings to my self, which is still not even possible in India. And they are now slowly working towards these being possible in India. So why in the basic hell would a common man be unhappy with BJP. Whatever OP listed, sounds like a rant of someone who doesn't like BJP, maybe because of OP's political affiliation or religious stand. Well tough luck. I know things will not be the same as always. Someday BJP might decay and then it could be bad, but till then, might as well enjoy life while I can. Will worry about bad India when it comes to that. And even then, I will not complain, I will figure out a way to get going with my life, make something out of it. People like OP will only keep complaining and doing nothing about it.",

Failed to meet up with the rising population, Extended delays in government job exams and hiring. Letting vacancies sit idle. Plus the relaxations in labor laws for MNCs to exploit Indian workers in the name of SEZs is brutal as well. \n\nFor education they have again done well, besides making meaningless changes in the curriculum. Talks about a hybrid NEP are promising where they talk about Letting students choose any subject they want to plus vocational training. Scholarships for higher education and opening of new IITs, IIMs , Aims and NLUs \n\nSafety is a issue they need to work on, they have done great things towards public safety in Uttar Pradesh. States like Rajasthan, Bihar , Haryana West Bengal need a lot of work in this matter. Crumbling Judiciary is a major issue that delays justice for the non-millionaires. \n\nThey've hit a home run on housing and food safety, with PM Awas Yojana and Distributing ration to those in need. \n\nLocal Governance has been fantastic as well, digitalization has played a huge role in this. Now regarding municipal bodies you can file online complaints and government servants get work assigned through government apps and websites. \n\nRepresentation wise they have again fullfilled all the requisites, with complete ignorance of tribal culture to bringing tribal issues to light. Jan Jatiya Diwas celebration and Making a ST woman President. EWS reservations as well for the financially weaker section of unreserved category.

No Indian media will have him on for debating with any BJP top brass, let alone Modi.\n\nHe has such thorough understanding of the country, where we are and where we need to be and how to get there. \n\nHere are the things he said. \n\nEconomy : \n- I don't think we can directly import capitalism. India's problems are homegrown and our solutions must be homegrown as well.

We can't and shouldn't compete with the Chinese method of manufacturing with child labor, no worker rights and loose environmental policies/\n\nGovernment : \n- Its not like I know everything and I wave a magic wand. What I will do is hire the best people and hold them accountable for results. A good leader should know how to delegate tasks. I will also rebuild the trust on our institutions. It's important that the government doesn't interfere with independent institutions such as Supreme Court or RBI. \n\nPolarization :\n- I think this narrative that there is a lot of religious tension and as Indians we can not get along is true at all. It is actually a very few people that are on the extreme and our legal structure can and will handle that. \n\nHis ideas are top notch. His vocabulary shows his clarity of thinking and how well read / informed he is. He walked the country from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. \n\nI honestly have seen more interviews or RG from BBC and other western media than Indian ones. He walked specifically because of that. \n\nYou vote for BJP this time and this is the last real election to happen in this country. 30 years from now, when BJP is done bulldozing the country and either there is a huge violent reshuffle or country is broke into parts, you will realize your part in what happened.

And that is too heavily biased towards the service sector. Rest of the state is hanging on employment benefits, popularly known as freebies. Even agriculture has a bloated workforce and needs regular bailouts from the government.\n\nThere is too much dependency built on politicians.

As long as people are not ready to shed violence in their language , we are not getting anywhere. Any politician who talks of violence should be shunned by people. But do our people have that moral wisdom. no? They would choose whataboutery instead.\nCaste discrimination is a reality. Lesser in intensity yet it still exist. It’s not too long ago (read 90s) Caste violence and discrimination was an everyday thing. \nWe as a society in general have not come to terms with caste based discrimination. People just say don’t talk about caste but what about the damage that was done to psyche of a scheduled caste / ST community as a whole with thousands of years of discrimination.\n I will give you simple example, that you can verify anywhere. Tier 2 town or below -> Go to lower middle income class family of an upper caste and a lower caste. criteria is both family’s income should be same. When you go and look inside their house , you will know the difference.  Their lifestyle, talking pattern, Confidence level and everything. You will always find the people from lower caste living a substandard life in comparison to a family of upper caste in same income group. There can be exceptions but in general, it will be true.

But right now, most of the FDI in the country is going into service sector. The problem with a strong service sector is that it doesn't lift the country out of poverty or strength the middle class.\n\nWe need huge manufacturing jobs all over the country to pull our people out of poverty like China did.\n\nIndia needs a GDP rate higher than 10 to prosper at current rate which looks good on paper, we are just keeping with what we have.

        "[Shekhar Gupta on the 2019 election results.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwnnn1M-T5U) \n\nI think the infrastructure point's importance is highly under-rated. To the common man, rich and poor, hard infrastructure is what you see in everyday life and it is something very real. An interesting parallel is the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s in the USA, today Eisenhower is remembered as one of the best presidents primarily for having built the interstate highways system. People still use the highways today and Eisenhower is remembered for that infrastructure. Interestingly, Eisenhower was inspired by the German Autobahn system built by the Nazis, and the autobahn system too is still famous today as some of the best and highest speed highways anywhere in the world. Similarly other nations have also had their phases of industrialization and breakneck infrastructure development, like Europe, Japan and South Korea post-WW2, and China in the past 30 years. It's only now that India is in its catch up phase and the BJP is plastering it on everyone's minds with Modi's image on it.\n\nShekhar Gupta outlines this delivery of promises quite accurately in the above video. Whatever Modi and his BJP do, the narrative is such that the public views him as a man who's at least trying to bring in innovative and tangible solutions to problems, even if his plans fail. Modi shoots 10 shots and maybe 3 work well, but that's enough for his popularity to sustain. JAM trinity is a good example of this. Jan-dhan accounts, Aadhar cards, Mobile phone connectivity (JAM) which have enabled the govt to directly transfer subsidies and benefits to the poor man's bank account. For the middle and upper class, UPI has become a tool of everyday convenience. Sure there might have been corruption with the ambanis rapid jio expansion, but that shook up the market, forced airtel, vodafone, idea to become competitive and today, millions are hooked to this fast internet.\n\nAnother important thing about the political situation today is the Gandhis' almost complete ownership of the Congress and their reluctance to talk about the good things that Manmohan did during his long tenure. A lot of infrastructure was built during Manmohan's time like the metro in Delhi, airports in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities, electrification of rail etc. There was massive corruption in the building of the Delhi metro but who cares about that now, the metro got built and crores use it every year. There still is corporate corruption by the Adani group and others in the development of new airports, ports, tunnels, roads etc. but again nobody cares as long as the infrastructure gets built. But congress missed a trick by not talking about their achievements enough, while BJP shoves it in everyone's faces every chance they get, which isn't really a bad thing.",
        "In fairness Bangladesh had a famine in 1974 which should be at the least noted.",
        "There's pictures of mass week long massacre you teenage monkey. Thousands of them. Enough for other nations to think and specifically blacklist some random ruler of a state back then. All these stats Modi is so expert in faking up and all the desi courts giving clean chits will never erase that stain in India's history. Go read the definition of literacy rate in India, it's anyone who can read and write any one language and did class 5 in school. It's way easily fakeable and pointless metric than you think. Comparing GDP and not PPP or HDI especially when comparing with old socialist states like WB and Assam is monumentally disingenious and reeks of whatsapp forwards for unpadhs. Look also into how your stats have fared over the years, before and after 2002. You're practically doing the equivalent of holocaust denial just because you got some privilege and debelopment back by skinning someone else's.\n\n\n>he percentage of Muslims occupying higher posts is also far greater in Gujarat compared to other States. I will give only one comparison. Of the 25.2 per cent Muslim population of West Bengal, only 2.1% have benefited from government jobs. Gujarat with only 9.1% Muslim population, 5.4% have government jobs. \n\nzero source. How many Muslim MLAs are present in assembly and parliament representing them from gujrati constituencies?",
        "Good points, one more thing i would like to add is he pushed common people for cleanliness to an extent, the effect of which can be seen. And for the con i would say incompetency of home ministry in addressing internal disputes many times, so much so it feels he is purposely letting the matter escalate for voting advantage.",
        "I would say the COVID situation got handled pretty well, if you think what could have happened. The density of India is one of the highest with such a big population, can't have enough professionals in such a short period. \n\nKudos to our health care workers.",
        "A lot of us did not live to tell the tale. How quickly have we moved on 😐",
        "I think you are grossly misinformed. COVID was a fiasco, period.\n\nIn the beginning of the first wave, it was recommended by ICMR that we need to set up oxygen plants, because the need for oxygen was expected to increase a lot due to the virus based on global trends. Several of these were commissioned, but their progress was never monitored, and very few were completed.\n\nThe ruling party had a meeting right before delta hit, in which they congratuled themselves for beating covid. This was problematic because there was sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that the epidemic will come in waves. Hence, a second wave was expected.\n\nWhen Delta hit, even a month before the worst period in Maharashtra, the chief minister had requested support of the centre to airlift oxygen to the state as a shortage was expected.\n\nThe government did jackshit. In fact, they only became proactive right after the worst had passed (read: most people who could have died, had died). And what it really obscene, is that the BJP IT cell tried a PR stunt by tweeting about all the amazing work the government was doing: started posting photos of ventilators and other equipment that was being imported from the US, and other random things about Modi saving is from delta.\n\nMy opinion is that given the resources at the hand, it should have been possible to set up the required number of oxygen plants, or at least, mandate medium/large hospitals to set up their own (many large hospital did already have them, but they were inaccessible for most people).\n\nThe government fucked up. Could another government have done better? Not sure. But this was the government  we had, and it should have done more for the lives of its citizens.",
        "Rahul Gandhi fan boiiii",
        "No one cares about Covid. \n\nNot even the en mass cremations or piles of floating bodies could convince how the govt left their citizens out to die and hid critical information, \n\nLife is cheap indeed.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "A common person's view of BJP government since their rule started in 2014",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "This post is divided into pros & cons of Modi govt from 2014 to date. Pros 1) rapid growth & improvement in transport infrastructure. 2) make in india initiative which enhanced the manufacturing capacity of india in some aspects & increased both domestic & foreign exports of various goods. The export sector has particularly improved. 3) terrorist attacks on civilians declined considerably. Excluding J&K, the overall civilian safety from terrorist attacks is now far better. 4) the no: of international companies & their investments increased. 5) military has been modernised & equipped with better quality weapons & various other tools to some extent. Cons 1) various botched projects/policies such as demonetisation, GST, farmers' issues, manipur ethnic class issues, delhi/uttar pradesh communal violence & riots, aadhar card data leaks, wrestlers' issues, covid lockdown & vaccine policy & so on. Demonetisation was a fiasco. It was a ludicrous policy by govt. GST was bungled by govt to a huge extent. 2) disdain for human rights. 3) fundamentalism/bigotry & peddling of pseudoscience. 4) controlled mass media (godi media) Bjp/nda supporters & followers while defending godi media should understand that media was one of the paramount reasons for the defeat of congress/upa government. During the rule of congress/upa govts, media was far more independent & powerful. A lot of medias were against govt. They often criticised & trolled govt. They informed the general public about govt's various issues & faults from time to time. Some of the national medias were usually on their toes to chase & find out the govt's misdeeds. This was especially very evident during the UPA 2 govt. To put it in a nutshell, media was the 4th pillar of democracy during those days. But unfortunately, today that's no more the case. 5) distraction of actual issues by diverting public attention to islamophobia/christianophobia/sikophobia & pakistan/china along with ever growing nationalism & jingoism to also deviate people from other relevant issues (to be not confused with patriotism which is the positive side). 6) religion (hinduism) and various government policies/actions are mixed with each other. 7) protection & garlanding of rapists & hate speech proponents. 8) rampant crony capitalism and all level govt corruption (gautam adani & PM CARES fund are apt examples). 9) complete lack of transparency in various govt accountability matters/incidents such as PM CARES fund. 10) suppression of citizen participation in democratic processes like RTI & improper response given to their queries by RTI. 11) inauguration of half-baked infrastructure projects. Many of these projects were & are incomplete with lack of property quality, safety & reliability at the time of their inauguration & thereafter. 12) make in india project's vision was not fully realised. There were several issues with it in respect to quality & reliability of various products. The govt failed to extensively utilise its scope & further potential. Another point worth noting is whataboutism & blame games that are some of the major tactics which are often used by BJP govt as a part of their strategy to conceal their faults, responsibility & accountability. Although they have been ruling India for nearly a decade now & had also ruled india in some other terms before 2014, but they still keep on blaming Congress/UPA for any issues & faults which is hypocrisy to the peak. But what they fail to understand or intentionally don't realise is that they were overwhelmingly elected to form govt by the majority of indians in 2014 to fix the issues & faults of Congress/UPA government terms. But it turned out that BJP govt is far more evil & corrupted to the core along with their communal hate & divisive politics. Anyway, these lists are by no means exhaustive.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I’d argue that the attacks on civilians have increased or at the very least stayed the same. It’s just that these internal terrorists are called patriots or nationalists now. All they do is hide behind various names I specifically meant those terrorist attacks like the ones we commonly used to have pre-2014 in the form of mass terrorism. >I’d argue that the attacks on civilians have increased or at the very least stayed the same. Yes. The extremist attacks have tremendously increased post 2014 expecially due to the influx of right-wing organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal & so on. >It’s just that these internal terrorists are called patriots or nationalists now. Pls don't put patriots & nationalists together. They are way different from each other. Our country actually needs patriots instead of today's nationalists Now I understand what you were going for. And you are right we definitely need true patriots in this country. What I meant to say is that these people call themselves “patriots” and hide behind that tag 1. Initiators, takes bold action and reforms although not necessary what they do is always good. 2. Aggressive, nationalist. Propagate not just Hindu nationalism but indian nationalism which is not limited just to post independence but embrace ancient Indian glory. 3. Hate mongers, spread hate openly and make stupid out of people or maybe the people make themselves stupid just to ignore their hate acts because they like pt 1 and 2 about them and Avoid any reason to vite them out. >these people call themselves “patriots” and hide behind that tag Yes. That's the unfortunate reality Appreciate the effort and the exhaustive write up and putting many points in. But what rapid growth or we talking here, The average annual growth under Supreme leader is lower than under previous government. Infrastructure is fine, they spend money but it's mostly by borrowing. Make in India is mediocre. Indian manufacturing share of GDP is still pretty much as before. Trade deficits especially against China is still very wide. If you add how these ass wipes have changed the moral fabric of the nation one has to wonder if Vikas is just a step brother pretending to be your brother and making grand promises on Raksha Bandhan >Appreciate the effort and the exhaustive write up and putting many points in. Thank you >what rapid growth or we talking here I didn't mention it in pros >The average annual growth under Supreme leader is lower than under previous government. Yes. It has drastically declined >Make in India is mediocre. Agree. It's not up to the mark Every person ik who supports this party have said Infra has grown considerably, especially in the northern states. I'm from the south and have no idea about it. What infra are they talking about? Didn't a bridge collapse in Ahmedabad last year? Chennai to Bangalore expressway which they've claimed to have completed, has been in a pathetic state for the last few years (last time I travellled was 3 months back) Good post! Aveage GDP growth is higher than UPA if you exclude 2020 and 2021 which were covid years cant really blame BJP for that that Gobar(cow dung) states are so poor and illiterate that even an installation of brick is GOOD INFRA for them. Regional Hate much? They must be talking about Statue of Unity least hate mongering southie incest , get some life and stop bootlicking stalin or any other regional leader What it tells about congress rule if even a installation of brick is considered good infra now? Sanjay Bhatt Kafeel khan Nope UPA still had a higher average even accounting the 2008 recession. Also BJP have changed the method used for GDP growth evaluation back in 2015 to show higher numbers. Fyi, i mentioned both pros & cons of it You are not a common man >have no idea about it. What infra are they talking about? Didn't a bridge collapse in Ahmedabad last year? Literally takes a Google search to know what infra they are talking about, but all you chose was a \"bridge collapse\"(like it didn't happen under any other government)to publish a complete conclusion that no infra development took place Thank you My father says Modi seems very competent, not because that is his quality, but because his opposition is very incompetent. And I must say I agree. Putin purposefully cultivated an incompetent and useless opposition so people would always vote for him. Modi didn't have to take any such troubles. People vote for Modi because they distrust RG. Unfortunately thst is what our national politics has become, Modi vs Rahul. There are lot of claims over the internet, I'm just trying to know the authenticity by irl examples. Also, haven't seen an instance where a bridge collapsed leading to 100+ casualties in a renowned city, which is under the rule of the same party for the last 25 years. This is probably the best summary if last 10 years His reign is basically Sabka saath adani ka vikaas 1) India getting more foreign investors is natural, our economy opened in 92 and thr base was set by upa govt. I don't think bjp boosted fdi so much to give them credit. 2) Military getting modernized, improving our arsenal Etc means nothing to a common citizen. All I can say is upa govt didn't let Chinese mfs to take a huge portion of our territory. After all the the Conway blast happened in modis time and abhinandan episode was very embarrassing for Indians in the world stage. I was feeling good about the surgical strike until Modi govt wanted to have an annual commemorative kinda thing for just killing a handful of jihadis...Congress won us wars against pak but they never took credits like Modi did. 3) infrastructure is one good thing happening, I will give credit for this. Even the last vajpayee govt was excellent in this regard and Modi doing it efficiently. 4) 100% electrification of railways and more toilets is truly a Modi achievement, let's not take this away from him but at the same time I feel railways is managed bad than ever before. These vande bharat is a good initiative but less general bogey, less sleeper class Etc is the main concern. Also the frequent railway accidents and still the railway minister being in power Etc only means railways is fcuked under bjp rule. Upa wasn't this bad also wasn't innovative either. 5) make is bharat is a double edged sword,on one hand it promoted local business but with that policies the crony capitalists also got trade protections for their companies. We were only scammed by this scheme, remember the freedom phone for 500 rupees and I recently saw a review about made in India jio laptops which are just absolute scams run by the richest guy in Asia. I am not against economic protectionism, but if I have huawei then I'll protect the company but it is stupid to protect cheap ass fraud companies in India ( not all but most in tech are frauds). Modi vs Rahul is stupid. Rahul cannot be trusted to affect a run out if both batsmen collide, tangle, and lie stunned in the middle of the cricket pitch. The scam foisted on the public is 'No Alternative' so everything Modi does is accepted. This is a PM who lies ( DeMo, PM Cares Funds) about money but is not taken to task. One important point that affects every common person and that people don't easily recognize is the governments handling of inflation. Inflation is essentially stealing from your savings. Every paisa you earned and saved 10 years ago is worth half a paisa now. Meanwhile extra liquidity in the market allow the rich to exponentially grow their wealth. That is why it is said inflation disproportionally affects the poor. For 2008, 1. We weren't as connected to the the western world as you think we were 2. Our NPAs were controlled 3.our demand wasn't artificially inflated. You can't go wrong with such factors in hand No argument about that. But in elections , people want to know who will become PM/leader. A person with a strongman image/reputation is trusted to keep his flock in line while a person without such an aura is distrusted, people say how will he bring change, run the country if he can't control his party officials. Rahul is not viewed as capable leader. What votes they get is from old time loyalists or because of strong state organisation/leaders. But state leaders don't matter much in national elections. All other leaders in INDIA are limited to their respective strongholds. So no national narrative that can sufficiently unseat BJP. Also INC gets very complacent in between elections. After K'taka, they seem to think anti incumbency and freebie promises will win them the elections. We have seen how it went recently. i never saw any transparency in anything in any party ruled till now Unable to edit the post. So, adding a con here. The recent haryana communal violence & riots 5 pros and 12 cons 😂😂😂 Where is covid time line performance? I wish we had better opposition tbh. Even tho modi is very conservative, he's competent enough to run the govt. However the problem gets deeper as their government suppressed all voices against them which instead of getting under pressure and working better, made them have no resistance to whatever and whenever they want. Plus the religious polarization is a big deal since it's purely for votes as these guys have least concern with religions I’m curious to know how one measures infrastructure growth and compares them to another government ? major missing: covid 2nd wave (much like oxygen) Strong image and reputation for modi ? it's all false narrative ask a prudent and rational PPL they are really fed up with this foolish madi and his motabhai , modani gangs >Rahul is not viewed as a capable leader. Wait until bjp comes down from power and speak about the leadership. When in post and power everything and everyone will surround you . The real game of power and leadership start when you lose power. Rahul is not in Power for 10yrs. All your pros are not completely true except the 1st one. >During the 2nd wave of covid, vaccines along with oxygen cylinders & other medical amenities' production & supply were very low in india. But government still exported so much of them to other countries as a PR stunt when our country was undergoing a massive crisis. The govt should have first ensured that the domestic needs are fulfilled at least to a very good extent before exporting simultaneously or they should have helped other countries later The govt basically bungled a lot in covid policy Anti service class is another con. On ground,people are not quite happy or satisfied but congress has failed to present itself as an alternative. For opposition alliance to win,they need a PM face. Statue of stupidity That's a pro dude they will get votes out of it . It's my view, after all. But i welcome other perspectives. I also mentioned the cons of some pros Measurement is not needed media news is sufficient. opposition is there, its the media which has lost its teeth Yes. For them, that's obviously a pro. Anyway, i got downvotes for mentioning it😅 I mean, it comes from a bias. Godi supporters would've given you 12 pros and 1 con: \"fails to deal with Muslims hard enough\". Everyone has an obvious bias and this is probably one of the most objective analysis out there. Can you elaborate with actual points with proper evidence and reasoning? Rahul and Co were in oiwer for 10 years beforr 2014. They had the opportunity to investigate and indict Modi for godhra riots. They had an opportunity to build a strong political network and grassroots connection using welfare schemes. Did they do it? Did they use their clout on the media? I'm not saying I like governments controlling media, but when you are in power, how incompetent must you be to allow the opposition (then BJP) to hijack media and narrative? Look where that has brought us now. Congress has just got a humiliating drubbing in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where they already were in power! Why did they lose, especially in Chhattisgarh? That tells miles about how politically effective INC is as a party. Also in MP they had a golden opportunity, but wasted it. Many people are fed up with Modi, ok. But why is bjp vote share still increasing, while congress is not? What does that tell about how people view RaGa and his team? Get out of your cocoon mate. The thing is, whenever you think about a national govt, you think of a leader and his party’s vision. Right now, bjp is thriving because of an absolute lack of sensible and strong opposition. Plus the level of exposed corruption (keyword - exposed) during upa 2 has given people ptsd. Modi and his govt are smart about it, in the way that they’ll never fumble a major scam expose like congress. Corruption as a whole is an integral part of indian govt since our inception. How do you think were the billionaires thriving even under govt controlled license raj of the 70s and the 80s. This is true even for developed country like the u.s where billionaires will always field their candidates to get rebates when the said person wins. It is not ideal, but unfortunate reality. There is no opposition, there is no vision. Kejri could have filled this void perfectly by rising to national politics but he is too busy in clearing up delhi and punjab mishaps and his party is slowly but surely getting the image of hypocrites. Mamta will never have a presence out of Bengal. And Rahul is utterly incompetent and can never be the face of a winning congress. Even in the states they have won, it’s mostly because people were fed up of the other parties. (Winning by default, much like aap in punjab). Congress will time and again assure people of democracy within their own party but will neither accept nor refuse any claims that they aspire to put rahul at its helm. Man is just not fit to run this country. I’ve said this before and i’ll say it again, as long as a gandhi is at the top of congress food chain, only yes men and loyalists will be allowed to thrive. This is essentially degrading a national party (which i think bjp will face too if shah takes over from modi, that man will ensure that bjp is his own personal army lmao) All these facts coupled with the development that people see around them and a sentiment of this govt being ‘scam less’ is what gives modi the edge to run again and win again. He forgot Demonitisation, Manipur murders, UP rapes by BJP MLAs etc. Amnesia is an enemy of the democracy. >Yes. The extremist attacks have tremendously increased post 2014 expecially due to the right-wing organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal & so on. No PFI ? Or the ppl caught who where linked with Islamist groups like the murderer of kanhaiya Lal and AL whattfinislam or the Naxals? I mentioned all of that in the post. Its not my fault that you didn't read them BJP has spent a lot of money on RG “pappu” campaign on media/social media and now reaping dividends. Also BJP controls funding of all parties indirectly through electoral bonds. Industrialists are forced to contribute more to BJP than opposition or face IT,ED raids. This leaves Congress with less funds and they have less volunteers and booth workers on the ground compared to BJP. Bhupesh Baghel, Mamata all gave contracts to Adani, but Soros ke chamche nahi manenge. India's GDP grew faster during UPA. Ok. India 's GDP in 2004 was 700 billion dollars India's GDP in 2014 was 2000 billion dollars. So India almost tripled its economy While India's GDP in 2024 by some estimate will probably be 4000 billion( probably). So India's GDP doubled in same amount of time. You think India is growing faster because the base year has changed. Railways are shit in South, in Telugu states atleast Vande Bharat goes the same speed of other trains and just costs 500 extra Would that be in pros or cons? Funds or not congress ruled states should show development to garner the trust of the people but that doesn't happen. An example is Chandigarh and Rajasthan. I do not think we have a better option than Modi. Congress is corrupt as hell. Congress = scams. Honestly the only and only problem is that it was a black swan event. So no matter who the govt is, it should not be compared compared per se. What do you think ? A common person on Reddit is an outlier in the common person of India. To appear more intelligent and sophisticated, these outliers will choose an ideology tilted towards left or right and will back it up with long paragraphs and copy-pasted facts from their favorite utuber comment section. I dont think a single Indian knows somebody who didn't die in the second wave while sahab was doing election rallies. So definitely a pro, because population control? a common person’s view is definitely different than yours. Keep talking to people from different sections and you will realise how easy it is for BJP in 2024 1. DBTs / PM anna yojana /Toilets - in short, populist schemes have worked for BJP & common people in gene recognise this. 2. Religion is important to common people. They see their TV & trust it. They think Hindus are in danger & congress & left are muslim sympathisers 3. Religious Inter-mingling is a big no no especially in recent years, big movies like kashmir files have been shared in various family whatsapp groups and jihad murder fiasocs of last years is fresh on everyone’s mind 3. They truly believe Modi has increased India’s prestige everywhere for ex, Modi stopped ukraine- russia war for Indians, Jaishankar is the new hero of young ones, G20 is because of Modi’s stature only. they truly believe in these things. 4. BJP propaganda reaches most homes through their whatsapp & socials ( opposition doesn’t reach even 25% ) All this without counting heavy biased TV news. 2024 will be a cake walk for BJP led by Modi INDIA alliance has failed to even start . In actual terms, those guys are outdated in their politics & lethargic. BJP govt works hard each & every hour to get votes by any means , ethics & morality is not an issue Godi media is extremely worrying. Any future govt would now think they can buy media and make them their pet. I'd add Jan aushadi Kendra in pros. It's a really good initiative. However there wasn't enough done for public hospitals and schools infra. They remain in same dire situation since a decade. as soon as the current leadership of all the opposition political parties retire from politics ,will be better for our country & democracy . those guys have grabbed their seats & not letting new crop of leaders grow. Those guys are , in some ways, villains of our country . Selfish & incompetent, is a combination lethal to Democracy Thankfully a post that sees both sides and not just hates or supports Modi blindly. > make in india This is at best a partial success and that too based only on the fact that this should have happened anyway to begin with. In real terms it hasn't born fruit yet. Manufacturing share of Economy and as Global Share has not risen, it has at-best remained stagnant (some data shows it's fallen as share of economy). > FDI This too isn't special, the graphs show basically similar range when adjusted by Share of GDP. In gross amount it was rising in late 2010s sure. > Terror thing This is selective bias. J&K isn't \"resolved\". NE maintains its mess. Naxals still exist and on top we have domestic Hindutva lynch mobs. The flurry of bomb blasts were already on decline by end of UPA-2 so it was more on Security agencies finally catching up than anything to do with Govts. The only thing they have is, bigger increase in Connective Infrastructure (roads, telecom, etc) but even that itself exists on above average because the deficit India has on this is massive and the way Jio did what it did was a farce. But sure, Corruption and Competence need not be mutually exclusive. What is Good and what is Bad exists on a Gradient/Spectrum. They are not Absolutes. To judge requires setting them against a Reference frame. And the biggest reference frame current Govt has is the Mandate Scale they have. Meaning they are to be judged against that, not simply that they are incumbents because even mid 90s Govt were incumbents but its a bit farcical to proclaim they had SAME sort of leverage/power frame of reference to be judged on what they could and should deliver. TLDR, given the mandate BJP has had, they have been an ABJECT failure of highest form. If THIS is what getting such huge majorities delivers, India is better off with coalition (real sort) Govts. >railways is managed bad than ever before 100%. It's impressive-ly bad Covid I hinkle they handled quite well. I mean no Government can handle it perfectly. You can't just build hospital and manufacture extra medicine in pandemics. No one can do that. There was oxygen shortage but was expected due to sudden increase in cases. The good part was vaccination and how they used app o give it a start. Obviously in Starting there was lack of it as production of such important medicine needs precision. That's a good thing imo. People are entitled to have different opinions. Bruh🤡 I don't understand what you mean by COVID lockdowns. During COVID I had travelled to many countries and tbh Indias response was the best I saw. Lockdown was a necessary measure. Modi could not have prevented COVID deaths but being such a poor country we had a very good survival rate. Rahul and Co were in power for 10 years beforr 2014. They had the opportunity to investigate and indict Modi for godhra riots. They had an opportunity to build a strong political network and grassroots connection using welfare schemes. Did they do it? Did they use their clout on the media? I'm not saying I like governments controlling media, but when you are in power, how incompetent must you be to allow the opposition (then BJP) to hijack media and narrative? Look where that has brought us now. Congress has just got a humiliating drubbing in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where they already were in power! Why did they lose, especially in Chhattisgarh? That tells miles about how politically effective INC is as a party. Also in MP they had a golden opportunity, but wasted it. Congress has many advantages but squanders them all. The congress today is still in a far better position than that of the Congress in late 1910's. They are power in 3 states. What have they done that is radically different and attracts common man's attention? What are they offering to common man, other than bjp bad, generic and overused statements like mohabbat ki dukhan? Their campaign and attitude itself is lacklustre. They are not utilising their funds to their fullest. Even in states ruled by then, they are not taking initiative to set the narrative. Congress has lost all fighting spirit-except in a handful of states. The simple fact that they have not been able to build organisation and win in India's most populous state since the 80's is testament to this fact. They have been in a state of decline long before Modi, with no will to treat the root cause of their woes. The whole world is slowing down economically and we are the fastest growing major economy. You can't directly compare raw numbers from two different times and situations. That's Democracy. The difference between Patriotism and Nationalism is #PATRIOTISM is loving your country for only the good things that it does and trying to fix whatever is wrong with their country. #NATIONALISM is loving your country not matter what it does. Living in denial of everything that's wrong with the country. And blaming others from those things. Others can be any minority or rival country or opposition. They are working on dedicated freight corridor, once that is complete, then 2-3 times of the passenger trains can run on the same tracks. How does the media and news measure it to compare it ? You do realize that they need to measure it too right ? Not having an answer is not an answer. >This is at best a partial success and that too based only on the fact that this should have happened anyway to begin with. In real terms it hasn't born fruit yet. Manufacturing share of Economy and as Global Share has not risen, it has at-best remained stagnant (some data shows it's fallen as share of economy). Yes. I also mentioned its cons in the post >This is selective bias. J&K isn't \"resolved\". NE maintains its mess. Naxals still exist and on top we have domestic Hindutva lynch mobs. The flurry of bomb blasts were already on decline by end of UPA-2 so it was more on Security agencies finally catching up than anything to do with Govts. I specifically meant those terrorist attacks like the ones we commonly used to have pre-2014 in the form of mass terrorism. Regarding J&K, i know that. The extremist attacks have tremendously increased post 2014 particularly due to the right-wing organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal & so on. Covid was at-least 5-10 times bigger than 2008 for India. Yes but they don't measure anything that's useful they are sacred of data . It may show them weak and expose their insecurity, but media ads are half the cost of measuring and no one will get the data only idea that there's development . The difference between Patriotism and Nationalism is #PATRIOTISM is loving your country for only the good things that it does and trying to fix whatever is wrong with their country. #NATIONALISM is loving your country no matter what it does. Living in denial of everything that's wrong with the country. And blaming others from those things. Others can be any minority or rival country or opposition. And the BJP is peddling NATIONALISM. Brush I just got downvoted for having a different opinion. Welcome to Reddit! If you did then they wouldn’t really be ruling anymore. Unwelcome me bruh, I am going sick. This iota of the population is more polluted than oil slick. It’s rare to see people with an intact brain here 3) Infra is nothing to be boasted about. It is a need for a developing country to become developed. It is not some charity done my infra ministers as many seem to put him on a pedestal Hope the finish it soon. Travelling on trains is a nightmare now. Well put. No hope for 2024. USA got rid of Trump but our country won't do anything on the whole even though the current government should have had big anti incumbency against it. Which huge chunk of land was allowed to be taken by China? I won't make the easy comment regarding Congress and Aksai chin. Just point out. The area. Also the inference that military doesn't matter? If you haven't noticed, we are not in some 1st world developed nation with equally developed neighbours who only want trade. We are surrounded by vicious, blood thirsty regimes who get wet dreams of seeing our country ripped apart. And the remaining neighbours are collapsing and all that crap happening close to our border is creating more headaches. Indian military is the only line of defence we have against this sh*tty neighbourhood. Ensuring that from Israel to Korea, the only government with any reasonable form of democracy is in India. You just mentioned Negatives which you think are not because you have any facts and figures to back them up , how was demonetization and GST bad for the economy please back your comment with figuratives rather than what you think. We already have figures for the economic growth , let's back the cons with figures shall we ?. Also don't you think corruption has actually gone down at least from the top and middle level tiers of governance ?. BJP has an ideology and actually i agree that they are taking advantage of Hindu votes , but they do things which many Hindus have been longing for many years. Maybe you do not see them as your aspirations cause you may not feel any discrimination as a Hindu as of now. But when you will actually deep dive in the constitution of India you will see that Hindus are actually the most discriminated ones, and the people with whom the politicians have been mostly unfair to. So an average rural hindu will always relate to the BJP no matter what you think , and highly educated ones too . Communal bigotry con against BJP is the biggest stupid argument one can make , because BJP has time and again shown that they can win votes of Christians too even in Christian majority states , even in Muslim majority seats so that's clear bullshit. Infrastructural development yes BJP does inaugurate unfinished infrastructure time and again , and I agree that it is just stupid to do so , but hey every party does that to keep in public light. And really blaming CONgress and the Gandhi's for the historic blunders they made in India's history , that is also a con ? How can that be a con ? Helding a party accountable for their past mistakes is the best thing BJP could do for India, as it would keep reminding both the Congress and the people of the mistakes done by CONgress. Which will force Congress to do better by chance if they come to power in the centre. People are not fools they remember everything. Media was more free at the time of CONgress I agree but is it free today for both of the parties , media polarisation is the biggest thing happening in India where CONgress loyalists are mostly accusing BJP of things that actually BJP has not done , where are the proofs of all the scams you mentioned against BJP ? . The opposition tried rafale , they had no proof that failed , they tried PM cares that failed , they tried IND vs China conflict tried to portray India lost land that failed , they tried Adani card paid hitjob through Soros and hindenburg that failed spectacularly recently US govt released a report saying Adani was accused falsely , remember all that opposition could speak of in recent months was either Adani , Ambani and nothing else ? , Then what came caste survey , opposition was trying to milik this thing like some surgical strike on the BJP that also failed . If you will see social media right now check how leftists congressi bigots are trying to paint the recent elections results as a north vs south victory where gaumutra drinking Hindi heartland are illiterate communal bigots and south is educated civilized , trying to divide People again to get votes . Whereas BJP has more lok sabha seats in the south than the COngress , at least 30 seats while CONgress having 29 . People have time and again shown that their mandate is with the BJP as of now. The thing is BJP is different Yojnas for the rural and poor India have reached deep into the villages of India whereas CONgres have completely lost the connection there , if you want to check how much better BJP has done in sanitation, cooperative businesses and housing in the rural India ,just check the figures of coverage of household and toilets before and after 2014. BJP has been the complete package for rural India , promised development delivered it , promises justice and delivers it in the form of various reforms and policies , and also is breaking the caste barrier through HIndutva while uniting Hindus votes under one umbrella. Don't be surprised if in future the caste system gets totally demolished in India. This misses so many bankruptcy law, ease of business by removing archaic laws. GST implementation requires everyone on the same page and that requires accomodation. Easier to find Yeti than an intact brain. >ndian manufacturing share of GDP is still pretty much as before. Trade deficits especially against China is still very wide And that's totally ok, strictly from an economic point of view, when an economy expands beyond its horizon the imports to that country increase. For example - when foreign investors will increase - more production happens - hence more imports happen - hence the wider trade deficit. It is after the manufacturing sector is built at its foundation that we see a declining trade deficit. MAKE IN INDIA is mediocre, yes I agree with that statement. Indian manufacturing will take time to progress it isn't easy, quality improves after a few attempts. Nobody, EVEN CHINA didn't got it right on the first attempt, how'd you think Chinese products got the reputation of \"shoddy and cheap\". There have been many economic changes AT THE FUNDAMENTAL level which will start to show benefits in a few years, like the ease of doing business is one, India moved up the ladder in the ease of doing business index due to fundamental changes by removing or reducing bureaucratic chokeholds. The situation isn't ideal but has IMPROVED A LOT. So my biggest problem is the lack of transparency on policies, media control Can some one ELI5 why GST is considered a failure? I am out of country for a couple of years but I thought it was implemented across the country and at a rapid pace. Where is it failing? There is a silent revolution going on. BJP or Modi is not in power. It is RSS and their vedic brahminic nostalgia that is in power. Nagpur is the real capital of the country. And they will eliminate anything that comes their way. Islam, misssionaries, Sikh self determination, tamil self.determination, Naga, etc etc. This is a project to undo constitutional progress. Don't make this into a raga vs Modi binary. Congress started the Brahmin baniya transfer of power and capital from the Brits. Now it is further consolidated with golwalkar 's and savarkar's (read Manu's)vision, as Congress didn't want to fuck with the constitution(not really but somewhat). The sangh today is swallowing ambedkar so that they can digest and throw him out of the wormhole. The sangh today disgraces the Dravidian movement(and DMK not helping either) so that the language of shudra-dalit unison stays a fringe thought. You must be deluding yourself to think that there is an electoral solution to this silent 'coup'. If you are doing this Congress vs bjp again and again. Maybe you are part of the problem. Maybe you are a beneficiary of this silent revolution. (you may feel guilty but yet live the privilege it brings) The lack of transparency regarding covid deaths and the UP hospital Kafeel khan fisco is definitely concerning. It was a black swan event and even many developed countries struggled. Its incredibly hard to deal with in our country but lying about it isn't the right way. The biggest problem, not only is he viewed incapable by the public, HIS advisors question his decision. That's the death blow. Everything mentioned in Cons point 1 can be its own point 😅 tbh Did I wrote this post???? It's exactly same as what I think about Modi Govt., You forgot one point in the cons which is the Pygasus virus, even till today there is no proper investigation into that matter. >Shah will think BJP is his personal army Totally agreed. I think in the degradation of INC there is a big contribution of BJP via Godi Media. I believe the question has some of the answers very well given. You do see an increase in number of manufacturing work coming into the country, thereby giving rise to ancillary industries. Slowly but steadily we are going good, though with quality issues, in the production space. I can compare it to my state which is a fuck all situation in Kerala. No business thrives there unless protected by government or owned by government. They have literally made it a commie state by all means. Ease of doing business has improved. A lot of cons have crept it, but that's part of the propaganda machine. We had appeasement policy for so many years, so what's wrong with the opposite policy for some time. These are qualitative issues which do not disrupt a political power in the country. When a lot of people or majority are angry, like here in Canada, then you have a revolutionary discussion disdain in the public. Life is still on in India, except for those who are now in the side against BJP. If you ignore politics and you live life as you fit deem, then you are great and happy. It's when you involve a party for India instead of India as a whole, that's when problem starts happening. What problems are you facing in life because of BJP being in power? What erosion of freedom of speech are you seeing in your life that is making you say this? . See the issue is simple, majority of the people in India are happy, they are getting by happily, and that's why BJP is in Power. People who actually work hard, day after day, are making money. People who sit idle are unhappy because handovers are coming down. There is a definite hatred against the appeasement politics that was played in the last few decades, which has anger resentment and sadness suppressed for many years, that finally when they see someone representing their rights, and the majority rights are being talked about here, then they blindly support the party. So this is how I would evaluate with comparison. For years, people of LGBTQ communities had been suppressed and downtrodden by West. Eventually they saw a Messiah in Trudeau or Biden who made their lives easier. These are not majority, but they had voices which were heard and thereby, people voted. Majority in this case was, meh, well nothing bads happening with me, so yeah let's support them. But these idiotic governments forgot that they have a larger fiduciary duty to citizens in general, where they ensure life is still possible, houses are still affordable, groceries are still available, food is available and instead, they failed the masses greatly. This is basic Maslows Hierarchy. As the basic necessities fail, then only will people revolt. Coming to India, yes we have inflation but still under control. Safety measures like doing stopping export of food grains outside the country, etc, these are safety measures. BJP and the party in Power have think tanks, which do they job of strategic planning for them, which for so many years, i don't see Congress using. Even though BJP is pleasing the majority, they still ensure that the country is running and winning. Imagine a Congress government taking a stand against Ukraine supporting Russia. India made the best out of this situation. So even if they let propaganda run wild, hey, my country is still affordable, still livable. So as a citizen, I am happy to really ignore a lot of issues, as long as my basic needs are met, my security is guaranteed and my future is somewhat plannable. That's all that the common man thinks. As per maslows Hierarchy, once we get all our basic things satisfied, then we look for higher meaning in life. I want work life balance, which I will never get in India. I want evenings to my self, which is still not even possible in India. And they are now slowly working towards these being possible in India. So why in the basic hell would a common man be unhappy with BJP. Whatever OP listed, sounds like a rant of someone who doesn't like BJP, maybe because of OP's political affiliation or religious stand. Well tough luck. I know things will not be the same as always. Someday BJP might decay and then it could be bad, but till then, might as well enjoy life while I can. Will worry about bad India when it comes to that. And even then, I will not complain, I will figure out a way to get going with my life, make something out of it. People like OP will only keep complaining and doing nothing about it. No, bro In UPA's rule RTI was much more strong then it's now We cannot compare Trump to Modi, Trump was a hilarious candidate and his whole presidency feels like an over-extended joke. . Modi on the other hand is a force to reckon with, are the Opposition has once again entered in an F1 race in a refurbished Alto 800 that is Rahul Gandhi Normally i would have taken that as sign of healthy inter party democracy. But not for Congress. But if he were a true leader, he would push on according to his convictions regsrdless. He would be able to bring different people on board for his programmes. But, alas. Reasoning kya hoti hai, rhyme bana ke Diya na bhai ne I would say, the Pandemic was a real challenge for any country to show how capable they are in the face of an unknown calamity, which initially was untreatable, and if we keep that in mind I think our Government did a good job of protecting people from what could've been Catastrophic. I Don't mean they were perfect, as many people lost their loved ones in the second wave that hit us, and a lot of us are still coming to terms with everything that's happened, but the 21 days lockdown, plus the rapid vaccination across the country to try to flatten the curve as much as possible, is an effort that deserves praise. And I don't Trust other parties with such things in their hands, as seeing how much they bicker among themselves. Construction of new expressways and tunnels is of the lever that you never expected in India. Cutting travel time in half and reducing road accidents as well. You have to be intentionally looking the other way if you haven't noticed the massive change in infrastructure over the last decade. There are a hundred flaws in the BJP govt, infrastructure is not it. Be reasonable and criticize where criticism is due Fair, also there were clear gaps that got exposed for good. Health care capacity, for example. Vaccination system still works like magic though 🙏 gold standard Yes. But my post is only a summary Why not? Both are from the same cabal for extreme right wing followers preaching hate. There was a subreddit that was banned with Trump followers because of their hate speech >I don't understand what you mean by COVID lockdowns. I meant the covid lockdown policy which is clearly mentioned there in simple english >Lockdown was a necessary measure. Yes. Obviously. Which sane person said no? But the way in which it was designed, planned & implemented went wrong especially the 1st nationwide lockdown Well I guess we need better journalists agree. Just wanted to highlight the heavyweights in the cons section 😊 >a common person’s view is definitely different than yours. Here, the common person is me & his view. That's why my post flair is rant/vent BJP offers \"Reduced liberty for increased prosperity (as the BJP defines it).\" It reminds me of what other countries are trying to do - \"How Rwanda is Becoming the Singapore of Africa\" Government shouldn’t have pulled back farm law. It was plain stupid. That too to get votes in Punjab. Government should have been firm. What India needs is a fiscally right leaning, socially left leaning government, that can get stuff done fast. These include bringing in Women's safety, freedom, empowerment and equality, massive investment in efficient infrastructure (physical, digital, legal and social) and education, building a market based modern capitalist, business friendly economy, encouraging domestic startups as well as bringing in foreign investments, building a reliable and efficient health care system etc. Economic protectionism is usually bad. Lol, this is no neutral, this is someone who hates Primary things I hate about the BJP govt. - 1) Criminals in the party and party protecting serious criminals. 2) Communalism and the pushing of the hindutva agenda. 3) Not passing progressive laws like criminalization of marital rape, legalization of same sex marriage and not bringing in a Feminist UCC despite promising repeatedly. Accidents got worse in 2023 alone. Not sure if this is sign of utter incompetence or sheer coincidence. Increasing 3A and AC Chair Car is good in select Trains of select Routes but i find it laughable and miserable at the same time that they have implemented this in long distance North and East Bound trains that cater to a lot of the lower working class who clearly just want to get in a train back home. They should gradually increase AC cars in Intercity Superfasts and Overnight intercity Mail/Superfasts. &#x200B; As much as I want to give them the Red Flag for Railway Management, I wonder what was even there pre-2013 to even manage it was just one system flailing its way through the years while Coach Colors changed every 20-30 years and new Locomotives made their way as Demand and Tech evolved. One word- superb India doesn’t vote on development. India votes on emotional reasons like Hindutva, corruption, national security and so on. Sheila Dixit did good work in Delhi but lost election on corruption charges. Today Congress in Delhi is decimated and could not even recover to number 2 position for over a decade. In Rajasthan, medical insurance that Congress provides was Rs 25 lakhs compared to Rs. 5 lakhs provided by PMJAY by centre. Bro stop giving inc a free pass in everything. Their current condition is their own fault and no one else’s. This is a national party degraded to a family club. What about the regional politics that Congress is playing, there is no Rahul there; it’s not about Rahul, it’s not even about the few good guys Congress has/had, even BJP does. Middle class wants economic growth and Congress couldn’t do shit for the decades they were in power. Even during 90s or 2000s after they opened up the economy, compare it to the rise of China during that same period. Also the terrorist/Pakistani attacks and the feeling of bias in favour of the Muslim community irrespective of the truth, there was no Godi media then to push the narrative, its not like Hindus started feeling the way do about Muslims post 2014. BJP also (mis)utilised social media effectively and made their supporters feel proud on the global stage (even if it is over trivial issues). They both grew together (SM and BJP). That's just one worker and one worker is not going to change the public opinion of Congress. Congress needs a strong leader who can control the party but that is missing. Rahul Gandhi is a decent human being but he doesn't have control over his party and gives too much freedom to his senior leaders. Not to nit pick here, and the OP has spent considerable time compiling this. One of the things that has tilted elections for BJP is Electoral Bonds. it gives them donations that are anonymous for the public but they know who sent it. Started in 2017 and while other parties use them too, the biggest beneficiary has been BJP. The money they get, they use to do PR and propaganda at a scale others can't match. Projects that have been completed by state governments get a photo of Supreme Leader and what's app learns that this only happened because of BJP. Chanakya's marketing machine is way more superior than the administration machine. You my friend, are not a common person. You are in a position of privilege, the average income of India is around 1.5 L a year. I don't think you are anywhere near that category of people. For the common man, life is much different and way more difficult. Issues such as Food Safety, housing,Employment, Education , Safety, Healthcare, Sanitation, Finance, Local Governance and Representation matter a lot BJP has brought in ground breaking advancements in healthcare , with ayushman Bharat insurance , Cheap Generic Medicines, significant reduction in cost of prosthetics and implants. In terms of Employment, they have faltered considerably. Failed to meet up with the rising population, Extended delays in government job exams and hiring. Letting vacancies sit idle. Plus the relaxations in labor laws for MNCs to exploit Indian workers in the name of SEZs is brutal as well. For education they have again done well, besides making meaningless changes in the curriculum. Talks about a hybrid NEP are promising where they talk about Letting students choose any subject they want to plus vocational training. Scholarships for higher education and opening of new IITs, IIMs , Aims and NLUs Safety is a issue they need to work on, they have done great things towards public safety in Uttar Pradesh. States like Rajasthan, Bihar , Haryana West Bengal need a lot of work in this matter. Crumbling Judiciary is a major issue that delays justice for the non-millionaires. They've hit a home run on housing and food safety, with PM Awas Yojana and Distributing ration to those in need. Local Governance has been fantastic as well, digitalization has played a huge role in this. Now regarding municipal bodies you can file online complaints and government servants get work assigned through government apps and websites. Representation wise they have again fullfilled all the requisites, with complete ignorance of tribal culture to bringing tribal issues to light. Jan Jatiya Diwas celebration and Making a ST woman President. EWS reservations as well for the financially weaker section of unreserved category. Finally getting the Women's Reservation Bill through When it comes to the common man, BJP has been the best political party Independent India has seen. However a deeper look at things reveal what is happening behind this populist government, control over media, Supression of Opposition by hook and crook, Breaching the independence of investigative authorities, promoting hatred towards Muslims. Demonitsation was a massive waste of time and resources. Delaying the census cunningly to effect Delimitation in 2029 elections. I won't talk about Covid as it was an unprecedented event and the Covid management in India was relatively better compared to similar nations. Mass Vaccination drives, Testing of Covid, prompt lockdowns and social awareness drives. They did what they could in the limited resources available. So from the point of a common man, BJP is the party you want to vote for. For intellectuals and people with long term goals they are dangerous. Yet the opposition promises to be worse at every possible moment they can. All in all, 2024 is a guaranteed BJP win. I'd Eve say 2029 if the opposition continues to play the political game of darts with blindfolds of nepotism on If my Daddy was born in Congo, I would have a 10 inch dick. If and but are part of life and one has to learn how to use their dick regardless of the size and not be a dick about it Good post though, lot of effort went into it. The 2017 electoral Bond launch is another win for BJP and loss for the citizen. Please tell that to the BJP IT cell who are still stuck finding Nehru ki galtis to hide their inadequacies. It's better to compare actual raw numbers than Cooked up numbers that IT cell sends via Whatsapp to you While I agree with your general gist that yes there are no miracles over night. You still can't run tremendous trade deficits and become completely reliant on one. We are already reliant on the middle East and others for oil, buying dildos from China ain't that important. I know it's a free world and people should be able to buy what they want but that's why we have a government to recognize an issue and fix it. I agree let's be cautiously optimistic that they'll find competent ways to get us ahead and shine Every budget has an allocation towards capital expenditures by the government then in the next one it has how much was actually spent. Economists then use that number as a percentage of the size of the economy and the size of the budget. It's a detail oriented job and in New India details don't matter but shiny things matter more Yes we live in a hateful world. Where exactly is he claiming to be be neutral. You can't drive being in neutral. Its in BJP's best interest that Rahul G heads the Congress. Congress is BJP's B team .. Two wrongs don't make a right You absolutely can, tremendous trade deficits are enclosed slowly and steadily. Remember, trade deficit kam karne ke liye you don't stop importing stuff instead YOU START EXPORTING MORE AND MORE AND MORE UNTIL THE DEFICIT IS NO MORE. The government can't and shouldn't stop imports to reduce the trade deficit instead they increase opportunities for exports by domestic markets. >congress & left are muslim sympathisers i mean they clearly are If you think only 5 lac people died because of covid in India then you will believe that demonetization is the master stroke of New India that launched UPI. In the state of Gujarat the applications to collect government remuneration for people who died of covid was 5 times the official death toll. There's an article in TOI about it. But then again people are free to believe whatever they think is correct. That's new India more style less substance Godi Media is new normal. What is INC doing to rise up? > where a bridge collapsed leading to 100+ casualties in a renowned city, which is under the rule of the same party for the last 25 years. i think you forgot to add some more conditions to your analysis. maybe try adding 'ruled by the party with three-lettered initials starting with B, ending with P and a J somewhere in the middle'. As I always say to myself If BJP is bad congress is worse Both are shit bag of useless politicians You can write 108 pros and call it Amrit kaal and you'll get your dick blown too. There are enough people in India to support any point GST is not a failure, the implementation of it was rather haphazard. Businesses had to keep up with the changes and got over whelmed. Today it's quite well streamlined Is it Godi media that is stopping Congress from expelling toxic leaders like Dig Vijay Singh? Your pros are quite weird. India is a developing country, rapid growth and infrastructure development will happen regardless of the govt in charge. The infrastructure development we had was mismanaged and corrupt (cough adani cough). No 5th pro wants to know about agniveer It's the godi media who is making even people like sadhvi win. That didn't answer my question What do you think you can do ? Bjp always as opposition created riots and made sure to burn buses. Made sure to corrupt youngsters by making them rss members. I remember bjp and other goon parties used to burn buses and break shops while protesting. Right now even if you protest you are called anti national. Modi is spending cores on media and IT cell to call other anti national. Earlier for rulling party it was opposition. But in modi era it's anti national to speak against him. That's how Hitler won and ruined the country and that's how modi will do >Right now, bjp is thriving because of an absolute lack of sensible and strong opposition That's what they want you to think. You agree what they say it's logical. The real pappu is modi. Rahul may not be a great orator but speaks well and is empathetic to the public. He regularly converses without a teleprompter and handles questions well enough. It is just the IT cell that has called him and bullied his image. Every video is edited to show he bungled somewhere. As for the post... The transport thing is a farce... NHAI is saddled with 3 lakh crore debt and that is why gadkari is looking for private investments. Military spending too is full of kickbacks... The army OROP campaign is so bad that many pensions and salaries require funding. BJP does on thing well... Publicity... Nothing else. It shares stories of congress bungling in 70 years to avoid their own problems that are ten times more. Corruption is legalized. Today mahua was thrown out... Journalists have been behind bars or killed.. Same with judges. Dissenters are termed ani nationals. This is the biggest disaster of a govt ever! at some point using the word propaganda is losing its meaning. Thats democracy as if another party wont try to spin a narrative. I agree trhat the toxic communalism by the right is dangerous but this is directly linked to the communal Partition of the countryt and the marxist like narrative India has had for decades. Always looking for an oppressed or an oppressor. Dividing people on caste faith and culture. personally i think a law of some sort to ban all religious or caste based politics would go a long way to stop this madness.Perhaps naieve but working on development for the poor and marginilized in india and not checking to see what caste or religion they r would get more things done.Its much easier to galvanize peoplr on religion and nationalism.But India needed a major jolt the vast majority suffer under abject poverty. Rememember every dollar spent on development gets people elected where as on education the issue is that any improvements wont be seen till a generation has passed. Im telling you the middle class in India has a confidence they never had before. The unabashed worship of everything western has dissipated > perception is reality . Congrees party has money as well why dont they just pay the media? The bjp is filling a need that India had. An angst. Its like in America the Democrats say Republicans are all racist while neglecting the root causes for the electorate to fall for trumps populist appeal. Anecdotally I can point to a change in mindset. India was a country where the educated elite would be embarrassed to speak their native languages. In fact I remeber a time where a Phd student in Sanskrit was told he was a gawar because he didnt speak english like someone from South Delhi.Our Filmfare awards would always only be conducted in English. Not at least if a presenter speaks hindi its not abnormal. I cringe at Kapil Sharmas comedy but somewhere its refreshing to see so called Hindi actors being forced to speak Hindi . Congress needs to fill that hunger and aspirational need.Simply talking about obc and freebies wont do it I think out of all the flaws of BJP, they key idea is that they are better than the other options given, from a time where all that was talked about was better roads, electricity, cleanliness service to now being at a point where the issues talked are communal and more inclined towards something beyond day to day means that there has been improvement in livelihoods. I always find my hometown improving so much and becoming more and more modern. the reason why BJP is holding power and expanding (their vote share in many states have doubled) is because how much they are improving the lives of an average guy, which opposition never targets. trump was also an incompetent idiot and more importantly Biden while definitely being better also sucked a lot But budget allocations aren’t that detailed (AFAIK). And we don’t have any standards or resources dedicated to measuring the utilization of funds (or do we?). I get it that new India doesn’t do any of that but there’s merit to keep discussing the what should it have been’s It's exactly this kind of logic and drives people from engaging the opposition and take them seriously. I mean no one believe that Modi is Gandhi, but it's people like you equating Modi to hitler and always use this line of thinking with nothing to show and argue is also the problem and you guys are not even self-aware of this idiocy. Agreed. I think they are talking about Himachal ? Some more cons perhaps 1) Thier administration during the pandemic was questionable. 2) The Make in India project was not actually a success Watch this for context: [what is vishwaguru making | MODI REVIEW Ep 2 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwi24h5Fygg&t=2s) 3) The changes in the history textbooks: [NCERT textbook revision: Why it happens every few years & what makes it controversial | Explained News - The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/revising-school-textbooks-ncert-8543190/) 4) Electoral Bonds and how they fundamentally change election funding and destroy transparency: [electoral bonds: Explained: What are electoral bonds?

Regarding other points, that's why i mentioned at the end that the list is incomplete You left out their unwavering support for the t3rror1st state of isr@3l lol... I agree but credit where credit is due you know ? Id never vote modi but bjp has always done good for infra especially vajpai. Don't let perfection be the enemy of good. Number 3 is extremely important for me! Stop terrorists in their homes not defending the implementation or anything but given the nature and size of our bureaucracy in addition to the general lack of awareness by our businessman,shitty implementation was expected. Average I could not have said it any better. Perfect assessment and weighing of facts. Unfortunately India does not have a strong opposition party at this point which makes simply means BJP will continue its reigns for some time Nice joke. UPA is worse. Huawei is a big scam. Their inhouse micro chips is supershit. I mean it gets the job done but it is 20-30 years behind the standard chips. Their satellite hone does no work. Their scanner thing is also a scam. There are multiple videos to prove it. It's just a CCP propoganda to get chinese citizens to buy chinese phones instead of an iphone. Can somebody explain the problems with GST because it was presented as a great problem solver by almost all media? I love that the pros are 5 and cons are 23. All the pros can be made possible by anyone, even you and i. Are you talking about PFI and muslim members of ISIS in India? Yeah you are right. Why did you forget about PFI and supporters of ISIS in India? Do you have double standards? Want them GONE! What you are doing here is essentially what Russia paid Cambridge Analytica to do. \"If you notice a group of folks who will never vote for trump, try to make them not vote for Hillary\" method. It's dishonest. \"I must say I agree\". How? Did you see any of his interviews? I bet you haven't because no Indian media will interview him. No Indian media will have him on for debating with any BJP top brass, let alone Modi. He has such thorough understanding of the country, where we are and where we need to be and how to get there. Here are the things he said. Economy : - I don't think we can directly import capitalism. India's problems are homegrown and our solutions must be homegrown as well. Look at our southern states, they have almost an Europe like social progressive model where both govt. programs provide the basic needs , homegrown industries thrive and international businesses can set up offices there. That is what we need for the whole country. - He said something about how to manufacture in a way that is sustainable and environment friendly with the partnership from the west - as an alternative to Chinese method. /That is the truth. We can't and shouldn't compete with the Chinese method of manufacturing with child labor, no worker rights and loose environmental policies/ Government : - Its not like I know everything and I wave a magic wand. What I will do is hire the best people and hold them accountable for results. A good leader should know how to delegate tasks. I will also rebuild the trust on our institutions. It's important that the government doesn't interfere with independent institutions such as Supreme Court or RBI. Polarization : - I think this narrative that there is a lot of religious tension and as Indians we can not get along is true at all. It is actually a very few people that are on the extreme and our legal structure can and will handle that. His ideas are top notch. His vocabulary shows his clarity of thinking and how well read / informed he is. He walked the country from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. I honestly have seen more interviews or RG from BBC and other western media than Indian ones. He walked specifically because of that. You vote for BJP this time and this is the last real election to happen in this country. 30 years from now, when BJP is done bulldozing the country and either there is a huge violent reshuffle or country is broke into parts, you will realize your part in what happened. We are at that tipping point now. We will look like Pakistan and Afghanistan. PMCARES was corruption ka nanga naach. And they forced every government body to donate to it. >Look at our southern states, they have almost an Europe like social progressive model where both govt. programs provide the basic needs , homegrown industries thrive and international businesses can set up offices there. I actually am uncomfortable with taking south states as a model for economic development. Most of the development is concentrated in one or two mega cities. And that is too heavily biased towards the service sector. Rest of the state is hanging on employment benefits, popularly known as freebies. Even agriculture has a bloated workforce and needs regular bailouts from the government. There is too much dependency built on politicians. Too much of exploitation of our rich resources without any significant value addition. That's not healthy. Right or wrong , development of a sturdy manufacturing sector is in need of the hour. No nation has ever progressed into prosperity without one. And what frightens me is that while BJP is too slow and lethargic in implementing it, Congress doesn't care about it at all, not in their manifestos or in their speeches. Few people like Manmohan cared, but couldn't rise above their internal coalition politics. You can't blame voters for not choosing this lopsided economic model. You mean terrorist hamas I am glad someone is pointing out this Modi-Shah duo. They are fast becoming the Gandhis of BJP. We need more moderates like Nitin Gadkari at the helm of affairs. True . I think you meant Chhattisgarh. Yes. On one hand, we have China and Pakistan breathing over our borders. On the other hand, Myanmar, Srilanka and Afghanistan were going down fast, threatening a refugee crisis. I sometimes wish our neighborhood wasn't this volatile. We could have done something if we were powerful enough. All we can do now is wait and watch. Gadkariji is unfortunately not considered in the race, due to health reasons or modi-shah’s personal hegemony idk. But undoubtedly the man has single handedly transformed the transport infrastructure of our country. I attribute this as the growing pains of an emerging economy. Asian Tigers went through this phase before they matured into full scale democracies. China and Singapore are still stuck in their authoritarian chapters. Although we have the ability to chart a course that's different to our contemporaries and offer a working economic model that doesn't require too much political suppression. It's not an impossibility, but requires a good amount of political will. Adding to the cons - 1. Complete mismanagement of Covid resulting in 4 millions deaths. Last time that many people died in the country was during the 1943 Bengal famine in colonial India. In 7 years, BJP managed to take the country back by 70 years. 2. Wrecked the economy and murdered citizens and livelihoods through harebrained schemes like demonetization and half-baked GST. Then claimed high GDP through manipulated numbers. 3. Murdered 40 jawans in Pulwama to win elections. 4. Orchestrated ethnic cleansing in Manipur. 5. Murdered writers and journalists like Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh. Even murdered an 84 year old human rights activist Stan Swamy. 6. Major corruption scams like RAFAEL and GSPC (KG Basin). 7. Hijacked democracy by pulling down democratically elected state governments in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra and northeastern states. 8. Hijacked democracy again by employing BJP governors to meddle with state governance that included repeatedly holding back bills passed by elected representatives in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Punjab, Telangana, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh. 9. Hijacked democracy still again by introducing electoral bonds. 10. Hijacked democracy yet again by unilaterally repealing article 370 bypassing elected representatives of JK legislative assembly. 11. Diluted the RTI act. 12. Corrupted education by inserting religious myth as facts in textbooks and removing even rudimentary science concepts like evolution and periodic table. 13. Caused highest unemployment in 45 years. 14. Tripled price of cooking gas from Rs.400 to Rs.1200 while spreading propaganda about free gas and delivering empty cylinders. 15. Spread propaganda about building toilets and making the country Open Defecation Free but in fact the toilets had no water connections and ended up literally being just a hole in the ground. 16. Devalued Indian currency from 60 INR to USD, bringing it down to the lowest it's been in history at 83 INR to USD. 17. Petrol prices crossed triple digits for first time in history. 18. High inflation caused essential food items like onion and tomato prices to soar 400%. 19. Waged a war against its own citizens with NRC, rendering 2 million stateless and throwing thousands in mass detention centers reminiscent of Nazi camps. 20. Indian government taken down to the level of Hindu Taliban, run literally by members of terrorist organization RSS that killed Father of the Nation with everyone from PM to HM and downwards being members of this terrorist organization. Okay. Tell me one party / leader, capable of handling national politics, has a proven record and has some vision for this nation, Not just ‘BJP bad’. Yes, if u think bjp is bad, so become better and take the reins. Wtf is remove modi, then we’ll “just wing it”. Thats no way to run a country. when modi came in 2014, his agenda was not just congress bad, he used to scam optics to his advantage, with his so called ‘gujrat model’ as demonstration for what he wants for the nation. Thats why he won. Tell me one single party / leader doing even remotely the same. Some of the cons were already mentioned in the post. But regarding other points, i already mentioned that the list is incomplete. There was also no option for editing it. Anyway, thank you for your input The biggest failure of BJP is in economy. Given our demographic situation, we should be growing our GDP at double digit percentage. That is what other economies had done when they leaped forward. That window is going to close in a few years. The second failure is steady weakening of institutions. I cannot think of any country that moved from developing to developed by weakening institutions and individual liberties. Here, we seem to be okay with detaining someone without trial for months. That is not progress by any means. MODI govt is extreme left wing in policy and far right wing in politics . Religion + nationalism + Welfare + unlimited power with no accountability + fake news factory . Not easy to counter,even for seasoned politicians and Congress is as incompetent, old politic, lethargic ,one family conglomerate, soon to be withered away party. They can’t I see what you mean. Another thing it takes is assurances and real threat of action so that there will be effective and democratically aligned checks and balances. That’s the problem with left wing around the world. They don’t learn easily. its stupid to think that TRUMP was an incompetent idiot , he is much more sharp than most left wing of USA. he knows how to organise his campaign & he knows his audience. something much common with our own beloved you are correct in your observations but incorrect in your assessment. Partition is the truth, you can’t do anything about it. communal harmony would not be restored that easily. It’s a problem of moral hypocrisy in our own society. We are way too inward looking in community caste religion or nation. As long as people are not ready to shed violence in their language , we are not getting anywhere. Any politician who talks of violence should be shunned by people. But do our people have that moral wisdom. no? They would choose whataboutery instead. Caste discrimination is a reality. Lesser in intensity yet it still exist. It’s not too long ago (read 90s) Caste violence and discrimination was an everyday thing. We as a society in general have not come to terms with caste based discrimination. People just say don’t talk about caste but what about the damage that was done to psyche of a scheduled caste / ST community as a whole with thousands of years of discrimination. I will give you simple example, that you can verify anywhere. Tier 2 town or below -> Go to lower middle income class family of an upper caste and a lower caste. criteria is both family’s income should be same. When you go and look inside their house , you will know the difference. Their lifestyle, talking pattern, Confidence level and everything. You will always find the people from lower caste living a substandard life in comparison to a family of upper caste in same income group. There can be exceptions but in general, it will be true. I have seen it, noticed it many times. This isn’t something I grabbed from some anecdote or book. You can easily see the hierarchy. About the religious polarisation, their main agenda is keep hindu muslims apart and suspicious of each other anyhow. And they have been winning for a while Gujarat ko hi swarg banake chodenge. Aur sab jaye jidhar jana hai yes, And. I meant the same. But when you introduce yourself as a common person, it feels a bit off from a common feeling. so I was just trying to differentiate that’s all. Modiji ghettoised an entire community in his state. Why would one bother to engage with a supporter of mass murderer. Man, you forgot the real pro. He banned TikTok. Now, only if he makes maximum notice period to 15 days for all the jobs, I will vote for him. With caste I will agree with you. No one said that India is perfect ..actually that was not the topic at hand. i was ta;ling about The Bjp and lack of a strong countering balance. In fact you could argue that the Bjp tries not to bring up caste issues to galvanize the hindus as a whole. Secondly I also agree that partition is done and They are two soverign nations with their own futures. I will also admit that being a punjabi we are a little too much pakistan focused and nostalgic about the stories of a United Punjab where communities lived together in relative harmony.Some of our prized historic sites are in Punjab such as Nankana Sahib ,Maharaja Ranjit Singhs capital and lets not forget Taxila is in Punjab. My point is that the two nation theory was so poisonus and its still effecting India negatively . The whole Kashmir narative is essentially about that theory. Though personally I would say that the creation of Bangladesh destroyed that narrative. Im not a bhakt and would love a viable candidate to lead the congress even though their role in the events of 1984 r well known. But I meant decades of vote bank politics has not stopped. Just two weeks ago south Indian politician promised to build an It park just for muslims. Know this perception is reality. In america today the job numbers came out and they r phenomenal. Gas prices have gone down 25-40 percent,inflation is down and the stock market is at an alltime high. Still trump has a very good chance of winning. Maya angelou an American poet said brilliantly once # “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” People feel that Modi and his goons are doing well so its a fact for them I have to challenge you on foreign companies and investment. FDI in India has decreased, it only increased for a brief period after Modi came into power in 2014, and it has decreased ever since. Famous companies coming to India to do business doesn't mean overall FDI has increased. Make in India, initiative has failed horribly. Our actual production capacity as a country has remained the same and in case of Small Scale Industries (SSI) their production capacity took a hit because they can't compete with crony capitalism. Terrorist attacks don't come on news because BJP government refuses to define what is a major terrorist attack, they only come to news when it's an Islamic terrorist no one mentions domestic terror attacks because they are not seen as terror attacks now. I mostly agree with the above . Just one thing, This could be a misconception in someone’s mind that If Congress leadership becomes better, democracy will be stronger in India. That’s a heavy misconception. ( I know you didn’t mean that, but if someone has been readjng these comments) supposedly, congress & bjp reverse their fate in 2024 . Congress will do almost all of the exact same thing that BJP is doing. It will control the media, use ED/CBI. Use miney muscle, EC everything at its disposal to do the same to BJP what they did to Congress in last 10 years. That’s a given. What I am saying is, democracy is not from these political parties but from people. If people become more vigilant and ask questions. Get their priorities straight, if communalsim > Employment & skill. Only then democracy and overall healthy discussion & debates would happen. it’s the people who have abandoned their role post#2014. If they don’t reclaim it, I am afraid, the political democracy in Indian is in downslide towards chinese autocratic regime. All the cons listed are subject to debate. All the pros listed are tangible and concrete improvements that BJP has made. What has congress done? Ok, my bad. Sorry for repeating. you are not a common person. isr@el does not support p@lestinians. There is overwhelming evidence To everyone who is saying we don’t have good opposition or they aren’t coming with anything good. Opposition or the ruling party both thrive on public support. We as citizens don’t even flinch when opposition leaders are hounded. When investigative agencies are misused to trouble them. Look at the conviction rate of ED. How much it is misused. Look how selectively law is applied to punish the opposition leaders while the leaders of treasury go Scott free. Look at the functioning of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the opposition leaders are not allowed to speak freely. The Presiding officers of both houses act in highly partisan manner. Aadhaar is a good initiative, but can it be called a money bill? Please read the definition of money bill and then tell me. MPs of ruling party will be punished, expelled at slightest issue while even big crimes of ruling party members will be forgotten. Current regime with its majority could have done wonders to make the country better. For e.g. Police Reforms, Parliamentary reforms, new reformed income Tax code. Improved the Governance structure, make investigative agencies better and answerable to Parliament, improved the governance. Made India perform better in health and education indicators. Spend more for health and education as a percentage of GDP. Re Point 8 : I think most average Indians will say that there has been less governmental corruption especially of the scam variety as opposed to previous governments Even if we were to take all of PM Cares as a scam then it's amounts are barely a drop in the ocean compared to the gigantic amounts of CWG/Coal/2G etc In fact their mostly scam free image is why \"Rafale\" and \"Chaukidaar Chori hai\" type slogans failed so miserably in 2019 In the early 2000s I regularly read about RTI activists being killed multiple times in newspapers. This was during Congress rule. Harrowing. Choosing govts is about choosing less of the two evils in any given election. We didn't make a good choice this time. I may be detecting a bit of a bias here from the OP. No worries, just helping out a brother. My list is incomplete as well. Feel free to add to it. >Gadkariji is unfortunately not considered in the race It's shame, considering he is a no nonsense politician, at least after he became part of the ministry. Modi Administration is been even better than Jawahar and Indira. It’s just that Modi critics are going crazy. They are now fighting for their political existence and relevance. And that they will go to any extent. If they are offered a guaranteed win for PM seat they will even sell the country in exchange. I would add our handling of CoVID in one of the pros. I genuinely expected our country, given its general state of hygiene and overpopulation to crash and burn. But we didn’t! My parents had covid during the second wave, which was arguably the worst time to get CoVID. And the way developed countries were plunged into crisis, I genuinely think we handled it better. Also integration of technology is a huge +. These are the sort of things we need from the ruling party. UPI, Aarogya Setu and several other technological developments are welcome and ahead of their time. Handling of Kashmir with a tighter fist was necessary. I know most people are just people but it’s the leaders that have sown poison in that state and it needed culling. Cons: some policies like Farmer’s bill got binned for the interests of winning state elections. That shouldn’t have been the case. It would’ve yielded much better results and wealth permeation within the non-Jatt and non-Zamindar population in India. If someone says Modi government has eradicated corruption I’d say not really. Rafale jets were one major example of this. There are several other things like Adani stock manipulation which was buried by the government. [What do you think?](https://pdf.defence.pk/attachments/1701586684881-png.1034070/) I guess as % of gdp it's decreased but I don't know how important that measure is “reduced liberty as long as you do not aligned with us” - BJP I will explain to the best of my ability. So, like in the Data you displayed, India's FDI has increased, but overall share of GDP has decreased. This shows that India's GDP has increased but FDI has not kept up with the growth, which depicts that even though the opportunities have increased in the country, foreign investors are varying of investing at the same rate they used to. * It basically suggests a decrease in foreign investors' confidence in the country's economy due to factors like political instability, economic downturns, or unfavourable policies. * It could also reflect global economic trends where other countries are becoming more attractive for investment compared to the one experiencing a decrease in FDI. * Fluctuations in exchange rates might make investments less attractive for foreign investors. India's manufacturing capacity is abysmal, and we need FDI and expertise to increase manufacturing in the country. But right now, most of the FDI in the country is going into service sector. The problem with a strong service sector is that it doesn't lift the country out of poverty or strength the middle class. We need huge manufacturing jobs all over the country to pull our people out of poverty like China did. India needs a GDP rate higher than 10 to prosper at current rate which looks good on paper, we are just keeping with what we have. China able to amass this much wealth because they kept growing for 10% of GDP every for at least 3 decades. We were only able to touch 9.3% for one year during UPA There are other points based on the foreign policy improvement, financial markets being at all time highs and ease on red tapism in incorporation of new business and ease of exporting. and also the revocation of article 370 I like him. He seems nice and generally positive person who speaks hindi and not like other folks. He has charisma and be the face of nation. Finally there is no alternative so it does not matter. Speak to those who lost family to COVID. They messed up big time. No govt can handle it perfectly yes, but did you already forget the chaos and death all around us? They could have done much much much better and saved a hundred thousand lives.. there was enough time between the waves to ramp up hospitals. They did well with the vaccines later on I'll say I could add another pro: improved access to electricity and tap water and toilets How the fuck is PMCARES a scam. It is exactly the same as NDRF. Bruh🤡 I understand your concern. Families who lost their dear ones have right to be angry and no amount of argument argument Can Justify their Loss. Remember it wasn't only us whole world, even welll developed nations were having same situation. You can ramp up hospitals but that's not enough. You need doctor, nurses, machines, basic medicine and facility. You can't get that over night. No one can increas/set up machine manufacturing in one month especially when whole world needs same. People were popping medicines like anything during that time. What do you want PM To talk about. He has to be positive in his speech to keep moral of people. There is always a scope of improvement But you need to consider all factors. If you look it from now we all could have done better but their situation at that time was different. Imagine what would have happened If we didn't have our own vaccine. I know government didn't find vaccine but to act on it and provide support to maakke it happen is important There are pros and there are cons. Personally I find that there are more cons. But as long as voters dont see a better alternative, they will vote for the incumbent. Congress, CPI, BSP and maybe others too, need a whole set of young leaders, with passion in them and some fight in them. These uncles are letting Indian democracy die to retain their minor positions of power. Though BJP is strong in Center. They are pretty weak in running state. Get a better candidate in the opposition, otherwise BJP is here to stay for another 10 years. Manufacturing did create jobs and so did foreign capital flowing into the country..this has a big effect on voting patterns. Bring a good candidate in the opposition and share their plans publicly about what they want to do for people and how they would...have you seen how Modi does it? all of their ministries actually share updates about various infra projects, various deals as well as ongoing investments via social media and pretty much everywhere and they do it even if it gets delayed. True but a lost investment has to come from private sector, govt cannot do it. In other countries private sector invests a shit ton. The tax paying base in India is so low they cannot lower corporate taxes either until the economy catches up. The only reason BJP is winning is because they are up against the weak opposition. What utter bullshit. Below stats are from Sachar Committee Report if you want to dig more... * Muslims in Gujarat have a literacy rate of 73.5 %, compared to the national average of 59.1% * Rural Muslim women’s literacy is 57 % compared to national average of 43 % * Urban Muslim women average literacy rate is 5 points higher than national average * Amongst those who completed their secondary education, Gujarat is at 45.3% ahead of national average of 40.5 % * In villages with over 2000 Muslim population access to education is 100 per cent with national average at 98.7 % * Per capita income of rural gujrat muslims It stands at Rs 668 while that of Hindus is Rs 644. This is much higher than that of Andhra Pradesh (Rs 610); West Bengal (Rs 501); UP (Rs 509); Karnataka (Rs 532); MP (Rs 475) * Prosperity of Muslims in Gujarat compared to other states is also reflected in terms of the bank account-wise average deposit. For instance, in Gujarat it is Rs 32,932 compared to Rs 13, 824 in West Bengal and Rs 26,319 in Assam * Employment of Muslims in critical departments of the government such as Home Department, State Transport Department, and public sectors is very high. The percentage of Muslims occupying higher posts is also far greater in Gujarat compared to other States. I will give only one comparison. Of the 25.2 per cent Muslim population of West Bengal, only 2.1% have benefited from government jobs. Gujarat with only 9.1% Muslim population, 5.4% have government jobs. With all the above, can you ask if a gujarati muslim wants to move to west bengal or assam? Having said that, do I think muslims aren't facing pressure? Yes, they are. But acting as if muslims in india, and especially in gujrat are being driven into nazi style ghettos is absolutely an insane assertion which only a idiot who does not know anything about history would make. Are you one? It didn't increase the tax revenue. [Shekhar Gupta on the 2019 election results.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwnnn1M-T5U) I think the infrastructure point's importance is highly under-rated. To the common man, rich and poor, hard infrastructure is what you see in everyday life and it is something very real. An interesting parallel is the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s in the USA, today Eisenhower is remembered as one of the best presidents primarily for having built the interstate highways system. People still use the highways today and Eisenhower is remembered for that infrastructure. Interestingly, Eisenhower was inspired by the German Autobahn system built by the Nazis, and the autobahn system too is still famous today as some of the best and highest speed highways anywhere in the world. Similarly other nations have also had their phases of industrialization and breakneck infrastructure development, like Europe, Japan and South Korea post-WW2, and China in the past 30 years. It's only now that India is in its catch up phase and the BJP is plastering it on everyone's minds with Modi's image on it. Shekhar Gupta outlines this delivery of promises quite accurately in the above video. Whatever Modi and his BJP do, the narrative is such that the public views him as a man who's at least trying to bring in innovative and tangible solutions to problems, even if his plans fail. Modi shoots 10 shots and maybe 3 work well, but that's enough for his popularity to sustain. JAM trinity is a good example of this. Jan-dhan accounts, Aadhar cards, Mobile phone connectivity (JAM) which have enabled the govt to directly transfer subsidies and benefits to the poor man's bank account. For the middle and upper class, UPI has become a tool of everyday convenience. Sure there might have been corruption with the ambanis rapid jio expansion, but that shook up the market, forced airtel, vodafone, idea to become competitive and today, millions are hooked to this fast internet. Another important thing about the political situation today is the Gandhis' almost complete ownership of the Congress and their reluctance to talk about the good things that Manmohan did during his long tenure. A lot of infrastructure was built during Manmohan's time like the metro in Delhi, airports in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities, electrification of rail etc. There was massive corruption in the building of the Delhi metro but who cares about that now, the metro got built and crores use it every year. There still is corporate corruption by the Adani group and others in the development of new airports, ports, tunnels, roads etc. but again nobody cares as long as the infrastructure gets built. But congress missed a trick by not talking about their achievements enough, while BJP shoves it in everyone's faces every chance they get, which isn't really a bad thing. In fairness Bangladesh had a famine in 1974 which should be at the least noted. There's pictures of mass week long massacre you teenage monkey. Thousands of them. Enough for other nations to think and specifically blacklist some random ruler of a state back then. All these stats Modi is so expert in faking up and all the desi courts giving clean chits will never erase that stain in India's history. Go read the definition of literacy rate in India, it's anyone who can read and write any one language and did class 5 in school. It's way easily fakeable and pointless metric than you think. Comparing GDP and not PPP or HDI especially when comparing with old socialist states like WB and Assam is monumentally disingenious and reeks of whatsapp forwards for unpadhs. Look also into how your stats have fared over the years, before and after 2002. You're practically doing the equivalent of holocaust denial just because you got some privilege and debelopment back by skinning someone else's. >he percentage of Muslims occupying higher posts is also far greater in Gujarat compared to other States. I will give only one comparison. Of the 25.2 per cent Muslim population of West Bengal, only 2.1% have benefited from government jobs. Gujarat with only 9.1% Muslim population, 5.4% have government jobs. zero source. How many Muslim MLAs are present in assembly and parliament representing them from gujrati constituencies? Good points, one more thing i would like to add is he pushed common people for cleanliness to an extent, the effect of which can be seen. And for the con i would say incompetency of home ministry in addressing internal disputes many times, so much so it feels he is purposely letting the matter escalate for voting advantage. I would say the COVID situation got handled pretty well, if you think what could have happened. The density of India is one of the highest with such a big population, can't have enough professionals in such a short period. Kudos to our health care workers. A lot of us did not live to tell the tale. How quickly have we moved on 😐 I think you are grossly misinformed. COVID was a fiasco, period. In the beginning of the first wave, it was recommended by ICMR that we need to set up oxygen plants, because the need for oxygen was expected to increase a lot due to the virus based on global trends. Several of these were commissioned, but their progress was never monitored, and very few were completed. The ruling party had a meeting right before delta hit, in which they congratuled themselves for beating covid. This was problematic because there was sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that the epidemic will come in waves. Hence, a second wave was expected. When Delta hit, even a month before the worst period in Maharashtra, the chief minister had requested support of the centre to airlift oxygen to the state as a shortage was expected. The government did jackshit. In fact, they only became proactive right after the worst had passed (read: most people who could have died, had died). And what it really obscene, is that the BJP IT cell tried a PR stunt by tweeting about all the amazing work the government was doing: started posting photos of ventilators and other equipment that was being imported from the US, and other random things about Modi saving is from delta. My opinion is that given the resources at the hand, it should have been possible to set up the required number of oxygen plants, or at least, mandate medium/large hospitals to set up their own (many large hospital did already have them, but they were inaccessible for most people). The government fucked up. Could another government have done better? Not sure. But this was the government we had, and it should have done more for the lives of its citizens. Rahul Gandhi fan boiiii No one cares about Covid. Not even the en mass cremations or piles of floating bodies could convince how the govt left their citizens out to die and hid critical information, Life is cheap indeed. Disdain for human rights?? Lmao all negative fake Ya, really? How often after 2014 do you hear that someone filed an RTI about some government's faulty work/policies etc.?"
