        "True",

        "Thats not my experience though. Unless and until you are at an expensive place people do treat you differently. They assume you are dirty cos your skin is brown. I have experienced this in Seoul and Busan. Clubs don't allow Indians, Pakistanis etc to even enter.",
        "While it’s highly condemnable that any clinic would give contraceptives to Ethopian women. It’s not sterilisation.what you said is a lie.",

        "I think Mizrahi makes up 50%.  It dropped because of migration from the former Soviet Union and Western countries. Also, Haredim (Ultra-Orthodox Jews) are most likely Ashkenazi.\n\nAshkenazi are 60-80% of Fertile Cresent (which includes Levantine) only on their father's side (Y-DNA). On their maternal DNA it is 80-100% European. So most Ashkenazi Jews are at most 50% Middle Eastern.",
        "People who have been guilt tripped into believing that not liking the state of Israel is akin to anti-Semitism.",
        "No. Ethipian jews are discriminated heavily in Israel by ashkeNAZI jews, who ironically had faced holocaust in the past. Read about the forced sterilizations by white jews on black jews in israel.",
        "This is true in theory but I think many (most?) American Jews take birthright tours and are open to getting Israeli citizenship",
        "This should not be a surprise to anyone. Every report, every survey has proved that Israel is the most racist and bigoted country on earth, closely followed by Borat. Perhaps that explains why Savarna Hindus are hell bent on ling sadhna of Ashkenazis.",

Whether they eventually support Israel is another thing \n\nIn fact 70% of American Jews a lot who took this tour have been consistently pro Palestine and anti Israel for a while. \n\nAnd last I checked it’s the American / Ashkenazi Jews who are the power investors and inventors/ founders and all so how does Israel get to claim superiority based on Jewish people outside Israel ?",
        "Naah, US would have better relations with Arab countries if they hadn't supported Israel. US funded them initially out of combination of guilt and lobbying by political donors... and now because of evangelicals or Jewish donors.",
        "Israel is an ethnostate so it gets to claim all Jewish success as its own. Most successful Jews in America either tacitly or explicitly support Israel, as is evident by this Harvard fiasco. Even those Jews who were pro Palestine in college turn to the status quo as they get older and more successful.",
        "Yeah there was a rage about this on Twitter",
        "They can’t explicitly go against Israel and not support because they are Americans first and Americans have to support Israel no matter what. More non jewish personnel support Israel btw . \n\nAs for Jews “supporting the status quo “ when they become more successful it’s a lot more about fear of losing every thing because we know how American and Israeli govts deal with people who are anti Zionist",
        "Yeah not only Israelis government but Indian embassy is also not giving them any protection guarantee",
        "Idk I’ve spent tons of time around liberal Jewish students as an undergrad and they are progressive on everything except Israel.",

        "Lets be specific. Israeli European Jews sterilized Isralei Ethopian Jews without their consent. \n\nI would love to hear your take on this.",
        "Because the government is pushing for it. \n\nThey signed a deal with Israelis to replace the Palestinian labour who left after the war.",

        "Same goes for Islamophobia",

        "What do you expect from a 'capitalistic' government?",
        "Its less about capitalism and more about morals. This government is immoral at its very basic.",
        "Like when Indian lefties and Muslims came out to condemn when Israeli kids and civilians were slaughtered in their homes on Oct 7. \n\nOh no, they didn’t.\n\nThey came out to celebrate.",
        "The irony is India has the potential to be a global superpower but it doesn't leverage any ability to project power beyond it's borders. \n\n\nHow has China done this? It loans money to smaller nations and helps them develop. Soft power projection has helped China become the 3rd most powerful country (after ISR and the US; ISR controls the US), hence India should be thinking of working with its neighbors and expanding its global reach. ",
        "Yeah that's the difference between welfare capitalism and crony capitalism.\n\nThe latter worship a handful of oligarchs while the former provide equal opportunities to small businesses and adequate welfare for employees.",
        "that's nice. killed the Palestinians, so now they don't have expendable labour any more.",
        "Harvesting that potential requires a meritocracy and India is quite the opposite as idiocracy",
        "Sure Antisemitism is not the same as not liking Israel.\n\nAnd yet literally every single comment criticising Israel here is repeating Anti semitic tropes and blood libel.",
        "Yeah so now they want expendable labour from India",
        "&#x200B;\n\nYou still on about kids slaughtered hoax? From Israeli sources, it's just one kid who died, Hamas is a 'terrorist organisation', terrorist methods work on showing off their work, the way 9/11 was done. Israel itself accepted so many things, and lies. They over exaggerated the casualties, they themselves killed their own citizens in indiscriminate firing.\n\nNow as a leftie, dude the only reason I support resistance groups is because I know my own history, I'm not a sanghi who'd worship coloniser or bootlickers like Savarkar. Most of the freedom fighters were considered terrorists by the colonisers, SC bose, Azad, Bhagat Singh they're all considered criminals. I'm not a dumbass who'll support colonisers, and btw Palestinians have a right to rebel violently under international law, israel doesnt have that because they're the occupiers.",
        "India has a huge class of intellectuals that can collectively transcend India's government and project power abroad. \n\n\nThis is done by unifying, combining monetary efforts, and investing abroad in different countries to improve them and simultaneously develop trade with India (helping to improve India in the process). \n\n\nGlobal trade at its most basic ideally functions on the barter system. Country X has silver, Country Y has gold, so they trade and both benefit. \n\n\nThe problem is in modern times, 1st world countries loot 3rd world countries for resources, using proxy puppets governments.

Bhakts because they kill Muslims. Believe it or not the same people who were saying let's go to Lakshadweep were chanting let's work in Israel a while back when the government introduced this plan. They are so poor that they will have to do manual labor in war torn country but yet so rich that they can afford an ultra luxury stay in Lakshadweep. Please use the Hindu App to access the full text in case your free article web quota is exhausted. Well they are our ally that's fine. But they are also one of the most racist people on the planet. They really do believe in the \"superiority theory\". Most of the Indians are not aware of this but it is. In real world, Israel contributes a lot to global economy. I work at FAANG and had to travel to Israel multiple times over the years. Yeah that's right. The Israeli jews are quite racist There are Jews in Africa and India and they have experienced plenty of racism there. The issue is they are a supremacist state, so any Indian there automatically is treated as a third class citizen. They could be racist, but there’s still a lot of travel for work. True They're not exactly an ally of anyone. Their biggest \"ally\" is the US which they use as a money machine, with zero contribution in return. That should tell you enough about their outlook on international relations. Simply put, people who are ready to subjugate Muslims in India have extreme sympathy with Israel. There’s still a lot of travel to Israel and their importance is not trivial >most racist people Thats South Korea. You have no idea how racist South Koreans can get. Almost all other country pales in comparison. Yeh toh khatarnak hain especially when its conflict zone TIL there is an e-migrate portal When you realise most rich investor's corporates in usa & Germany are actually jewish they are one of most richest breed for ex open ai ceo is also jewish most talented too won many noble prizes in science related things not imaginary piece hence they might have superiority Everyone who hates Palestine Did South Korea sterilise darker skinned people? (Israel chemically sterilised Ethiopian Jewish woman without their consent) Israelis are the most racist people if you've worked with them see their replies to those tweet Indians reply to It's gut wrenching and depressing for that one way love It's like incels trying to impress a girl Interesting that they believe that. Especially considering the fact that they almost got wiped out of existence because of the same belief a few decades ago >zero contribution in return Lol no, they give back military intelligence in return. Keeps the other arabs from developing nuclear bombs and setting it off in the name of some \"jeehaadd\" \"one of the most racist\" is what I mentioned. They atleast provide citizenship to immigrants who come from abroad. In other Arab countries, the discrimination against non-Arabs is enshrined in law which is significantly worse. They don't. What have you been reading? The citizenship is a very strict process for anybody who isn't European Jewish. Even brown Jews from India or Black Jews from Africa don't get citizenship, Jews from South America don't get citizenship. Thats new for me. Seems legit too. Thanks. You do know that Jew =! Israeli right ? Lol no 😂.. Far from comparison. SK has its problems but they don’t actively go out of the way to harm or disenfranchise POC for no reason but race supremacy. Example? Jews from India/ Africa are also called Israeli Jews. I mean if you’re going to racist. At least be more specific. The tweets are fake. Chemically sterilised? 65% of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi. Even Ashkenazi Jews are 60-70% Levantine. Israelis are POC. I can't view the link for some reason. But they admire their roots of Israel But innocent minded labourers who are approaching shady firms and all to get work won’t really get this news first hand that they are going to Israel . That is the bigger issue Thats not my experience though. Unless and until you are at an expensive place people do treat you differently. They assume you are dirty cos your skin is brown. I have experienced this in Seoul and Busan. Clubs don't allow Indians, Pakistanis etc to even enter. While it’s highly condemnable that any clinic would give contraceptives to Ethopian women. It’s not sterilisation.what you said is a lie. A shit ton of Jews especially these prominent ones have been against Israel , so you could never be more wrong The most racist species if i am correct is india's one of biggest asian ally japan the amount of seculasion and discrimination in japan is also high still many people keep on migrating temporarily to japan another one is also south korea racism is almost everywhere but Target of media is always usa because black lives matter Zero contribution? Israel is literally one of the largest military bases in the middle east. That's the entire point of why the US funds them. It's an outpost right in the middle of the middle east. You know an Indian got lynched in Israel ? Now compare that to not being allowed to “clubs” lol they could be mostly against Netanyahu and his policies in reality there was a long protest against him whole yr in Israel itself against govt I think Mizrahi makes up 50%. It dropped because of migration from the former Soviet Union and Western countries. Also, Haredim (Ultra-Orthodox Jews) are most likely Ashkenazi. Ashkenazi are 60-80% of Fertile Cresent (which includes Levantine) only on their father's side (Y-DNA). On their maternal DNA it is 80-100% European. So most Ashkenazi Jews are at most 50% Middle Eastern. People who have been guilt tripped into believing that not liking the state of Israel is akin to anti-Semitism. No. Ethipian jews are discriminated heavily in Israel by ashkeNAZI jews, who ironically had faced holocaust in the past. Read about the forced sterilizations by white jews on black jews in israel. This is true in theory but I think many (most?) American Jews take birthright tours and are open to getting Israeli citizenship This should not be a surprise to anyone. Every report, every survey has proved that Israel is the most racist and bigoted country on earth, closely followed by Borat. Perhaps that explains why Savarna Hindus are hell bent on ling sadhna of Ashkenazis. Many Indian RW want to go to Israel to fight the “common” enemy, so they should ideally do it free and for a cause without any perks. They get paid and free tours irrespective of what they feel so many take it . Whether they eventually support Israel is another thing In fact 70% of American Jews a lot who took this tour have been consistently pro Palestine and anti Israel for a while. And last I checked it’s the American / Ashkenazi Jews who are the power investors and inventors/ founders and all so how does Israel get to claim superiority based on Jewish people outside Israel ? Naah, US would have better relations with Arab countries if they hadn't supported Israel. US funded them initially out of combination of guilt and lobbying by political donors... and now because of evangelicals or Jewish donors. Israel is an ethnostate so it gets to claim all Jewish success as its own. Most successful Jews in America either tacitly or explicitly support Israel, as is evident by this Harvard fiasco. Even those Jews who were pro Palestine in college turn to the status quo as they get older and more successful. Yeah there was a rage about this on Twitter They can’t explicitly go against Israel and not support because they are Americans first and Americans have to support Israel no matter what. More non jewish personnel support Israel btw . As for Jews “supporting the status quo “ when they become more successful it’s a lot more about fear of losing every thing because we know how American and Israeli govts deal with people who are anti Zionist Yeah not only Israelis government but Indian embassy is also not giving them any protection guarantee Idk I’ve spent tons of time around liberal Jewish students as an undergrad and they are progressive on everything except Israel. It's not fake, I follow many israeli people in some gaming communities and some of them do not view Indians in good way. Liberals are still conservatives tho That's that's disappointing they won't be aware of the fine print THEY DONT LMFAOOOO Yes a lot I have no idea what that means That's true. Yeah that's very dangerous when no government wants to take responsibility for workers. Even trade unions are against it. Yes. It's helpful for the ECR passport holders who are ironically not educated enough to understand the devil in the details Don't spread lies Trade unions were always garbage lead by mostly intellectuals who do not know actuality the deal must never be scrapped its just govt have to ensure security of indians there this time govt is wrong but Israel is not unsafe for workers likr saudi arabia I think i didn't heard much about labour abuse in israel unlike middle eastern countries where it's rampant The deal is a death sentence until the Indian government take some responsibilities May be send those sanskari rapists if anyone without insurance or protection It's India, nobody knows or cares about anti semitism. IT's simply islamophobia, bhakts are wanking over dead kids because they're muslim (NOT AN EXAGGERATION) A large percentage of those accounts are bot accounts. Take a wild guess who runs them. I just hope all the sanghis go to israel, they deserve this sooo much why the hell are Indians going for Israel jobs? esp at this time Don’t tell me it’s Pakistan. Lets be specific. Israeli European Jews sterilized Isralei Ethopian Jews without their consent. I would love to hear your take on this. Because the government is pushing for it. They signed a deal with Israelis to replace the Palestinian labour who left after the war. They sure are excited about it. But they don't know Indian government hasn't got their back. Same goes for Islamophobia India has no allies. What do you expect from a 'capitalistic' government? Its less about capitalism and more about morals. This government is immoral at its very basic. Like when Indian lefties and Muslims came out to condemn when Israeli kids and civilians were slaughtered in their homes on Oct 7. Oh no, they didn’t. They came out to celebrate. The irony is India has the potential to be a global superpower but it doesn't leverage any ability to project power beyond it's borders. How has China done this? It loans money to smaller nations and helps them develop. Soft power projection has helped China become the 3rd most powerful country (after ISR and the US; ISR controls the US), hence India should be thinking of working with its neighbors and expanding its global reach. Yeah that's the difference between welfare capitalism and crony capitalism. The latter worship a handful of oligarchs while the former provide equal opportunities to small businesses and adequate welfare for employees. that's nice. killed the Palestinians, so now they don't have expendable labour any more. Harvesting that potential requires a meritocracy and India is quite the opposite as idiocracy Sure Antisemitism is not the same as not liking Israel. And yet literally every single comment criticising Israel here is repeating Anti semitic tropes and blood libel. Yeah so now they want expendable labour from India &#x200B; You still on about kids slaughtered hoax? From Israeli sources, it's just one kid who died, Hamas is a 'terrorist organisation', terrorist methods work on showing off their work, the way 9/11 was done. Israel itself accepted so many things, and lies. They over exaggerated the casualties, they themselves killed their own citizens in indiscriminate firing. Now as a leftie, dude the only reason I support resistance groups is because I know my own history, I'm not a sanghi who'd worship coloniser or bootlickers like Savarkar. Most of the freedom fighters were considered terrorists by the colonisers, SC bose, Azad, Bhagat Singh they're all considered criminals. I'm not a dumbass who'll support colonisers, and btw Palestinians have a right to rebel violently under international law, israel doesnt have that because they're the occupiers. India has a huge class of intellectuals that can collectively transcend India's government and project power abroad. This is done by unifying, combining monetary efforts, and investing abroad in different countries to improve them and simultaneously develop trade with India (helping to improve India in the process). Global trade at its most basic ideally functions on the barter system. Country X has silver, Country Y has gold, so they trade and both benefit. The problem is in modern times, 1st world countries loot 3rd world countries for resources, using proxy puppets governments. This has caused global instability. >India has a huge class of intellectuals that can collectively transcend India's government and project power abroad. No doubt it does. But they are not in power and those in power are not listening to them. Raghuram Rajan advised Sitaraman to buy long term oil futures in 2019 when they were trading near zero during recession. We could have enjoyed cheap oil for years. But she paid no attention to him. >The problem is in modern times, 1st world countries loot 3rd world countries for resources, using proxy puppets governments. This has caused global instability. That's exactly why Africa is so poor despite having the most resources. Capitalism in a nutshell means 'you care more about the rich & powerful ' than the like of us, 'peasants'. 'Welfare capitalism ' - You mean socialism? ISR Just one kid died? Wow!! Where do I start? What you said is a blatant lie which has been debunked many times over. Do you know about the people killed on oct7 in the kibbutz. The area attacked by Hamas was not occupied territory, it was part of Israel within the 1948 UN mandate. Gaza has not been occupied since 2005. All so do you know who the people killed in Oct 7th were? Some of the most liberal people in Israel. Some of them like Vivian Silver who devoted her entire life to peace with the Palestinians and was a board member of B’tselem one of the biggest anti occupation organisations in Israel. It’s quite clear you know next to nothing of this conflict, except conspiracy theories spread by antisemites in the internet. If you think Jews can be killed with impunity and they’re going to not respond, then yeah, prepare to be surprised. Not sure what you’re talking about. I have several Israeli friends who live in Israel. They are neither racist nor have any feelings of superiority over others. I know a few Cambodian students who spent years studying in Tel Aviv and other places, they found people to be kind, generous and helpful. Who cares? Indian gobirment doesn't have anyone's back unless you're a bigshot industrialist. kam se kam yahan se toh gandagi saaf hogi He is very much Indian If they are going to a conflict zone, they should get the other country to bear these responsibilities. At any rate, these are semi-skilled or unskilled jobs for short durations. Isarel needs cheap labour, and they should bear the burden. BASED TAKE, I really feel this is the way to a stronger india in terms of geo politics Let them go, less poison in our country the better Yeah, I've heard the SAME argument form English when they hanged Indian revolutionaries. SETTTLER COLONIALISM IS BAD. but ofc sanghis can't understand that, they've been sucking yt dick since way too long Yo boys lets go and die 😅🥰😍. Note : this is scarcarsm Scarecasm. Surprisingly many are ready to go It's shameful how low politicians can stoop for votes But these uneducated labourers have no idea our government hasn't got their backup That you think I’m a Sanghi shows how clueless you are. I’m against the occupation in the West Bank and so are plenty of Israelis. But if you think killing Israelis will achieve peace, it won’t, it will perpetuate the same cycle of violence going on for decades . It will embolden settlers and far right parties in Israel even more. Hamas does not recognise Israel. There is no concept of occupied territories for Hamas as it considers all of Israel as occupied and wants the complete annihilation of Israel and its 6 million population. The creation of Israel and the colonial occupation by the British of India are not the same. The article below is quite well written. China started to loan to smaller country on 2014. It more like culture and thinking mindset. Any Indian with a shred of self respect shouldn't go for this if Israel can't even guarantee some of those basic things The sad thing is the labourers can't read the fine prints. > It loans money You can only do that IF/ONCE you have money, (or be born into a legacy system, i.e. Western post-Colonialism benefits era). China did it because first they made money. India/ians seem to jump to the end stage projections, ignoring the middle steps that are the real crux/hard-thing to do. Mandatory contraceptive injections effectively amounts to forced sterilization. Ahh,yes. The famously rational Arab countries with very good human rights records that certainly do not cause any trouble and have a very high tech economy. You will be surprised but Indians work in all kinds of places, including some very dangerous countries. Mad respect to nurses from Kerala especially Oh so what Indira Gandhi did in her era? Sterilising lacs of poor men and women in a bid to control population. Also it's pretty unsavoury to label an entire ethnicity as an evil entity who were their biggest victims.. And don't give me the crap that they were the victims and then they did this ir that. Nothing justifies that, it's cheap and crass, quite popular with all the left Liberals these days. Many, many people lmao. People hate Netanyahu, not Israel I know Indian origin jews in Israel personally and I have never heard them say this. I wont deny it happens however, i am sure no one can escape it no matter where in the world I see little has changed since Indians signed contracts to work on plantations in Suriname to replace the black slaves. Except that was a myth that’s been debunked… TLDR - no evidence showing this happened, falsified evidence used to support this theory, strong evidence it didn’t happen. Most of the shit you read online about Israel is bullshit propaganda. Not surprising with 1 billion Arabs posting vs 10 million Jews. You’ve never been to Israel, gtfo with your Israel hating bs. Seen you lie multiple times in this thread already…. First answer my question Does the government provide insurance to Indian workers? Then gtfo Yes this is modern slavery. Read marxs distinction on welfare capitalism and socialism please . One is a liberal backed system. Sweden for eg is not socialist . It's a market economy . There government literally had to issue a clarification. This is group is all commies ffs Do you have any sources for your claims? Can you prove there is no racism against non white Jews. Otherwise your statement can't be proven. Because there is tons of evidence of discrimination Yes, it does, you lying idiot. Does the Indian government give Indians insurance? Doubt it. The article says Israel doesn’t offer the coverage normally given for conflict zones… because it isn’t one. The conflict is in Gaza, and Hamas doesn’t have the resources left to terrorize, let alone invade Israel. Hamas doesn't recognise Israel, and it's not wrong. It doesn't want to annihilate jews, it wants one state, equal rights for all, now do you wanna take a guess who's against that solution? By what logic israel has any moral validity? If they wanted a state, divide Germany and give it to them. Why impose it on Palestinians. Oh because USA wants a proxy power in the ME. And OMG! Israelis are against the illegal settlements? How noble of them. Sure they've occupied entire Palestine, but they've left west bank for them!! Should they be given nobel for their nobility. Oh and let's ask about colonisation from the mouthpiece of another settler colonial state, which is built upon the genocide of natives. You're a genius aren't you? These same people who lied about Iraqi WMD and killed more than 1 M iraqis, started Vietnam war, first encouraged, nurtured Taliban and then fought against it, destabilised almost entire South America... is there any better authority on this? Oh and the gist of your answer, resisting is wrong, no dude resisting injustice is the moral duty of every person. Source on Indian leftists celebrating October 7th? Even with the threat of war, being a laborer in Israel>>>being a laborer in India There are like 50 such countries, why only object to Israel Fake news You speak as if daily wage labourers in India are treated well in India. Better to be treated like a 2nd class citizen in Israel than be treated like an animal in India. At least they won't have to sleep on the streets anymore, a massive improvement in QOL for them, plus they'll be sending back money as well. Kerala is a lot like that i think Well unemployment is rising dangerously in India and Israel either killed or drove away their cheap labour. Plus they are confident they'll have lots of space to house the workers. Sort of a win-win for both parties \" Welfare capitalists went to great lengths to quash independent trade union organizing, strikes, and other expressions of labor collectivism—through a combination of violent suppression, worker sanctions, and benefits in exchange for loyalty. \" - So, screw labours much more kindly than the regular 'capitalism'. I was literally responding to one such leftist, before she deleted her comments. I consider myself a liberal. I used to follow most leftists on twitter until Oct 7th. I was disgusted by most of their comments and had to unfollow most of them. If you don’t believe me, search for posts by Sharjeel Usmani, Swara Bhaskar , etc or your favorite leftist on Oct 7th. The harsh truth is India doesn't have the money to do so. You made the claim dude. Please give me a post by Swara Bhaskar (or another person you describe as leftist) celebrating October 7th. Can’t be a****. Feel free not to believe me. LOL, that's a nice excuse. Yeah we are khatron ke khiladi That country is the topic of discussion for the thread. Yeah there is a reason why there is a huge queue outside the North Korean, Cuban and Venezuelan embassy To earn money. India has high unemployment rate and even people who are employed get very less salaries. I don't know man rather go to gulf Israhel is a active war zone no one knows when Iran Or Hezbollah ( both have rockets which can reach Israheli capital city unlike hamas ones) will unleash their missiles. Everything can happen from Bus bombing to hotel bombing not a good place to be at. Google is your friend. every capitalist shithole is The person who makes the claim has to provide the proof. More like the palestinians started a war they couldn't win A lot of people Frr Wrong priorities Tell me you know nothing about israel without telling me you know nothing about israel Ahh yes not bending over backwards for muslims = islamophobia an active* Israel* go back to school please 🤡🤡🤡 They're one of the few real allies of india more like someone history of conflict started in 7th Oct. Do the ones that go to gulf get such rights in those countries ? That sentence didn't make any sense whatsoever. Kindly go back to school and learn how to form a coherent sentence. he can’t bcz he doesn’t have any proof or source. These are the people for whom history of the conflict started on 7th Oct and they like people to believe that Israel is doing all this as an act of self defence. They just want to satisfy their inner ego and self bigotry by stating it as an act of self defence They get all the costs covered by the contractor. But the labourers have to pay back the cost from salary. So how would a labourer's life in Israel different from gulf? yeah sure come let’s go back together. You learn history and i’ll learn english. Miss Grammar Nazi How is that relevant I'm already good in history. You're the only one who needs to go back to school. yeah ur comment shows how much u r good at history. Yeah and your comment shows your language proficiency🙂🙂 Haha. Let them go and get the taste. Only a fool would wanna go to a near Nazi state. ohh no didn’t know that this thread was about discussion on english language rather than labour laws in Genocidal friendly country. Once an apartheid always an apartheid I know much much more about this conflict than you. A lot of leftists did cheer the terror attacks on Oct 7th. The problem with the Indian left is half of you aren’t even leftists ( You are right wing Islamists who pretend to be leftists) , the other half can only think in binary. Somebody has to be wrong , somebody has to be right, and the weaker person is always right. The world doesn’t work that way. Many Indian RW are sitting cushy abroad Yeah man. I think these folks who love socialism so much, they should be provided one time, express permanent immigration to the 'socialist' nation of their choice."
