        "Kohrra is a bad series. It is over hyped by Netflix, critics & influencers. It is basically a 90 minutes long story expanded into a 6 episoder. Crime Patrol can do better job at telling such stories in 60 minutes.",
        "Millennium Actress was average. But the way the story is told was interesting.",
        "By Indian standards, it's good. Finally, we have anti-Baghban series where toxic parents are shown without any filters. Everyone should show this series to their parents.",
        "Watch Kaalkoot. A very good series and great acting throughout.",
        "Started watching Foundation and binged the first season. Lost interest after 3 episodes into season 2.",
        "You have said lots of words but nothing specific abou what makes it's a bad series. If you want others to take your opinion seriously, try to be more articulate.",
        "Have been enjoying Fullmetal alchemist lately the story writing on this anime is very spot on!!",
        "Recently rewatched Pig (2021) starting Nicholas Cage. This film is like a breath of fresh air. It is so much better than many films of the past two years.",
        "So you recommend it?",
        "I think it's worth watching. Excellent performances, competent direction, great cinematography and some good songs by Wazir Patar. Don't expect a murdery mystery, but an examination of human behaviour. It's not a masterpiece like Paatal Lok, but every series can't be.",
        "Oh",
        "> articulate\n\nMaybe you should articulate deez nuts",
        "Did anyone not like MI 7 Dead Reckoning Part 1\n\nIts first half was 10/10 but the last half was 0/10.",
        "I thought it was good too. That said, I can’t help but feel so exhausted by all the buddy-cops-solving-crime-in-rural-India genre. Kohra, Dahaad, Kalkoot… It’s an epidemic.",
        "Just finished watching Sharp Objects, very interesting and bingeWorthy",
        "Honestly, this is exactly what I've been thinking lately. In a short time period, man cop-related mini series have been released!\n\nAlthough, I have not reached a point where I'm done with viewing this stuff.",
        "I was already losing interest in Foundation during season 1... tried to watch S2, but could not bring myself to it.\n\nWhich is weird because I like science fiction, but this just feels boring. Like Westworld.",
        "I watched it. I agree that the first half was better but the second half may have felt underwhelming because there is little drama and character development and its largely packed with action scenes. I'm thinking Part 2 might make up for it.",
        "Thanks, I'll give it a shot",
        "Yes. It jumped the shark when they went from math based predictions to turning the guy into a levitating structure.",
        "> Kaalkoot\n\nThat looks interesting.  Do you know where I can see it from the US?",
        "Watched it Lincoln lawyer season 2.  Didn't have the punch it did in season 1. Maybe it set up for high expectations.\n\nWatched Guardians of the galaxy ( too late I know) it was a complete entertainer.  Such an emotional movie. It turned on the water works for me lol."
