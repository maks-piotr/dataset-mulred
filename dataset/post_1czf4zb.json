Hence, even though KL is densely populated, it's distributed kind of evenly among multiple cities & towns, which improves the overall living standards and decreases the congestion in cities! Hence, 3 cities from KL in this list. Indian govt should come forward in building more cities or seperation of the state capital with it's economic capital, so that more cities will bloom which will result in even distribution of population to an extend.",
