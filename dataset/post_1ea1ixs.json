        "past tense",
        "Indexation accounts for inflation in cost of acquisition of an asset. Say you bought something for Rs. 100 today and hold the asset for 10 years. Assuming an average inflation rate of 6%, the cost of acquisition will be 179 after 10 years.  \n\nNow say you sell it for 250 after 10 years. With indexation you'll be making a profit of 71 on which 20% tax was applicable, amounting to 14.2. Without indexation, your profit will be 150 on which 12.5% tax amounts to 18.75. So now you're paying more tax. Increase the number of years of holding, and see the gap rise dramatically in tax paid. Say for 20 years and 450 selling price the taxes will be 25.8 and 43.75 respectively.",

        "It is the absolute correct calculation. \n\nSource: https://tax2win.in/guide/cost-inflation-index\n\nCheck the section \"How to Calculate Cost Inflation Index\". \n\nAccording to this, if you acquired a property for 20 lakh in 2005-06, your indexed cost in 2023-2024 would be about 59.5 lakh. \n\nIf I assume an inflation rate of 6% and a period of 19 years (2024 - 2005 = 19 years), the property cost would be 60.5 lakh. \n\nSo nearly the same. This is why I used an inflation rate of 6%.",

        "I agree and understand",
        "People here don’t want to hear it, but, that never made any sense.\n\nAlmost no other country in the world gives you ability to subtract inflation out of your returns before taxes.\n\nAnd long term capital gains is 12.5%, India has one of the lowest capital gains tax in the world of any large country. \n\nEvery country in the world is increasing capital gains tax, as it mainly impacts the rich. \n\nIndia has the right idea, lower income taxes and higher capital gains tax (even India’s “high” capital gains tax is nowhere near global average for large countries).\n\nBiggest issue is sales tax, upto 28% GST is insane. Largest GST tax bracket needs to be less than 15%, with most items taxed less than 10%",

        "You're right. Sales taxes are really high in India and not just GST but on fuel too. For example, the US has 2.9 to 7.25% sales tax depending on the state. As for capital gains, LTCG is 0 below certain level of total income. If we are going down that road, then we can't compare on an apple-to-apple basis.  \n\n\nYou can't take away an advantage without providing others. If it's about taxing the rich, make LTCG applicable over a certain income threshold and not on a blanket basis. As lot of retailers are joining in for whom their capital gains will be a sizeable portion of their total income which overall may be low to begin with.",
        "India also has a higher inflation rate. Look at the US capital gains tax, the exemptions relative to income is much higher.\n\nThe companies are already getting a lot of benefits, they're able to write-off so many expenses. But a middle class and upper middle class person has to pay a lot in income tax plus taxes on investments while inflation is eating their returns also.\n\nSalaried employees are regularly overexploited at work too. Look at the stagnating salaries. And the worst part is, we aren't getting anything in return in terms of quality of life.\n\nThe infrastructure is so poor, the roads, air quality, lack of safety, the issues abound.\n\nThe percentage of taxes may seem low on paper but you have to see how 5-10% amount affects middle class really hard because living a normally decent life is expensive and you're not getting anything in return for all your taxes.\n\nThey even tax your FD interest, when the FDs don't even give high returns. They're totally screwing us over.",
        "I might be wrong, but you can check this link as well\n\nhttps://eztax.in/capital-gains-indexation-calculator",
        "So for a 10 lac property bought in 2005 and sold for 60 lac in 2024, the ltcg post indexation is 5.8 lacs. The tax without indexation with 12.5% is around 6.2 lacs. So not much of a difference",
        "> minority appeasement politics.\n\n\"appeasement\" 🤣. So much appeasement that it's the most socio-economically backward community. \n\nOf course, hypocrites like you have zero complaints over BJP's actual majority appeasement politics. \n\nIMO, people like you only deserve people like Modi and Nirmala.

        "Low capital gains taxes devalue human labor and put more power into capital. So, rich get richer, but those that can't invest don't. High indirect taxes with low capital gain taxes are pretty big reason for increasing inequality (though, unrelated to ambani adani wealth which is govt selling govt assets cheaply for private profit)",

Is it the religious right or the economic right or some other right wing? \n\nDo you call the Democrats of USA left wing? If yes, then they have been taxing the poor. Trump being a Republican (right wing?) was the one who provided unemployment benefits which were removed/reduced by Biden subsequently. In Britain, the Labour was known to have increased taxes on the middle class. So, I am not exactly sure what you mean by right wing selling the country to rich.",

We had so much respect for Manmohan Singh, but their cronies and to top it all the allies, have been and are still the most corrupt. Just to name a few, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Karunanidhi. All these have been the epitome of corruption. So much so that even for common activities like registering marriage certificate, or passport police verification, or electrical connection name change, there used to be corruption. \n\nIt has reduced by leaps and bounds. And if you haven't seen it, they maybe you haven't even experienced the middle class problems. So, sorry, never ever again do we need Congress and its coalition.\n\nI guess, I have/had some hope from Kejriwal. Till now, there hasn't been any alternative.",

Had to pay a hefty sum to the builder under the table, which I came to know later that they won't receipt it, but pay it to the Registration department. I remember, it was there during the BJP rule as well and I am really sad about it, but atleast it wasn't so open, and the amount which they used to ask for was lesser.",

Get your children to study abroad, buy as much land you want, do whatever you please to. Buy whatever you want to, Make your relatives rich, have any number of families. Kill anyone you like. Travel wherever you like\". \n\nOffice timings July 22nd to August 12th. Further work time will be announced, until then do as you please. \n\nMost notable moments were the grin on their faces while the money was distributed. It is our government it is our money no questions asked. \n\nTaxed like a First world country and everything we see around is garbage, filth and dirt.   \nEverybody knows nothing will be developed period.",
        "Though the idea that taking away indexation benefit will mean more tax, the example you shared isn't exactly correct. \nAs you mentioned, let's says you purchased a house 10 years ago i.e., in FY 2003-04. Take the CII for FY 2003-04 (Google it): it is 109. Assume you sold it on July 22, 2024. Get the CII for FY 2024-25: 363\n\nNow calculate the indexation adjustment: CII for FY 2003-04/CII for FY 2024-25 * cost of acquisition \n\n363/109 * 1,00,00,000 = ₹3,33,02,752\n\nSo long term capital again in this: NIl (since you sold for ₹2Cr, it is actually loss and there's no capital gain).\nLong term capital gains tax (12.5% on gain): NIL\n\nNow post budget 2024 i.e post 23rd July 2024, \n\nLong term capital gain: ₹1,00,00,000\nLong Term Capital Gain Tax (12.5%): ₹12,50,000.\n\nSo in the example you quoted, you were actually not paying any tax before Budget 2024 but you are forced to pay ₹12,50,000 post the budget.",

        "How can we track what happened with the budget money? I believe the budget allocation should have more transparency than the promise of 1 lakh 50 thousand crores for Bihar made by Modi in 2015.",

        "bro they announced they have no data of employment (I'm not talking about farmers, I'm talking about corporate employees, who they tax every year), you expect them to disclose their weak points?",

        "Yeah, I agree. But, that's the reason the commenter above me said that we need to give the government jolts, so that they still remain answerable. And that makes total sense.",
        "The CM with  ego is jagan (former CM ),not cbn(current CM)\n\nNo party is saint .but the party in power in andhra is much better than previous one",
        "I might be wrong but here's my calculation. using [the same website as in your comment](https://eztax.in/capital-gains-indexation-calculator),\n\nwhen buy for 10L in 2005 and sell for 60L in 2024, \n\ncap gain with indexation = 27.88 L\n\ntax = 20 % of 27.88L = 5.57L\n\ncap gain without indexation = 50 L\n\ntax = 12.5 % of 50L = 6.25L which is 12% higher.

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "From the [Union Budget speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6oZGe_RHdE) I try my best to summarize some pointers. Do point out important things I've missed. - India is a shining exception in global economic turbulence. - The interim budget focused on the poor, women, youth, and farmers. - Focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. - 1.48 Lakh Crore for education, employment, and skilling. - Priorities - Productivity in Agriculture: raising productivity, R&D in agriculture; increasing yield and climate resistance. - Self-sufficiency for oil seeds - Provisioned 1.52 Lakh Crore for agriculture and allied - Employment and skilling: Announced schemes - First timers: 1-month wage to all persons newly entering the workforce (15,000 rupees in EPFO; with income up to 1L per month) - Job creating in manufacturing: Benefit linked to first four years (proportion to EPFO) - Additional employee: Government to contribute 3K per month for 2 years for additional employees (with salary upto 1L per month) - Five-year skilling program for 20L youth. Upgradation of ITIs. - Support of loans upto 10L for higher education in domestic institutions. Annual vouchers to 1L students at 3% interest - Industrial node at Gaya, Bihar on Amritsar-Kolkata corridor. Announced various expressways and bridges costing 26K Cr. Power plant, airports, and other infrastructure in Bihar. - Andhra Pradesh reorganization act: 15K Cr. for development of a capital and support for the Polavaram Project. - 2.66 Lakh Crore for rural development - MSME schemes - Credit scheme for machinery and equipment for industrial MSMEs - Credit scheme for MSMEs in stress period - Other schemes - Rental housing for workers - Critical mineral mission - Digital Public Infrastructure applications - Technology platform for bankruptcy code - Debt recovery tribunals - Urban Development: transit-oriented development, urban housing, water supply and sanitation, maybe lower stamp duty for women - Energy security: PM Surya ghar muft bijli yogana scheme will be encouraged. R&D in nuclear energy and setup of reactors. - Infrastructure investment: 11 L Cr for capital expenditure (3.4% of GDP). Flood control assistance to Bihar and Assam.

Development of rajgir. - Innovation, R&D: Anusandhan research fund for basic research and prototype development; financial pool of 1 L Cr. and VC fund of 1K Cr. for space economy. - Land reforms: ULPIN with Aadhar and land registry linkages. GIS digitization for urban lands. - Capital and entrepreneurship reforms: simplify FDI rules, improvement towards ease of doing business. Budget estimates - Tax receipts: 25.83 L Cr. - Fiscal deficit: 4.9% of GDP (aim to go below 4.5% next year) - Indirect taxes - Simplifying GST and customs - Medicine customers for cancer treatment removed - Exempt custom duties on critical minerals - Reduced customs duties on gold and silver - Reduced BCD for chemical, textile, and electronics industries - Increased BCD on telecom equipment (to promote domestic manufacturing) - Direct taxes - 58% of corporate tax came from the simplified tax regime.

Savings of up to 17,500 in tax.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Announcements made today will take place from FY2024-2025 or FY2025-2026? Ltcg is now 12.5% with tax exemption of up to 1.25 lakhs Corporate won big on this one I guess. Is the foreign tax rate cut 40 to 25 or 40 to 35? Seeing different values on firstpost and moneycontrol. Retail investors lost I guess with LTCG increase. Though, it is needed. Nothing much on Green energy, the fuck is 'model nuclear plants'???????? We need Mega nuclear plants Didi I heard lots of bihar and andhra... I wonder why its 35% Tax slab decreased? sort of, calculating with new slabs and SD mine comes to 15K less than previous slabs rest of the states gaand marao and manipur toh jal hi gya hain, or bihar main 15 bridge ke liye money toh dena padega. I think those are [Small Modular Reactors. ](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-are-small-modular-reactors-smrs) Mega reactors need a lot of capital investment and takes close to a decade to make (not saying they're a bad investment), making it an expensive long term investment, something which requires a long term vision, which is expecting too much from the current government. Definitely unrelated to something that happened in early june... Any idea on how long those bridges will last? Yes since SD is 75000 now you probably saving 25000 more now compared to previous SD of 50,000 * Fiscal deficit: 4.9% of GDP (aim to go below 4.5% next year) this is a standout point for me, not acceptable For traders and investors- in options STT increased by 66.66% and 60% in futures. LTCG increased by 25%. STCG increased by 33.33% What will they mention in the budget about Manipur tho Data unavailable If disappointment had a face 15 bridge banenge aur agle election tak gir bhi jayenge. Andhra Pradesh shouldn’t be provide such an amount of money for capital. The Amaravati city was a already scam. Nirdaya tai Ngl despression ho gaya hai. Can still understand Andhra but Bihar ??? 26K crores like holyyy What was the announcement on real estate? I saw one tweet where someone tweeted something related to tax on rents Nitish kumar!!! To save the Government. They don’t want to take any risk of NDU JDU leaving the alliance Move away Adani and Ambani , this state is now sponsored by tax payers. Increased LTCG, STCG, STT, and biggest blow being removal of indexation and what did they change just adjusted tax slabs lol. Better for the middle upper class to move to a foreign country, at least you can get a decent quality of living. LOL bhai 1.48 lakh crore for education??? obviously they're lying lmfao this country is a joke. If true then in 2014 68 thousand crore rupees were allocated to the education sector and in 2020, 80 thousand crore allocated. In 10 years period, no progress in education, infrastructure (except gift city and highways) is done. IITs me itne hardworking students ki placement reduce hogayi hai. Students who worked their ass off for 2 years. Agar or saari cheezein add karunga toh puri kitaab likhi ja sakti hai iss par. If we see no progress in the education or employment sector this year, then the government is obviously robbing us Because they form the coalition government. So this budget was fully focused on them otherwise their govt will fall. \\*if disappointment was an old woman with no brains and a BA degree Is it really all her though? Feel like she's just the face for the rest of the establishment that also makes these decisions. Hey, can anyone give me a brief idea of how this budget can impact MLD(Market Linked Debentures)? Small Modular Reactors are a buzz word. No one has built one yet and the pilot project in US was closed after it spent double the total budget in preparation phase. We need more solar, wind and hydro.. and we need to accelerate completion of nuclear projects already underway. 20000 interns per company? Bitch home mad or what? If I sold a properly last month , can I apply indexation to that ? Considering that it has now been removed. Or is it effective from today onwards She’s a face for the rest, but also a reflection So what about projects for rest of the states? I wonder is it time for states to press for a minimum amount of money for projects in budget The Chinese did, successfully and apparently is extremely profitable as an export venture for them. Energy needs are increasing day by day and the price of energy is not gonna go down if we are still dependent on fossil fuels. Nuclear is a good medium term solution imo. A slight reflection but definitely not entirely her. Gotta give her credit for being willing to take all the heat though. You can definitely guess what she would be getting under the table to take the heat. She’s definitely not a free punching bag. I would happily do the same if I was her. Maybe you too. openly maska lagaya hai...nothing specific for Railways ? >she would be getting under the table to take the heat. True true.. Kinda like Kissinger. Nirmala Tai has reduced Indexation benefit from real estate sales. Imagine you buy a house for 1 crore and sell it 10 years later for 2 crore. #After Budget 2024 * 12.5% tax on 1 crore profit * Tax paid = 12.5 lakhs #Before Budget 2024 * Assume an inflation rate of 6% * Adjusted selling price of the house = 1.79 lakhs * Profit = 21 lakhs * 20% tax on 21 lakhs * Tax due = 4.2 lakhs Why not acceptable? since it is still too high or you feel this shouldn't be a priority? I thought all the governments around the world are under pressure to reduce their Debt to GDP ratio. this is massive. It will highly increase the black money dealing which is already quite high in Real estate Isn't that only for highways? There are other things being awarded as well. STT was 0.0625% for options and now it's 0.1%. That's not 0.66. Increase in percentage[ (0.1-0.06)/0.06]*100 . That’s 66% Exactly, and remember this is from the same government that waged a war on black money with demonetisation (or was it a war on terrorism funding). This moves basically encourages people to invest in other asset classes. FY2024-2025 You can apply, since you sold last month. However, double check with a CA. Removing indexation is such a bullshit move. Inflation doesn't exist apparently. Fuck this government. it was as low as 3.4% not too long ago, this is the new benchmark now Agriculture and Education have almost similar allocation. Gravely disappointed that education is still not a priority. Please explain what is indexation and why removing it is a bullshit move. Manipur elections ke time pe manipur rebuilding allocation karenge. Abhi zarurat nahi hai na inko. Talked about their free rooftop solar scheme Then covid happened. I have been an avid BJP supporter. But, after this budget, with the removal of indexation, etc. in an already stressed economy where there are layoffs/no pay rises happening across the industries; I think we now need an alternative to BJP. Exactly, it's totally illogical, removing indexation past tense Indexation accounts for inflation in cost of acquisition of an asset. Say you bought something for Rs. 100 today and hold the asset for 10 years. Assuming an average inflation rate of 6%, the cost of acquisition will be 179 after 10 years. Now say you sell it for 250 after 10 years. With indexation you'll be making a profit of 71 on which 20% tax was applicable, amounting to 14.2. Without indexation, your profit will be 150 on which 12.5% tax amounts to 18.75. So now you're paying more tax. Increase the number of years of holding, and see the gap rise dramatically in tax paid. Say for 20 years and 450 selling price the taxes will be 25.8 and 43.75 respectively. Of course. I was just thinking in absolute value terms from my profit that I would lose. Wow, indexation only seems a natural thing to do considering inflation. Now I am more disappointed than I was before. Gonna need lots of uranium fuel and lots of location need to be fortified ...and reactors rarely run at full efficiency If they don't give money for Andhra Pradesh, the coalition will fail tomorrow. These local parties aren't supporting modi for no reason. It’s not a correct computation. The indexation benefits have been very low and not linked to inflation at all. You can check Indian property indexation calculator online. Majority of the people would actually benefit from this. Timed perfectly so others too can have this realisation a couple of months after an election and 4+ years before the next It is the absolute correct calculation. Source: Check the section \"How to Calculate Cost Inflation Index\". According to this, if you acquired a property for 20 lakh in 2005-06, your indexed cost in 2023-2024 would be about 59.5 lakh. If I assume an inflation rate of 6% and a period of 19 years (2024 - 2005 = 19 years), the property cost would be 60.5 lakh. So nearly the same. This is why I used an inflation rate of 6%. Renewables are CSR. Yeah, nice to say that we fed the poor for 2 days but of little practical use. And untill, we know how to store energy at grid scale it will remain so. I would prefer if we keep talking about renewable and developed nuclear and grid level storage solutions behind the curtain. A lot of talk about nuclear makes the people and the world paranoid. If I paid 500 in STT for one trade previously, how much would it be now? Uspe bhi tax dalenge It'll be 800 now. Not for futures right? I think it’s a great idea to remove indexation. After all, India is now ‘viksit’ (i.e., developed) and cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Surat are as developed as Tokyo/ Shenzen (I read this in another sub). Advanced economies have very low inflation as such removing indexation benefits won’t create any issues at all. We need an alternative. Never going to vote for Congress because of its corruption (I can see a repeat of the 2009-2014 Union govt corruption in Karnataka right now) and minority appeasement politics. If I hadn't seen Kejriwal hand-in-hand with the Gunda Raj Lalu Prasad Yadav, I think I would have voted for Kejriwal all the way. Hope he goes back to honest politics. 😔 Or else God help India. I agree and understand People here don’t want to hear it, but, that never made any sense. Almost no other country in the world gives you ability to subtract inflation out of your returns before taxes. And long term capital gains is 12.5%, India has one of the lowest capital gains tax in the world of any large country. Every country in the world is increasing capital gains tax, as it mainly impacts the rich. India has the right idea, lower income taxes and higher capital gains tax (even India’s “high” capital gains tax is nowhere near global average for large countries). Biggest issue is sales tax, upto 28% GST is insane. Largest GST tax bracket needs to be less than 15%, with most items taxed less than 10% Even after the disastrous budget since the past 3 years ,if it was this year you decided that you'll not support BJP anymore then I guess you deserve this government And if you still think that BJP is not corrupt then you are really naive BJP is always going to loot the middle class out of existence and sell the country to the rich. This is the only thing the right does globally Can someone tell me if state govts can directly get loan from international agencies and if so, who is on the hook if they default on the loan? For futures it has actually doubled. You're right. Sales taxes are really high in India and not just GST but on fuel too. For example, the US has 2.9 to 7.25% sales tax depending on the state. As for capital gains, LTCG is 0 below certain level of total income. If we are going down that road, then we can't compare on an apple-to-apple basis. You can't take away an advantage without providing others. If it's about taxing the rich, make LTCG applicable over a certain income threshold and not on a blanket basis. As lot of retailers are joining in for whom their capital gains will be a sizeable portion of their total income which overall may be low to begin with. India also has a higher inflation rate. Look at the US capital gains tax, the exemptions relative to income is much higher. The companies are already getting a lot of benefits, they're able to write-off so many expenses. But a middle class and upper middle class person has to pay a lot in income tax plus taxes on investments while inflation is eating their returns also. Salaried employees are regularly overexploited at work too. Look at the stagnating salaries. And the worst part is, we aren't getting anything in return in terms of quality of life. The infrastructure is so poor, the roads, air quality, lack of safety, the issues abound. The percentage of taxes may seem low on paper but you have to see how 5-10% amount affects middle class really hard because living a normally decent life is expensive and you're not getting anything in return for all your taxes. They even tax your FD interest, when the FDs don't even give high returns. They're totally screwing us over. I might be wrong, but you can check this link as well So for a 10 lac property bought in 2005 and sold for 60 lac in 2024, the ltcg post indexation is 5.8 lacs. The tax without indexation with 12.5% is around 6.2 lacs. So not much of a difference > minority appeasement politics. \"appeasement\" 🤣. So much appeasement that it's the most socio-economically backward community. Of course, hypocrites like you have zero complaints over BJP's actual majority appeasement politics. IMO, people like you only deserve people like Modi and Nirmala. I hope they'll rule India till 2039 till your then son or daughter catch some lead in the streets like in Bangladesh. Someone should put vishwaguru's face on this Nope, woh toh free mein milega, bhar bhar ke milega Why is increase in LTCG needed? Mumbai is developed? Have you travelled by trains, seen roads in monsoon? If it prevents people from using property as investment then it's an extremely good move. Property should be used to live in and not as an investment to buy and sell. Bridges bas bahana hai, 50% to corruption ke liye use hota hai. Fuck this budget and fuck this govt and fuck the morons who voted for them. So basically this will encourage black money economy once more. Good. main highlight is medical college, airport, sports and stuff They need to pay the media to attack the opposition and spread Hindu-Muslim hate *75% It seems correct. I computed for my asset as a case study and also got 50% higher tax under new regime for a holding period of 11 years. We won't like the answer but think of it like an indirect wealth tax. Isn't it negative news for real estate and BFSI? I know but those countries are developed economies- and except for last couple of years where almost near zero inflation rates so I think it's not the right benchmark to compare with a developing fast growing economy like ours and say indexation is not required. Low capital gains taxes devalue human labor and put more power into capital. So, rich get richer, but those that can't invest don't. High indirect taxes with low capital gain taxes are pretty big reason for increasing inequality (though, unrelated to ambani adani wealth which is govt selling govt assets cheaply for private profit) > a war on black money with demonetisation (or was it a war on terrorism funding). It was just a gimmick, unfortunately. I guess it kind of makes sense, but it's still not easy to digest. Especially since we get jackshit in return for paying all this. Mope all you can, but sorry, I don't support uplifting the already uplifted. I am all in for supporting/uplifting the actually downtrodden or the economically backward sections. And which minority are you talking about which is the most socio-economically backward? And if even after all the \"appeasement\" done till now; if there's still a problem, then the issue lies elsewhere? We should push for lower indirect taxes and higher taxes on higher slabs. Wealth and inheritance taxes can work, but they need to focus on extremely wealthy not middle class from cities. Let's agree to disagree. Right wing is a diluted term as of now. Not sure which right you are referring to. Is it the religious right or the economic right or some other right wing? Do you call the Democrats of USA left wing? If yes, then they have been taxing the poor. Trump being a Republican (right wing?) was the one who provided unemployment benefits which were removed/reduced by Biden subsequently. In Britain, the Labour was known to have increased taxes on the middle class. So, I am not exactly sure what you mean by right wing selling the country to rich. Dude you vote for Congress and if they don't work, kick them out for BJP again. Keep changing the government and they will put in some work. No matter who the party is, they will put in some work. BJP is far less corrupt than Congress. Sorry, but, you seem to be a young person who hasn't seen the Congress days. We had so much respect for Manmohan Singh, but their cronies and to top it all the allies, have been and are still the most corrupt. Just to name a few, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Karunanidhi. All these have been the epitome of corruption. So much so that even for common activities like registering marriage certificate, or passport police verification, or electrical connection name change, there used to be corruption. It has reduced by leaps and bounds. And if you haven't seen it, they maybe you haven't even experienced the middle class problems. So, sorry, never ever again do we need Congress and its coalition. I guess, I have/had some hope from Kejriwal. Till now, there hasn't been any alternative. Do you think so? Karnataka, where I am currently staying, voted for Congress. But, it has deteriorated to a worse point. I had bought a house, and needed to get the registration done. Had to pay a hefty sum to the builder under the table, which I came to know later that they won't receipt it, but pay it to the Registration department. I remember, it was there during the BJP rule as well and I am really sad about it, but atleast it wasn't so open, and the amount which they used to ask for was lesser. But, I do hear your point! What you are saying is to keep the government on its toes so that they don't take us for granted! But, if the cost is bringing back Congress, I am really really afraid! Keeping one party in power means they keep getting progressively worse and arrogant. Keep changing them to keep them at bay. Dude there is nothing left to do here. BJP is turning out to be multitudes worse than congress by legalising corruption instead of open corruption. Haha! That's a good take! But, atleast that money will then be audited, and they atleast need to be answerable for it; as against the money directly going in the pockets of the politicians. But, I do hear you! But, still implore on whether you really want Congress again! And that's why coalitions are good. What scam ?? It's a strategic location....The state literally got shafted during state divide and got peanuts till now... Amaravti is located between 2 cities(kinda like delhi) ...so when it grows it will be a much larger city than currently.. At this point, I would say a Civilization VI player with more than 600 hrs in-game time can create a much better budget policy than what Nirmala has made. What I saw was Government distributing money to their new Alliance. Watching budget was so cringe it was like \"take your shares and distribute it among yourselves, We have all these money running around collected from people, they wont mind if you don\\`t spend on them. Now take these money in the name of development and make yourself invisible for the rest of the government term. Get your children to study abroad, buy as much land you want, do whatever you please to. Buy whatever you want to, Make your relatives rich, have any number of families. Kill anyone you like. Travel wherever you like\". Office timings July 22nd to August 12th. Further work time will be announced, until then do as you please. Most notable moments were the grin on their faces while the money was distributed. It is our government it is our money no questions asked. Taxed like a First world country and everything we see around is garbage, filth and dirt. Everybody knows nothing will be developed period. Though the idea that taking away indexation benefit will mean more tax, the example you shared isn't exactly correct. As you mentioned, let's says you purchased a house 10 years ago i.e., in FY 2003-04. Take the CII for FY 2003-04 (Google it): it is 109. Assume you sold it on July 22, 2024. Get the CII for FY 2024-25: 363 Now calculate the indexation adjustment: CII for FY 2003-04/CII for FY 2024-25 * cost of acquisition 363/109 * 1,00,00,000 = ₹3,33,02,752 So long term capital again in this: NIl (since you sold for ₹2Cr, it is actually loss and there's no capital gain). Long term capital gains tax (12.5% on gain): NIL Now post budget 2024 i.e post 23rd July 2024, Long term capital gain: ₹1,00,00,000 Long Term Capital Gain Tax (12.5%): ₹12,50,000. So in the example you quoted, you were actually not paying any tax before Budget 2024 but you are forced to pay ₹12,50,000 post the budget. Answerable? BJP doesn't seem to think it is answerable to anyone for anything. You mean /s? Parading religion around like a weapon and promoting austerity and cuts to real social programs while passing laws that enable the rich to exploit the poor are right wing policies. The concept of terms being diluted is also right wing propaganda who want people to believe that there are no Nazis, there is nothing like right wing, that there’s nothing like exploitative capitalism or “everything is racist”. They say these things so that you can’t criticise exactly what they’re trying to do. How can we track what happened with the budget money? I believe the budget allocation should have more transparency than the promise of 1 lakh 50 thousand crores for Bihar made by Modi in 2015. Well, Bihar already had 1 lakh 50 thousand crores promised by the God avatar himself in 2015, 26K crores is nothing but change for them. *\"Jaa toh raha hai JP Singh, lekin pahunch nahi raha hai\"* I don't want to give a single penny of my taxes to go those mónkeys !! Farmers gave their land for development. Many agencies funded the city development. They floated the competition and recruited the people. The CM changed, his ego is more that benefits of people; so he scratched the project. It may be a scam but bruh, imagine 10 years without any developed capital? bro they announced they have no data of employment (I'm not talking about farmers, I'm talking about corporate employees, who they tax every year), you expect them to disclose their weak points? Stop strawmanning. Can you please define right for me? And to the comment above, how has right wing always been capitalist? Yeah, I agree. But, that's the reason the commenter above me said that we need to give the government jolts, so that they still remain answerable. And that makes total sense. The CM with ego is jagan (former CM ),not cbn(current CM) No party is saint .but the party in power in andhra is much better than previous one I might be wrong but here's my calculation. using [the same website as in your comment](https://eztax.in/capital-gains-indexation-calculator), when buy for 10L in 2005 and sell for 60L in 2024, cap gain with indexation = 27.88 L tax = 20 % of 27.88L = 5.57L cap gain without indexation = 50 L tax = 12.5 % of 50L = 6.25L which is 12% higher. So there is a difference. Of course that is unfortunate for the people in Andhra, I do understand this. They have missed so many opportunities. I also hope they have a good capital very soon. Yes, I forgot Mr Naidu was elected recently. He had great aspirations for Amaravati and he really pushed the project. I meant Mr Reddy and his ego. He didn’t wanted Amaravati because then he would be strengthening the former CM’s visions Everyone is all for socialism until the poorest state actually gets monetary benefits from the taxes paid by states that earn more, eh? >cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Surat are as developed as Tokyo/ Shenzen WHAT????????? Nothing Congress has done yet is worse than BJP now 60\\* hours How old are you? 60 hrs is very little. I have seen hard-core players clock more than 300 hrs in game time and a few going more than 1000 hrs. Gonna need some links for that. As far as I’ve read there are 80 projects but none live. Russians claim of SMR stem from a submarine reactor they popped on a barge and floated up in the arctic. It’s just a very inefficient and very dirty reactor >No one has built one yet and the pilot project in US was closed after it spent double the total budget in preparation phase. In the US(uk and the west in general) because of relatively strong local laws, NIMBYS have incredible power to shut down projects and because there is no state backing for the projects, the financing itself becomes incredibly expensive And no, SMR's do exist, they have existed for about 70 years now - in nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, those can be modified for civilian uses,in fact India's own pwr reactor design(ipwr 900) has its roots in a submarine reactor design >We need more solar, wind and hydro.. and we need to accelerate completion of nuclear projects already underway. No, we need an expansion of our nuclear energy industry, solar at best has a capacity factor of ~30%,onshore wind about 35%, and offshore wind is about 40%, compared to nuclear at about 90%there exists no technology today to efficiently store all that energy when sun isn't shining and wind isn't blowing(which is the majority of time), while we can store in relatively small quantities, the industrial capacity Along with the lowest marginal cost of production and the intellectual property is controlled by china, not even Australia - a literal continent sized country with a population smaller than delhi and a gazillion tonnes of minerals has figured out how to go 100% on renewables, their govt roadmap is for about 90% renewables,"
