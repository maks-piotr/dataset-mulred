        "Stay strong, bad times will eventually pass.\n\nThis matter seems complicated. Anything written on a piece of paper is not admissible in court. It should be a contract.  The SP is correct. There is no such thing as a working partner. Either you are a business partner where you own a percentage of the business or an employee.  In the case of a business partner, both have to bear the loss.\n\nAs your father is diseased now, the matter can't be resolved without a police investigation. In India, police do not like these types of cases, because investigation is difficult.  This is also not a cognizable offense, so police do not take it seriously.\n\nThe best you can hope for someone notices the tweet and orders the police to investigate. Or hire a lawyer and file an application under section 156(3) in the district court. The magistrate after hearing your plea will order the police officer to file an FIR and investigate. \n\nYou can also hire a lawyer to file a writ petition in the High court, this will fuck up the police officer's career and will likely involve the entire police department(mostly DCP/SP). This will be expensive for you also.  \n\nGood luck !!",
        "Lending money and working together with others is always tricky and a messy business. When everything is in profits, some people will screw you over. When you are in losses, everyone will try to screw you over. \n\nReading your tweets, from what I can gather, your father lent someone 2L in cash and has a document that states he was a working partner in that business.\n\nInitially these were my thoughts.\n\n1. 2L in cash. I am hoping that amount being given was noted down in document signed by both parties because if not, it’s your word against theirs. \n\nNow I’m not a lawyer so I cannot say how your recordings and witness statements would factor into this if you go to court (assuming there is no legal document). \n\n2.  Just going by the name alone, a partner is someone who shares both profits and loses. Usually it’s defined beforehand how much of the profits and losses you will share in a document. Idk if that is mentioned in your document. \n\nJust to be slightly more informed, I asked ChatGPT in context of Indian law, and it also said the same thing. \n\n*“Yes, a working partner in a business in India is entitled to a share of the profits and losses. The specific share of profits and losses that a working partner is entitled to will depend on the partnership agreement made between the partners. The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, governs such agreements and provides that in the absence of an agreement, the partners share equally in the profits and losses of the business.*\n\n*However, typically, a partnership agreement will specify the proportion of profits and losses each partner will receive, which can vary based on factors such as capital contribution, efforts, and role in the business.”*\n\nNow we all know gpt isn’t always accurate, so take this with a grain of salt. **Talk to some pro bono lawyers or just ask in the legal subs related to Indian law.**\n\n  \nFrom what i can tell, your situation seems less than optimistic. \n\nThe borrower will not pay you on his own.\n\nYou either involve someone who can pressure the police or go to court. Finding someone who can apply pressure for you is  lucky at best, court is the only available option. \n\nBut that too seems pointless if the document didnt mention profit/loss sharing. I am not a lawyer, but if you do wil the case and they give you your 2L, but your doc doesnt mention that losses arent your problem, then it's not out of the realms of possibility that they wont file a case to collect their losses. \n\nGather all documents and evidences, find a lawyer and get an opinion. \n\nlawyers can be expensive, but there are a lot of lawyers who work for free or low fees, try asking around. I hear junior lawyers are there waiting to take such cases outside to build up their case history. \n\nand for the thousandth time, **I AM NOT A LAWYER, THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.** Consult a real lawyer.\n\nGood luck 🫡\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kounxqspd09d1.gif",
