        "UCC is dire need for this generation. Anybody who doesn't like it will have to evaluate their priorities, no matter how uncomfortable it is.",
        "Why do you think people are uncomfortable with ucc proposed by bjp",
        "UCC and BJP ucc is different. Most progressives support UCC, what people don‚Äôt support is BJP UCC which is way more regressive",
        "Agreed, but if Miya-Biwi raazi, to kya karega Qazi?",
        "Can you point me to an article, video, analysis, document, or anything that discusses what ucc is being proposed by the progressives?",
        "Do you think bjp started talking about ucc?",
        "Can you point me to an article, video, analysis, document, or anything that discusses what ucc is being proposed by the progressives?",
        "Google. \n\nIt started in 1985 BM (Before Modi)",
        "The only real differences from the BJP's proposed versions would be that progressives would be absolutely against registration of live-in relationships or any interference in live-in relationships in general. Apart from that there might possibility be some difference with how inheritance is defined, since I believe some current inheritance laws treat daughters and sons differently which progressives would be against.\n\nThe main issue boils down to the fact that every marriage should be registered by the government and not be a religious affair; and similarly divorce can only be a legal matter and not a religious one",
        "Ask yourself, would a progressive want gay marriages, inter religious marriages and inter caste marriages done easily or would a conservative? A true UCC would allow all of this. \n\nThe discussion for a UCC has been happening since the 80s. \n\nSadly, a lot of nuance was lost when the Indian progressives focused on the wrong part during the Shah Bano case. Indian history would have been different if that had not happened, and I of course do not support Congress Act of 1986.",
        "It's a need, perhaps, but dire need? What percent of marriages are hindu-muslim? It's almost like there is a vested interest in diverting attention away from education, pollution, inflation, unemployment, corruption, healthcare, infrastructure, lawlessness, global warming, etc - issues far more relevant to the common people than hindu-muslim marriages, polygamy, or triple talaq.",
        "I don't understand why people are even arguing about ucc in this case.. Seems like a bad interpretation of the law..? As per this judge a muslim and a hindu can never marry under special marriage act.. but it happens every day. This case is in the court only¬†because these people asked for police protection to go to the register office..¬†",
        "I think such judgements should be used for removal or demotion of judges.",
        "Arguing UCC here is not completely unwarranted. UCC (in theory) would not allow judges to come up with their own (bad) interpretation.\n\n\nIt's pretty obvious this Judge is right wing Hindu who is using Sharia to nullify marriage between Hindu girl and Muslim man.",
        "Judge need to be dismissed.  He can't pass his own laws",
        "no court/government is telling me who I can and cannot marry - I am a human being and not a doll",
        "If you have UCC, no more need for religion based on inheritance and marriage laws.\n\nThe demand is very much valid.",
        "Talk about a brainless judge. The whole point of the SMA is that personal law doesn't apply. Personal religious law governs people who *want* to be governed by it. The special marriage act was specifically created to allow those who did not wish for marriages to be governed by religious principles. This judge is a blithering moron and if we had a competent legislature he'd be impeached. And if we had a halfway competent court system the HC's Chief Justice would remove him from all personal law cases after a division bench or a SC bench sent him back to law school for some remedial classes.",
        "> \"*Marriage under Special Marriage Act would not legalise the marriage which otherwise is prohibited under personal law. Section 4 of Special Marriage Act provides that if the parties are not within prohibited relationship then only marriage can be performed,\"* the Court went on to hold.\n\nWhat ? Why does conditions under personal laws matter if the marriage is being performed under the SMA which is a separate law ?",
        "We need UCC so much. A unbiased and progressive one devoid of any influence of political ideology.",
        "Nah..¬† He seems to be a Sikh. His name is something something ahluwalia. Search it",
        "He probably has access to some amazing stuffüçÉThough he'll probably issue contempt of court if we ask him to share",
        "When did Religious laws rise above Government laws ?",
        "Then what the hell is the purpose of Special Marriage Act? What kind of twisted interpretation of law is this? This needs to be appealed. Wtf?",
        "It doesn't work like that. Judges also come from the same community of people. It's the educational system & the method of appointing judges is what needs to change. Merit & performance only should be the criteria for appointing/promoting or transferring judges.",
        "I get the sentiment but marriage is a legal agreement, so the government is very much going to tell you who you can and cannot marry. If you're buying into the institution of marriage, you're already agreeing to abide by certain rules laid out by the government (depends on where you live and how archaic the government is). I'd say no court/government can tell you who you can and cannot love.",
        "tbh I'd marry whomever I want to regardless of the laws - it might not get registered but at least it would be a social marriage \n\nMine is a statement about refusing the \"right\" for a govt/court to tell me whom I am \"allowed\" to marry",
        "Yeah some LGBTQ people have been doing that in India, but without registration they don't get the same rights as legally married people do.\n\nTbh I'd much prefer a world where marriage is only defined as you're defining it (something people do for personal/social reasons) and is different from civil partnerships where all partners agree to a legal union with rights & responsibilities.\n\nThat way, people get the satisfaction of saying that they're married, but it doesn't put a damper on the fight to have equal legal rights.
