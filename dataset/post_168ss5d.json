    "selftext": "I ordered a phone for my cousin from Flipkart. We prepaid for the mobile, and it showed an expected delivery date of August 28th. On that date, the delivery driver's status showed 'out for delivery.' Around 10 AM, I called to inquire when he would reach my area because my brother was supposed to receive it. He replied that he would call me when he's near my area and then disconnected the call.\n\nAround 6 PM, I called again, and someone else answered, saying the delivery guy had left, and my product would be delivered the next morning. The following day, I received another notification that the delivery driver was out for delivery. Again, around 10 AM, I called and asked where he was. He claimed to be in my area and said to call when he was near my house.\n\nAfter four calls and hearing the same response, I contacted Flipkart's helpline number displayed on my order page. They assured me the product would be delivered that day. I waited, but after 9 PM, the delivery guy's number disappeared from my product's tracking. I called customer care again, explained everything, to which she replied‚ÄùYour product will be delivered by the next working day‚Äù (in a very disrespectful way), to my every question I received the same response, making me feel like I was talking to a bot. I asked about the next working day, and she repeated the same response. I disconnected the call, feeling helpless.\n\nI then tweeted, and Flipkart support replied, saying they would raise a complaint, and my product would be delivered soon, with a resolution date set for September 2nd. I waited, but on the 2nd, I received no message or updates. No one from support called me. I considered canceling my order, but it said I couldn't. I called support again, and the person said he couldn't cancel it, and the only way to get a refund was if the seller canceled (unlikely since they already had the money).\n\nWithout notifying me, they extended the delivery date from the 2nd to the 3rd of September. This morning, I called, and the person promised to come within 2 hours. However, when I contacted him again, someone else answered, claiming delivery would happen by evening, which I doubt.\n\nNow, if I were to file a complaint in the consumer court, I know it would take around 5 years to resolve, as I have many lawyers in my family. So, essentially, I feel like I've been cheated by Flipkart, and there's no one to turn to for help.\n\nProof: https://x.com/nrvsht/status/1696531976659038374?s=46&t=SA7Ujwb8cih5eirz6pneXw\n\nLesson learned: Never prepay for your order, always opt for cash on delivery, and avoid ordering anything from Flipkart.\n\nUpdate: I called the delivery guy and he initially said he'd come soon, then stopped answering my calls. Around 7:30, I called again, and he claimed he was near my house. However, it was all a lie, and I still haven't received my product.\n\nUpdate: I called the customer care and told them to cancel my order as there are multiple failed attempts of delivery to which she replied that no you can‚Äôt cancel and you will receive your product in the next 24 hours. But luckily my order is cancelled automatically in the morning and refund process is started. Let‚Äôs hope I get my money.",

I had an hat ordered and delivery guy came to deliver but the package wasn't even their. aftera day of not picking up calls the delivery called and offered to pay the cost of the hat, which he only did because it was less amount or else he would have lost his job as tht was wht he said",
        "If there's an exchange then we're on a bit safer side.\n\nEither you can contact customer support after midnight and ask them to cancel the order as it's been out for delivery for more than 3 days which directly correlates to the 3 delivery attempts made clause.\n\nOr you can wait for the delivery guy who will probably try negotiating the exchange very rudely. (If he shows up)\n\nJust keep trying to cancel the order whatsoever.\n\nEven if he shows up, which is very unlikely, just cancel it.",

Usually if you apply for a return, someone will come to check it on the next day, then they'll approve the return.. the device would be taken and as soon as it reaches the nearest Amazon hub your refund is released.\n\nHaven't done this with a TV but with a malfunctioning phone instead. The refund was released on the same day the phone was picked up",

Called many times first they asked me to wait till the resolution date which they increase every day and yesterday when I called they told me that i won‚Äôt be able to cancel the order but as there are already 2 failed attempts of my delivery so on third failed attempt your delivery will be cancelled automatically from the seller side. So today after the 3rd failed attempt i asked them why my order is not cancelled yet to which they said my order will not be cancelled and will be delivered and asked me to wait for next 24 hours. no i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a open box delivery because i haven‚Äôt got any information about it thanks for the information I will do this first thing in the morning thank you Okay I will do it right now thanks for the help I‚Äôll do this right now If a product is on out for the delivery, then you can not cancel the order. Okay. So, there are very less chances of it getting delivered tomorrow. You'll have to brace yourself. But if he shows up... DO NOT GIVE OTP TO THE DELIVERY PERSONAL. Is there any type of exchange happening? Yes there will be a exchange of phone nowadays all phone deliveries are open box since for security issues of soaps and rocks. ig it depends on the seller or check the page once again if it's mentioned. my crocs delivery today had open box for a footwear. maybe ur package is lost or stolen and they don't have anything to deliver and they are pushing. I had an hat ordered and delivery guy came to deliver but the package wasn't even their. aftera day of not picking up calls the delivery called and offered to pay the cost of the hat, which he only did because it was less amount or else he would have lost his job as tht was wht he said If there's an exchange then we're on a bit safer side. Either you can contact customer support after midnight and ask them to cancel the order as it's been out for delivery for more than 3 days which directly correlates to the 3 delivery attempts made clause. Or you can wait for the delivery guy who will probably try negotiating the exchange very rudely. (If he shows up) Just keep trying to cancel the order whatsoever. Even if he shows up, which is very unlikely, just cancel it. ughhh man I think they have did the same thing to me People are still ordering from Flipkart?? I thought everyone knows that it's a ridiculous thing to do First time ordered because the product was out of stock on amazon. BIG MISTAKE ü•≤ Big Mistake never have trusted flipkart It's okay, happens to the best of us. But you've to cancel the order whatsoever. Flipkart will most probably let you cancel the order on 4th after 9:30pm. And they'll initiate the refund process immediately after that. They have to, they are obliged to. IF THEY DONT, THEN: Don't worry, you've made credit or debit transaction then filing a CHARGEBACK is easy on the ground of 'Goods not provided'. I don‚Äôt think I will be getting my product anytime soon. So calling the bank for chargeback will be the best option i think How many times should people be reminded that not to buy expensive stuff from flipkart. Always use Amazon for this purpose. first and last mistake I am surprised ! I am a Flipkart customer for a very long time and never had any complaints. I have bought major things like 2 TVs, ac, washing machine, shoes, phone etc. > INGRAM I too have got a reasonably quick positive result from the consumer helpline. The culprit in my case was Samsung and it took 1-2 weeks and some googling about prices and depreciation rates for household appliances, as well as some legal sounding talk on my part, but it worked. Maybe refer to it as flopkart? Similar shit happened with me. I had ordered a MSI laptop worth 82000. Had no option but to prepay. Delivery boy didn't even attempt to deliver. Just kept delaying. I raised multiple tickets with customer care. They also kept extending the date of resolution. Tweeted multiple times. Customer care would call and say issue will be resolved but did shit all. Then i figured out where the nearest Flipkart warehouse was. Went there and camped outside untill the manager there gave me my order. Opened it right on the steps of the warehouse while recording coz I didn't trust those idiots. All in all just the worst experience. I haven't ordered anything on Flipkart since. I want to order Nothing Phone 2 but the only online retailer is Flipkart. I don't want to give them upwards of Rs.45k. This. Flipkart may have their exclusives but there's no point when the buyer never gets it. Keep us updated.

There's literally no upside in buying stuff from there. Amazon gets my order late as well in some cases.. However, their support is top class. One time the order was of a 150 Rs something book which was one day late and they sent me a 300 Rs gift card. On all the other late delivery occasions the minimum I get is one month extension on my Prime Membership, along with a gift card sometimes. There are only downsides of ordering from flipkart When this used to happen to me, I visited the local delivery hub. Just a warning: When you do a chargeback, most companies will disable your account. Not a big deal in this case but still. You might lose the order history, chat records and all that stuff. So make sure you to copy paste that stuff beforehand.. Just in case When calling the delivery guy he says he‚Äôs near my area and when asked where is your hub I will come to collect my parcel he just says I will call you when I‚Äôm near your area and disconnects Thanks Haha see this is like saying ki I never wear seat belts and I met an accident while driving a car. It happens to so many people that it's best not to risk purchasing stuff from Flipkart these days. But hey, if it works for you.. Good for you Try calling with a different number, as a different person and find out the hub. Wow. And I have literally cancelled an Amazon order 5 minutes before the delivery driver showed up. All I had to say to him was that it's canceled and he drove away without any complaints. Got my refund within hours as well 2 WEEKS?!? Dude Amazon returns the money within hours You are saying Amazon will return my money first and then send someone for uninstallation and then another guy to take the defect TV? Don't think it works that way. No, but it still doesn't take 2 Weeks. Usually if you apply for a return, someone will come to check it on the next day, then they'll approve the return.. the device would be taken and as soon as it reaches the nearest Amazon hub your refund is released. Haven't done this with a TV but with a malfunctioning phone instead. The refund was released on the same day the phone was picked up They cancelled my order so no point now Flipkart se or kya expect kroge ye to normal hai Sachme the timing ‚ú® I think flipkart is preparing customers mind for more scams to come on the big billion scam day Ha ab pta chal gaya ü•≤ Arre subha meri mummy ka bhi courier aya tha andar se pura box damaged tha but facial kit thi to vo Bach gyi or koi nazuk cheez hoti to lg gye hote But the day when someone has any problem there will be no one to call for help. Try buying from offline. Haan, it's Ekart and Cashify, their delivery companies which is screwing customers up. And Flipkart is totally at fault here for letting Ekart get away with it everyday of the week. Keep us updated about the refund too, it should've been instantaneous with the cancellation. That's better than a headache. Pro-tip: Always buy from amazon. Their policies are very customer friendly. Yes I will keep everyone updated about the refund process. Yes It was my first time buying from flipkart only because the mobile my cousin wanted was out of stock on Amazon. Because we haven't had a bad experience, we think everything is fine. And then we get the bad experience and we learn our lesson. Yeah, I wouldn't risk it. Just had a bad experience with getting a defective Pixel 6a. Going through the fight now. It's because of lack of punishment for bad behaviour. It's very tough to get justice and to get them punished for bad behaviour. The rich and powerful always get away with a lot of horrible illegal things everyday. Violence is the only real way to change it. We had no problems either, until now, we had problems. Damn, nice. I got a defective phone from Flipkart and they delayed for a week, sent a \"technician\" and he said everything was A-ok. Nope, I ordered Pixel 6a a few days ago, no open box delivery option. Seems they don't do that anymore, atleast in my area. Don't assume that it's always open box delivery and they always do the right thing. r/flopkart I have started a new subreddit since I couldn‚Äôt find any place that archives all the incidents that people face with Flipkart. Be great if you could share this post on that subreddit. Goes by r/flopkart"
