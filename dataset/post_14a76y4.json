    "selftext": "Every year something like this happens. Sometimes it's teacher's failure to not teach students properly and segregate favourite students from rest of the class and there we go ! Another innocent life lost by failure . Last year when CBSE conducted board exams in 2 terms ,they also decide to experiment student's life by not giving students who failed in 3 subject to regive exam in the same year abd by also changing pattern in end time whereas these students were covid bacth their studies were hampered by covid lockdown . Those students who dropped 1 year for JEE preps and scored a little below 75% , IIT Guwahati in december told that it is reimplementing 75% criteria as if those students who gave exam in covid they were eliminated as if India is coming back to normal. Last year also because students did not get chance to reappear for exam because they failed in 2 or 3subjects , They to gave up and ended their life. People say one exam cannot define you then how was this allowed to happen? There have been some cases also where teacher after 1st term results said in front of class this kid won't pass in 2nd term in front of class that too calling that kid to extra class 3 days before final board exam i,e term 2 whereas he/she was made to prepare himself/herself in class because teacher refused to help. So what's the point of Conducting board exams? When students who should have gotten proper education were made victim to segregation because that one kid in class was given special attention just because that kid was somehow related to school director's grandson or relative and weak students whereas were cancelled from that classroom , sometimes these teacher did not even match the quality of teaching in renowned private school because they were undergraduate and were not good in bheaviour with others because of special kid in class as if that special kid related to school's director or principal is literally defining their jobs. Also what's the point of implementing 75% criteria in JEE/NEET whereas tech companies have clearely showed that wether you are from NIIT/IIT or private or governemnt college you are prone to loose your job. Some parents loose their only child because those chldren fail to see due to final class failure all the years of love and hardwork their parents had put behind them. After suffering seggregation they feel like they don't belong to this society and have failed their parents leaving them to not able to show their face in society. This one upsetting feeling that sinks their whole ship of a beautiful but also full of struggles life and their dreams that was waiting for them forward. \n\n[ ten ](https://preview.redd.it/nndajs8uk76b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33c88a441b18c49dc8bb3f535ba06b30c2cb4223)",
