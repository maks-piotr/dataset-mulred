        "The business model of Zomato forces this unfortunately. They take a very big cut of every restaurant order for \"advertising\" so they are forced to increase prices. Zomato doesn't want to charge their own customers too much and also give frequent discounts, so they take money from restaurants as a commission for orders, and Zomato needs money to run their platform and also make a profit. Or customers would just use Zomato to browse and order directly from restaurant.. and if this was to happen, a service like Zomato wouldn't even be profitable enough to exist, though Zomato adds things like online payment, delivery tracking etc. \n\nSmall restaurants in India aren't savvy enough to launch their own ordering and delivery system, and customers are used to services like Zomato to search for food, rather than search engines. \n\nWhat I'm saying with all this is.. it's inevitable. If you want to save money, contact the restaurant directly. They may not even accept online payment or offer delivery tracking, and it's extra work for you to search for the restaurant and do this, but that's what you pay the extra money for.",

Not to mention the issue of deferred payments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you find this situation annoying, consider using nearby restaurants and calling them directly to place your order. By doing so, you can get the same item at a much cheaper price. However, it is important to note that you may lose the ease of access, customer support, the interactive UI of the app, and potentially even the availability of coupons.

But on Zomato the same item would be priced at about Rs.130 for the restaurant to be able to net Rs.95 on that item after the 23+5% charges.\n\nPricing the items anything lower than that increased ~30% on zomato would be detrimental to the business. Many restaurants decide to increase only by 10 or 20% and consider the reduced margins as an investment for online exposure.",

        "Zomato charges a hefty commission from the restaurants, 25% and above (minimum), plus a lot of the outlets have to pay for ads, thirdly, most of the outlets are somehow \"encouraged\" to give discounts and coupon offers to help their visibility. Given such high costs paid to the aggregator the outlet has no option but to increase price on online ordering platforms. \n\nFood cost, salary, rental, misc expenses, commissions , it becomes hard for an outlet to survive. Either they reduce the quantity of the food supplied or increase price. The cost has to come out of somewhere, and the pricing is not that high that the outlet is charging the entire amount from the customer. The aggregator in any circumstances always wins.\n\nOh and have a look at the invoice generated by the outlet and the amount to be paid to the platform. there will be a difference. The gap in the amounts, where is the invoice for that?",

I am from Gujarat. \n\nIn general, if you're using Zomato and it's Hyperpure service; you should be able find some decent options yourself for eco friendly as well as plastic packaging.

        "As someone who was a former manager at Swiggy/Zomato, I’ll tell you this.\n\nOriginally, both companies had teams that were responsible to ensure that the prices aren’t elevated from what the restaurant actually charges. Once the companies started expanding and onboarding legacy restaurants, the restaurants weren’t okay with taking a hit on their earnings. Depending on the restaurant, Zomato charges anywhere from 8%-30% and restaurants started adjusting their prices accordingly.\n\nOnce every restaurant got hint of this, the companies disbanded the price fairness teams and basically let restaurants control pricing. \n\nNow, with having worked in that industry for years, I know that despite paying Zomato a 20% commission on average, 95% of the restaurants will still make money. The issue came in when Zomato started asking restaurants to run discounts on their platform. Offering a 20% to 50% discount to customers and then paying a 20% commission to Zomato stopped being feasible for restaurants. \n\nIf Zomato took care of the discounts, most restaurants wouldn’t price gouge as much.",

        "I have a doubt on this pricing model comparison. This arises from how e-commerce pitches to offline retailers - increased revenue by selling to customers outside of your cachement area.\n\nRs. 95 here would be some cost + the profit margin. Cost would include the cost of serving the dine in customers like rent for the area, electricity, waiters etc + cost in preparing the food like raw material, kitchen equipment, cooks, rent of kitchen, electricity consumed in kitchen etc. \n\nThe cost of serving dine-in customers should not be applicable for online orders. The cost of the kitchen side is the same for online and dine-in. \n\nDoesn't the amount charged by Zomato act as a substitute for cost for serving dine in? And therefore both online and dine-in cost remain same. The fixed cost for the kitchen side gets distributed across all orders leading to better margins. The restaurant owner benefits from an increased volume of orders.\n\nCan you help understand why it does not works out like this?",

It might be fine to get higher profits, and no issue there, everyone loves more money.\n\nHowever, you are looting customers.\n\nYou talking about this 23% compensation. To sell these x number of foodplates you don't need to spend on tables, waiters, invest in crockery etc etc (if it's not a cloud kitchen). Also, my guess is once you are open to the online aggregators, you are getting more no. of orders at an item/sku level than compared to dine-in only. \n\nNet net, you are clearly making up to this apparent loss, and may be making more. \n\nYou are charging the customers more just 'coz you can.",
        "I know, I have thought about that. In the end it is not practical to follow the method you are talking about, because then restaurants would have to charge less for customer take-aways from the outlet and more for dine-in.\n\nThis would essentially reduce dine-in customers when they can just get it packed and take-away for a little cheaper. Dine-in restaurants best flourish with dine-in customers.\n\nA dine-in customer, at our outlet, on average spends Rs.150 more than a take-away customer, so we prefer dine-in.\n\nAnd then let's not forget about the packing charges. The fancier the packing, the more costly it is. The mediocre quality packing boxes we use cost about 7-12rs depending on the size.\n\nYou will rarely see a local restaurant charge extra for packing charges on Zomato/swiggy, although the international fast food chains always add extra packing charges on top of the increased price.\n\nThen there are the numerous offers we have to keep updating with seasons, events, festivals.\n\nAnother subtle cost is maintaining the online menu. Graphics for any new item or offer, promotional costs, etc.\n\nTo answer your doubts, overall, the cost of serving dine-in is substituted by the packing charges, slightly more accounting costs, and online menu management costs.\n\nIf there is any scope left for restaurants to reduce online pricing it is covered by the fact that, considering our example of Rs.95 the actual online cost should be Rs.131.85. We have to write that in a more attractive pricing as Rs.130 or Rs.129 and thats where the last few crucial rupees go.",

I don't know if Zomato & Swiggy (or) Restaurants are to be blamed for this. Local delivery apps provide less pricing menu comapared to them. I'm no an expert but Zomato and Swiggy has wide network and employees ( delivery valets and staff) working under them , Hence considering Zomato's charges ( for listing Restaurants) , Restaurant's profit , Zomato's inner expenses and it's profit might be the reason for such high pricing compared to local deliveries ( which is limited to only that/those specific cities/towns).",

That’s almost literally the reason for multiple inventions. All pricing must be fair and explained. That’s just our right as citizens of this country.

        "Why the fuck do people feel that they are entitled to free shit? Who do you think is paying for operations of zomato? Packaging? Fuel? Driver salary? If you can't afford ordering in then don't fucking order in. Zomato overcharging is not a scam. It is an extremely common phenomenon in capitalism. The restaurant HAS TO offset the additional costs that zomato slaps on them. Zomato HAS TO do this to stay in business.",
        "No, Swiggy & Zomato will always have the same pricing. If there is any parity between the two platforms, both the aggregators will shoot you mails multiple times, if you ignore the same and move on, they'll either block your restaurant until the same is rectified or do it from their back end. Yes! If you do have a genuine reason behind the difference, say it's a trial product or you're revamping your menu then both the platforms will give you sufficient time  to correct it across both the applications.",
        "Yes, it's 30% and higher now for new restaurants until and unless you own a renowned chain.",

This is the ONLY resturant which we never had any bad experience during Durga Puja. Sometimes I buy from them physically even though they're quite far from my home. Then there are a few extremely good street food vendors and small restaurants who aren't on Zomato/Swiggy too. I don't know why they aren't on Zomato/Swiggy, because their business will definitely do well on those apps given their popularity in the city. I've seen same thing in Kolkata too. Whatever might be the reason, there can be absolutely good restaurants who are not in Zomato/Swiggy.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Is there something we can do about resturants charging more on Zomato ?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Same items, different prices.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Both are OC ( Original Content ) Location: Tunday kababi on ayodhya road. Bro idk i also find the off putting, but they are there for a reason, for profit. Plus you need to take into account that your time energy is also saved while ordering from these apps. Delivery fee is also less agar dekha jaye auto wale would charge around 70rs one side in delhi. Them Swiggy/Zomato will start charging the server fees, app development fees, and there's already a platform fee and whatnot. Here is their thinking - You are in lazy mode - No price comparison is being done Apt customer for mark up. I totally agree with you and don't bother spending extra for my convenience but they have to be vigilant and deliver what is expected of them. Speaking from my personal experiences, there have been instances where I found my food being tampered with and missing some of it contents. 🥲 Don’t order from zomata. >You are in lazy mode To there suprise I actually showed up to the store 😂 If you're lazy then you'll have to sacrifice something, otherwise support sellers who don't rely on swiggy, zomato and be willing to pay them a fraction of what zomato and swiggy charges for home deliveries. >support sellers who don't rely on swiggy, zomato I would but being on swiggy/Zomato is kind of a benchmark for a restaurant being a reasonable option to order from, those who aren't on it might just not be up to the mark, atleast in my opinion. Yeah that happens with me too sometimes, but it is mostly the mistake of the restaurant. Woh khud dhang se nhi padhte and galat item prepare karke bhej dete hain, zomato driver cannot peek inside the box kya hain isme, bill pe agar apka naam and dish hain bas wahi dekh sakte hain. Mere saath hua hain, lekin majority of time they would either send you a replacement or a cashback. You can't. Don't order if you have an issue. They are not doing it as charity. It would be look bad if they charge you straight up 100rs for delivery so the tamper price of the food add in few different fees and then give you discounts to make it look good as package but ultimately you paying them 100rs extra like in your case. If anyone wants to undercut the price of zomato or swiggy it is nearly impossible today and many startups failed in doing so Lastly before swiggy zomato if you wanted something to be delivered at home minimum time for the delivery was 60 mins, so be happy with what we have. The business model of Zomato forces this unfortunately. They take a very big cut of every restaurant order for \"advertising\" so they are forced to increase prices. Zomato doesn't want to charge their own customers too much and also give frequent discounts, so they take money from restaurants as a commission for orders, and Zomato needs money to run their platform and also make a profit. Or customers would just use Zomato to browse and order directly from restaurant.. and if this was to happen, a service like Zomato wouldn't even be profitable enough to exist, though Zomato adds things like online payment, delivery tracking etc. Small restaurants in India aren't savvy enough to launch their own ordering and delivery system, and customers are used to services like Zomato to search for food, rather than search engines. What I'm saying with all this is.. it's inevitable. If you want to save money, contact the restaurant directly. They may not even accept online payment or offer delivery tracking, and it's extra work for you to search for the restaurant and do this, but that's what you pay the extra money for. Yo. Round off? Yes there is something you can do. Uninstall Zomato and go to the restaurant and ask them for a parcel. If you don't like what a company does, you always stop being their customer These platforms are just middlemen, Someone has to bear the cost of it, for platform operations, for delivery agents payments and so on. Don’t buy Just use Dunzo. Especially if you are already a regular at a restaurant, its just easier to dunzo food over. I do this whenever its going to be a large order Great explanation, thankyou. Saved 165 coz the restaurant is just 2-3 km away from my place. Yes you can. Uninstall the app, very easy solution So you answered your own question Yes you can. Get a car. Use the car to get to the restaurant and order your own stuff. Yeah we can do something do go outside and dine like all other countries do. We depends more online which is not good. Restaurants charge more on Swiggy and Zomato for the same item than they would in offline shop visits, as both platforms take 25-33% commission from them. Not to mention the issue of deferred payments. &#x200B; If you find this situation annoying, consider using nearby restaurants and calling them directly to place your order. By doing so, you can get the same item at a much cheaper price. However, it is important to note that you may lose the ease of access, customer support, the interactive UI of the app, and potentially even the availability of coupons. Nevertheless, all these conveniences come at a price. Don't order from Zomato. Select a few food joints around your place and call order and pickup. Unless you are in a place where food options are limited why are you using these apps? I use them infrequently, when the item I want to use is further away and I would prefer the delivery guy to do the driving. Restaurant owner here. Zomato takes a 23% cut on average + 5% GST from the restaurants. So an item that is priced at Rs.100 in dine-in nets the restaurants at Rs.95 after the 5% GST. But on Zomato the same item would be priced at about Rs.130 for the restaurant to be able to net Rs.95 on that item after the 23+5% charges. Pricing the items anything lower than that increased ~30% on zomato would be detrimental to the business. Many restaurants decide to increase only by 10 or 20% and consider the reduced margins as an investment for online exposure. I can say this is an opportunity so develop an app that solves this problem this is nothing new, I have been seeing this for past 2 years. At my location there is a restaurant that sells shawarma...on zomato they have two oprion normal and jumbo, when you order there is no difference in the quantity. I went to the restaurant and asked them they said there is nothing called as jumbo even after multiple complaints on zomato there was no action.. Finally, I went ahead and stopped ordering food and disabled push notification for all kinds of food delivery app. BEST DECISION EVER! I cook food or the maid does it, healthy, learnt skills and when required I go out and its much worth it. They add extra charge on dishes which is supposed to be taken out when offer coupon is applied. But when you order certain amount as max dicount is capped at certain amount and not %age wise , you get more pricy stuff. I used to order from 2 phones/ids and get maximum discount. It still was a bit costly but not by a lot. Believe me once you sit and calculate your monthly expenses, your balls will drop to your knees I think you can use Dunzo so the person goes and orders at restaurants so you only pay the delivery charge which is extra (normally 50 rs if in close vicinity). Not sure though, haven’t used delivery apps for sometime but it was possible till some time back Yes. Not ordering from Zomato Aminabad jaake kha lo vro Now most of the restaurant owners tired from cuts from zomato/swiggy and using own delivery apps or method. Try to find one before placing the order Yeah, learn cooking and stop complaining about it. Yes, you can go to the restaurant in person and order it yourself, so that you get original price. Agreed. But customer is charged gst on dine in so how u calculating 95. I mean I don't think it's the restaurant who is charging more here. It's Zomato/Swiggy who are raising the prices. They do need to make profit don't they? If you want actual prices go to the restaurant and buy it from there. Simple. That's what I said. Dine-in with tax inclusive price at 100 nets the restaurant only 95 after the 5% GST. The customer pays the 100 and restaurant only keeps 95 and forwards 5 as tax. Running a cloud kitchen. Completely agree with you. Would you be interested in forming a sub for Indian Food Entrepreneurs? You can try ONDC based food delivery apps. In this way, there is no middle man who will ask for service charges. You will be talking directly to the restaurant. OP needs to realise that Swiggy Zomato thrive on the lazy/tired mentality that leads to food ordering \"Being on swiggy/zomato is a benchmark for a restaurant being a reasonable option to order from\" --- it is not. To you maybe, but it's not an absolute, that in order to be a good restaurant in terms of food, they have to be on either swiggy or zomato. Zomato charges a hefty commission from the restaurants, 25% and above (minimum), plus a lot of the outlets have to pay for ads, thirdly, most of the outlets are somehow \"encouraged\" to give discounts and coupon offers to help their visibility. Given such high costs paid to the aggregator the outlet has no option but to increase price on online ordering platforms. Food cost, salary, rental, misc expenses, commissions , it becomes hard for an outlet to survive. Either they reduce the quantity of the food supplied or increase price. The cost has to come out of somewhere, and the pricing is not that high that the outlet is charging the entire amount from the customer. The aggregator in any circumstances always wins. Oh and have a look at the invoice generated by the outlet and the amount to be paid to the platform. there will be a difference. The gap in the amounts, where is the invoice for that? Interesting. How are you getting your packaging items from? Yup. Don’t order from Zomato. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Also, do try ONDC if it’s available where you are. Tried it in Kolkata, and food was regularly 15-25% cheaper before even applying discounts. Yep that's a better alternative Would depend a lot on where you're located. I am from Gujarat. In general, if you're using Zomato and it's Hyperpure service; you should be able find some decent options yourself for eco friendly as well as plastic packaging. We also use that and some other local vendors for our packaging needs. Thankyou for your insight. Now I know. >I went to the restaurant and asked them they said there is nothing called as jumbo Damn. >it, healthy Good for you bro. Thankyou, would take this into consideration. Great tip, thanks Go to report a fraud in the restro profile view and select the 'different prices ' reason. Zomato now is filled with ghost kitchens with mid to terrible food Stop using swiggy and Zomato. Go to your local restaurants and support them directly. Always use coupon codes/ discounts while ordering food online Two options Don't order or order directly from the restaurant Call the restaurant and order and go and pick it up. Else, think that a convenience charge has been added to the price and adjust. No As someone who was a former manager at Swiggy/Zomato, I’ll tell you this. Originally, both companies had teams that were responsible to ensure that the prices aren’t elevated from what the restaurant actually charges. Once the companies started expanding and onboarding legacy restaurants, the restaurants weren’t okay with taking a hit on their earnings. Depending on the restaurant, Zomato charges anywhere from 8%-30% and restaurants started adjusting their prices accordingly. Once every restaurant got hint of this, the companies disbanded the price fairness teams and basically let restaurants control pricing. Now, with having worked in that industry for years, I know that despite paying Zomato a 20% commission on average, 95% of the restaurants will still make money. The issue came in when Zomato started asking restaurants to run discounts on their platform. Offering a 20% to 50% discount to customers and then paying a 20% commission to Zomato stopped being feasible for restaurants. If Zomato took care of the discounts, most restaurants wouldn’t price gouge as much. are Michelin star restaurants are swiggy and zomato Yes Go to the restaurant and eat This and generally the potion size of the food is always less compared to dine in or local delivery vendor. So you're technically paying double for half the food. They charge because people are willing to pay, yet they’re not very profitable companies. Instead of trying to control them, you decide on how you spend your money. Zomato cost you 680 you had 10 extra rotis so -100 =580 delivery charges for 4 km they took 25 but come on it would have cost you even more. The restaurant would have charged you around 525 Zomato is taking 55 for delivering your food 4km away I think it's a fair deal. Aankhen hai ya button?? Roti ka rate hotel k bill me 10 hai.. aur zomato pr 20.. quantity dono jagah 10 hi hai.. If you have the patience, contact Zomato customer care with pics of the bill. If the difference is large, they'll refund the difference Even after charging so much .. Zomato still wants a platform fee of 3rs As others said, yes, just go to the restaurant and get the food or dine in. Yes. Dont order online! See dude you are sitting in your room and ordering food. You don't want to go outside and wait till the food deta cooked so it's ok to pay some more..or else just go out. Restaurants charge the same amt which is on their physical menu. The extra amount is charged by the delivery apps. Wait for my startup to launch. I'll end these Swiggy Zomato motherfuckers once and for all. Don't pay then. Simple. Interesting point. I've also noticed that swiggy and Zomato list prices are different at times for the same product. For example, I'm a Zomato gold user and just yesterday i noticed that the list price for one item from the same restaurant was 590 on Zomato and 490 on swiggy. Any reason why that might be happening? Yes. I find restaurants that you can find on swiggy but not on Google maps to be the most shady and worrisome. Im also in the food industry. Would love to join you guys if you want to go ahead and create a sub or some kind of group. Let's do it. Yes, go get straight from the restaurant Another fellow Restaurant owner here & this is just the basic commission being charged. On top of this, we have to provide offers which are entirely borne by us hence we do not have any other option than to increase the prices on Online Platforms. For anyone interested: I have a doubt on this pricing model comparison. This arises from how e-commerce pitches to offline retailers - increased revenue by selling to customers outside of your cachement area. Rs. 95 here would be some cost + the profit margin. Cost would include the cost of serving the dine in customers like rent for the area, electricity, waiters etc + cost in preparing the food like raw material, kitchen equipment, cooks, rent of kitchen, electricity consumed in kitchen etc. The cost of serving dine-in customers should not be applicable for online orders. The cost of the kitchen side is the same for online and dine-in. Doesn't the amount charged by Zomato act as a substitute for cost for serving dine in? And therefore both online and dine-in cost remain same. The fixed cost for the kitchen side gets distributed across all orders leading to better margins. The restaurant owner benefits from an increased volume of orders. Can you help understand why it does not works out like this? Don’t buy food from those restaurants using Zomato. Stop ordering from Zomato & Swiggy Most places on Zomato are shit, and lots of great local eateries aren't on it. my friend runs a restuarant , he says a biryani he sells at his shop at Rs 120 zomato takes from him at Rs 100 sells to customer at 120 + delivery charge to save his margin, he packs less quantity so basically , a customer on Zomato gets less item at higher price 😅 That's how these companies don't go bankrupt With that extra money you can go there and bring parcel or eat I am a swiggy one customer. The items that I tend to order are far cheaper on swiggy than to go in a restaurant and order myself. It's generally in the case of American food chains like kfc , McD and burger King whereas it's expensive for Indian/local restaurant. They charge more for operational costs and convenience. If you are an owner you would have to give commission as well so yeah it's necessary to price up your food. I always prefer to call the restaurant and order for home delivery, even if they don't have free home delivery, it will be cheaper than ordering on Zomato -swiggy +1 10 rumali rotis damn lol r/birthofasub +1 Pick up the food yourself? Order from a local restuarant that delivers directly to you? Zomato and Swiggy both do this. But neither provide essential services. Just take your business elsewhere Yeah. Can go to restaurant and order from there directly. Consumer of cooked food here. I disagree with this strategy of restaurants. It might be fine to get higher profits, and no issue there, everyone loves more money. However, you are looting customers. You talking about this 23% compensation. To sell these x number of foodplates you don't need to spend on tables, waiters, invest in crockery etc etc (if it's not a cloud kitchen). Also, my guess is once you are open to the online aggregators, you are getting more no. of orders at an item/sku level than compared to dine-in only. Net net, you are clearly making up to this apparent loss, and may be making more. You are charging the customers more just 'coz you can. I know, I have thought about that. In the end it is not practical to follow the method you are talking about, because then restaurants would have to charge less for customer take-aways from the outlet and more for dine-in. This would essentially reduce dine-in customers when they can just get it packed and take-away for a little cheaper. Dine-in restaurants best flourish with dine-in customers. A dine-in customer, at our outlet, on average spends Rs.150 more than a take-away customer, so we prefer dine-in. And then let's not forget about the packing charges. The fancier the packing, the more costly it is. The mediocre quality packing boxes we use cost about 7-12rs depending on the size. You will rarely see a local restaurant charge extra for packing charges on Zomato/swiggy, although the international fast food chains always add extra packing charges on top of the increased price. Then there are the numerous offers we have to keep updating with seasons, events, festivals. Another subtle cost is maintaining the online menu. Graphics for any new item or offer, promotional costs, etc. To answer your doubts, overall, the cost of serving dine-in is substituted by the packing charges, slightly more accounting costs, and online menu management costs. If there is any scope left for restaurants to reduce online pricing it is covered by the fact that, considering our example of Rs.95 the actual online cost should be Rs.131.85. We have to write that in a more attractive pricing as Rs.130 or Rs.129 and thats where the last few crucial rupees go. Yes. Direct purchase Just to confirm, is this the same percentage (~30% on an average) for Swiggy too? I agree with you on necessity to increase prices for online orders, but I have noticed a significant rise in prices in offline menu too. I am speaking of experiences I have in Mumbai and Thane. When I compare the prices of offline and online order, there’s not much difference in total bill. Khud jaake takeaway le aao. Damn, i thought offer charges are paid by zomato. Just because they are serving online doesn't mean they won't serve offline. Irrespective of consumer being online or offline, they have to pay the waiters. If you put waiter charges in bill customer will think it's costly and will go somewhere else. Tables and crockery cost water down way too much when you realise that tables and crockery will serve multiple years and are one time investment. Easy to recover even if you charge very minute cost for it. So negligible cost charged. Is there something you can do? Yes. Don't order on Zomato/Swiggy. Go over the restaurant and buy directly. I am going to continue ordering from Zomato/Swiggy fully aware that the prices are inflated, but i am willing to pay for that for convenience. To each his/her own. Making a lot of assumptions here. Pricing of items is done by restaurants.... if it bothers you too much prder from places that have the same prices in or out of the same places. Order directly from Resturant if they provide home delivery or directly pickup ur parcel 📦 by yourself ….besides this no other alternative . Move ur ass and go to restaurant to order it urself, you lazy piece of shiz, This price contains, restaurant fee, swiggy fee, transporter fee, convience fee aur bhi bahut bhang bosada fee No. That’s the business model. Check if any local deliveries are available in your location. Prices there are a bit better compared to zomato and swiggy on there. As per your concern, I don't know if something can be done about it (Although I'd be happy if there is), but in almost every city and town , prices are soo high in zomato and swiggy. I don't know if Zomato & Swiggy (or) Restaurants are to be blamed for this. Local delivery apps provide less pricing menu comapared to them. I'm no an expert but Zomato and Swiggy has wide network and employees ( delivery valets and staff) working under them , Hence considering Zomato's charges ( for listing Restaurants) , Restaurant's profit , Zomato's inner expenses and it's profit might be the reason for such high pricing compared to local deliveries ( which is limited to only that/those specific cities/towns). If the situation is not that bad then maybe try to communicate with the restaurant itself before asking cashback from swiggy/Zomato, because they fine restaurants 100% of the order amount even for the slightest mistake. Something you can do: I call and place orders on the phone, I pick it up myself. I try to order from restaurants that are within 2 kms, so that I can walk. Sometimes, I take a scooter if there is a lot of food ordered. Learn to prepare your own food items at home. The best way. I am a student who has worked with a lot of cloud kitchens,and want to earn enough to give my parents to take care of it,so they can retire and support themselves. I want to learn more about it. Are you starting a sub for that? You’re welcome to join, learn and contribute. If I have a restaurant, and say 10 tables. And my daily footfall is say 300 people. And I want to increase profit, and hence the footfall too. How do I do that? 1. Expand the restaurant, pay more rent for that. 2. If I have some space unused, but 2 more tables to squeeze in there. 3. If I notice I have some buffer between 2 table turnaround time, I either train the staff to me more efficient, or recruit more staff. All in all, I spend more to increase profit if it's offline only. If I go online I pay 23% to aggregators, take a hit per plate, but overall recover that an may be surpass that as there is no fixed cost investment required for this X no. of extra plates. What are you talking about?? have you created one? I ordered 2 halves of a waffle and the bill was 500… and it was soggy as well. Prices are getting ridiculous, atp ima just make my own food What??!! The paneer roll is ₹80 . If thats price exists in kolkata's restaurant then everyone would have uninstalled zomato Zomato charges too much from restrorent owners, 25%, is way too much. Yes you can do something. Want to know what that is? Go directly buy from the restaurants! Zomato, Swiggy, etc are for profit businesses. The price you pay is for the convenience and the time you save on each order. Restaurants are more than happy to serve you if you directly buy from them. Agar next time koi order galat aata hain toh yeh sochunga That is literally their business model. Restaurants pay 40 percent fees to host their restaurants in portal.. You can avoid Swiggy Zomato platform and use service from restaurant directly Order directly from the restaurant. People here literally have the weirdest reason like they’re not doing it for free. Ofcourse I know because I’m paying them but there’s a line between provision of services and straight up insane reasons for payment. 1) Most places charge a higher cost on Zomato/Swiggy 2) You are already paying the delivery person under delivery fee 3) The platform charges platform fee for its functioning 4) The packaging is costed separately 5) The tax is counted separately So it does not make any sense for the cost of the item to be higher on a delivery app. Why does Zomato take the platform fee for if they’re already individually charging restaurants a cut on the average money earned through the platform. Come on just because something has been made to ease your way doesn’t mean it can do whatever. That’s almost literally the reason for multiple inventions. All pricing must be fair and explained. That’s just our right as citizens of this country. And food ordering apps thrive not only because of laziness and even if they were surviving on laziness, doesn’t mean someone has to sacrifice something. It’s supposed to be a just economic system, and if you think it makes sense to pay Rs. 500 for a burger that was costed at 350ish makes sense then toh ho gaya. Let’s stop at least giving useless reasons for high charge of things. Also, how do the same items cost different between Swiggy & Zomato (this is without discount)? Shouldn’t costing be regulated? To OP: sorry, other than actually ordering from the restaurant (which might not be feasible in all cases), i’m not sure. maybe an actual cost regulation should be done on how much zomato can charge from restaurants for listing Can you tell about ondc if you use it as a business. What is your opinion about that Initially, it started this way, sales picked up, the companies wanted to reduce their burn per restaurant so the discounts began splitting between the platform and us. Eventually, the difference began increasing (Higher hit for the restaurants) but as the sales were rolling in and some of that cost was indeed absorbed by the aggregator, people didn't pay much heed to it & bam! In no time, restaurants were taking the entire hit & if you aren't running any offers, they would push the restaurants down below and literally force it out of you to see the numbers back. Too much shenanigans. Thanks to Uber Eats for truly disrupting this market and screwing us all !!!! > You will rarely see a local restaurant charge extra for packing charges on Zomato/swiggy, although the international fast food chains always add extra packing charges on top of the increased price. What the hell are you talking about? Many restaurants in Swiggy do charge extra for the packaging, not just international fast food chains. Why the fuck do people feel that they are entitled to free shit? Who do you think is paying for operations of zomato? Packaging? Fuel? Driver salary? If you can't afford ordering in then don't fucking order in. Zomato overcharging is not a scam. It is an extremely common phenomenon in capitalism. The restaurant HAS TO offset the additional costs that zomato slaps on them. Zomato HAS TO do this to stay in business. No, Swiggy & Zomato will always have the same pricing. If there is any parity between the two platforms, both the aggregators will shoot you mails multiple times, if you ignore the same and move on, they'll either block your restaurant until the same is rectified or do it from their back end. Yes! If you do have a genuine reason behind the difference, say it's a trial product or you're revamping your menu then both the platforms will give you sufficient time to correct it across both the applications. Yes, it's 30% and higher now for new restaurants until and unless you own a renowned chain. It’s not shady, these are called cloud kitchens and while some are really not hygienic, as a normal restaurant. Some of them are proper commercial kitchens following really good standards. Read up and research before worrying. Yo I always wanted to moderate a food based Sub. May I? I think the bigger question is why are Indian customers so entitled? This has been discussed to death online. The money for the delivery service must come from somewhere. The customer pays for covenience. If you don't want to pay for the service, please pick it up yourself or start cooking at home. No. You are intimated about price earlier. You enter into contract. Your acceptance can't be conditional. r/FoodEntrepreneursIndia Dude, the best and oldest resturant in my city isn't on Zomato/Swiggy, me and my friends wonder why tf they aren't on those apps. This is the ONLY resturant which we never had any bad experience during Durga Puja. Sometimes I buy from them physically even though they're quite far from my home. Then there are a few extremely good street food vendors and small restaurants who aren't on Zomato/Swiggy too. I don't know why they aren't on Zomato/Swiggy, because their business will definitely do well on those apps given their popularity in the city. I've seen same thing in Kolkata too. Whatever might be the reason, there can be absolutely good restaurants who are not in Zomato/Swiggy. Ah i see. That must be it. I guess they were revamping the menu coz I checked again and now there's no disparity today Dont order from these platforms then .... Go to the restaurant and take away ... They arent doing charity, they are running business... Mat khareedo mere bhai… har baat pe rona zaroori ni hota internet pe. >This would essentially reduce dine-in customers when they can just get it packed and take-away for a little cheaper. Dine-in restaurants best flourish with dine-in customers. > >A dine-in customer, at our outlet, on average spends Rs.150 more than a take-away customer, so we prefer dine-in. I thought, Non dine in sales will be way more scalable than dine in. And you seem like you are just trying to justify, the cost packaging might be comparable to the electricity cost (with AC) alone ( guess) As a former restaurant owner here is the issue we had to deal with. 1. 25% Zomato commision 2. GST 3. Packaging/ Cutlery cost 4. Important!! Extra cost to zomato for getting our restaurant listed on the search results. 5. Extra cost to get our restaurant show up at people's screen. 6. Running Promotional discounts on Zomato. These ad up a lot to our cost and in our line of business If we did not run any of these people would simply not order. Big franchise get orders more easily but still to survive we jave to increase the cost on the online menu. Thanks for reading, and hope you understand the plight of the restaurant owners. Bro the original tunday has an exclusive contract with Swiggy. Don’t know if you know but this isn’t the real deal. Any outlet claiming to be tunday on Zomato is an impersonation. And you can see the real name of the restaurant in the paper bill. You just ordered tunday from New Garam Masala Restaurant. You are ordering on zomato from a restaurant less than 4km from your home go there and get it yourself if you dont want to pay extra, what a dumbass Weird flex but ok Yes, we could stop using it. As simple as that >Then there are the numerous offers we have to keep updating with seasons, events, festivals. The discounts we see on Zomato are borne by the resturant? I thought it was Zomato who gave it. Are you talking about a specific category of discount? like a free dish or the coupon code discount we get like TRYNEW etc. I'm guessing certain type of offers are given by the restaurants. Damn, that's a lot. Thanks for letting me know. As I said, some restaurants choose to inflate the prices only by 10 or 20% instead of 30%, and consider the reduced margins as investment for online exposure. In the hopes that those online customers might one day come for dine-in or atleast spread your name through word of mouth. This guy is full of shit. I hope they don't put same shit in their food I want to raise this issue too. Worked at Zomato in my previous stint. Zomato has a clear cut policy wherein they ask restaurant to provide items on zomato at similar price as to their dine in option. I am not going to defend it but if op wants to take some action reporting to zomato is the best one I'm no fnb entrepreneur but I absolutely can't understand the idea and need of zomato and swiggy. I mean, if you want something, call up the restaurant and give them the damn order. Voh Ghar pe home delivery krdenge. Kyu dena hai inhe extra paisa? Order food that's expensive than normal and then pay delivery charge as well. I may sound uneducated at this but it's just a normal pov, which drives the Indian market. Add in Blinket, instamart as well. Can't understand them and won't ever use them. And this is coming from a gen z. I don’t agree with most comments here which say ‘don’t order from Zomato if you can’t pay for convenience’. The issue here is not Zomato/restaurant overcharging. It is lack of transparency. Zomato/Swiggy should clearly mention how much extra they are charging compared to buying from restaurant directly. The customer should be able to make an informed choice. How much was it for you? Give a number…. expenses were total for 17k. when I cooked at home got food and paid the maid it was 10k I have my fridge full of foods fr9m bacon to ham to cheese and other stuff for my friend that's 36k...he still orders food online. these number are per month No. You are paying for convenience. If you don't like then order from restaurant directly or stop ordering. Restaurant can advertise themselves outside colleges? Newspapers food blogger's?? Rather than these shady apps Nice! WTF 36k?! Zomato ain't a charity. Where else is their money for ads, developers, maintenance, support, management, cloud etc gonna come from? If you are using an aggregator service, you will have to pay for it. Call the restaurant Order your food Book an ola/Uber bike and select drop point as your home Tell your restaurant to pass on your order to the driver ??? PROFIT!!! Walk upto the restaurant simple Then you will realise you have to pay for developers, servers, ads, support, delivery etc. The more popular your app becomes, the more your expenses will be. You will charge restaurants if they want to be on your app. Restaurant owners will increase their prices and offload it to the customer. That sounds familiar 😉 Convenience is costly Yes. Joined. r/IndiaKitchenConfidential also is a good name probably doing swiggy food orders at best discounted price plus free delivery even eligible for non offer providing restaurant and restaurant owners can contact too for swiggy ratings and reviews for food all this for free no single penny charge for orders and for owner minimum amount that includes expenses and bit of profit. feel free to reach dm you won't be paying me for your order you will directly pay swiggy through upi vpa. You can go to the restaurants and order the foods directly.. How are people this ignorant? Zomato charges the restaurant. They have to price it a little higher. A lot of restaurants have now changed their dine in prices to zomato prices so that this divide isn’t there. One of my friends has done that and he gives 20% discount for dine in but menu price is on par with zomato price. Also you’re paying for the luxury of having food delivered to your doorstep, so there are obvious added costs for both the restaurant and the aggregator Yeah. Go walk and buy your food. Delivery apps charge an additional markup every bill to sellers. That money got to come out of somewhere. I only order directly from the restaurant. Zomato takes its cut, so evidently charges more. They want you to believe that they’re ‘just’ adding ₹ 3 to the cost of your order for the convenience of delivery. They could easily delete that entry altogether but then even a layperson starts wondering how their business model works. It’s subtle bullshittery at its finest. The very best restaurants would never even consider dealing with trash like Zomato and Swiggy. Come-in and eat, like you’re meant to. Yes. Don’t buy Yeah, faasos, behrouz and ovenstory are cloud kitchens as well Don't buy from Zomato/Swiggy. Simple. This is actually a superb idea! We want to start a cloud kitchen service as well and all ideas/opinions + discussions on finance/management and issues businesses face will be super helpful! Would be lovely if someone could also create a step by step guide for instance! So thank you for such a good start! Zomato/swiggy takes 25-28% cut from the restaurant bro That's seperate thing like business thing but here i just showed you a problem and someone has to decide what can be done to develop an app, 😜 Parrot whoa, this is nice! You can't. That's it. Zomato ,Swiggy etc are for-profit organisations They are not doing community service >those who aren't on it might just not be up to the mark, atleast in my opinion. That's nuts! 💀 # Order food online directly to the restaurant. Google map would be your starting point to know the restaurant details like address, distance from your location, contact no., menu etc. Most mid-sized restaurants would have at least one of the below 1. A mobile app, like or 2. A website like or 3. A Whatsapp number to take down orders. Mention that it is a \"Pickup\" order Payment method: \"Cash on Delivery\" Laze around at home and saunter 15 minutes later to the restaurant, pick up your order and pay COD. Enjoy your meal at home. This is a win-win for both your local restaurants (the aggregator is bypassed) and for you, the consumer (lower bill and a wee bit of exercise). Isn't the cost of delivery cheaper than the cost of an in house diner? I would call extra money as time tax. Tax you pay to save the time. Most of the restaurants do all the above. It's just that in the long term scenario to generate sales, you have to opt for these applications cause in certain restaurants it brings in 75% of the sales. they are charging about 35% in their newer contracts If your restaurant is nearby a crowdy private engineering or art science college ultimately you have better chance of earning then i think location of restaurant matters Actually if a restaurant is on roadside of highway it will also have better chances of benefit In crowded market it is supposed to compete with others too and maintain better image too Are you going to handle cost since Zomato swiggy are highly greedy regarding this commission system?? If you increase prize customer will ultimately prefer more and more street food or extremely smaller shops My friend recently opened one in Visakhapatnam. He has troubles finding it as mostly they are selling it on over the price than it should be. Really think a community full of you guys would be very helpful. Yes go to the restaurant and order. Go and buy from the restaurant directly? A step by step guide will depend on various factors. It will be easier to find a local consultant who will be able to help you in a better way. We'll be happy to help you with the basics at r/FoodEntrepreneurIndia. Please create a post and I'll take care of the approval. Actually no, Zomato says upfront that prices are set by restaurants and restaurants can charge whatever they like, it's upto the customer whether to buy or not. Yes. Don't order from delivery apps. Simple. They are providing a service and if it isn't enough for you that they are delivering the cooked food to your door with step by step location of your food then you can go get it yourself from the restaurant. They are not running a charity. I have had stores near colleges and honestly, it doesn't always work. Yes, initially, you might rake in some good numbers but once the hype dies down, your sales take a major beating. Furthermore, it highly depends on the product & how it's priced. You may have to introduce the student menu / discounts to woo this demography. Overall, in my experience over the years, it's a hit or miss. The customer doesn't mind paying that \"Extra\" bucks if you're selling quality products. Now, I have done the following and it's helping me do better each day. • Strict Quality control & SOPs. i.e hire 4 cleaners instead of 2. • Improved Packaging even though I have to take a hit on the same but I make sure that the packaging is premium and well designed. • Improve the quality of base spices used. • Keep working on your procurement, the more aggressive you are the better it works. • Keep innovating. Nearby my college most businesses are running fine even a small vendors too they benefit from a 10000 students population who will surely buy anything may be a Biryani or ice cream or coffee or pizza or Paratha almost anything I remember i eat parathas with my friends 2 yrs ago iin a restaurant just nearby the quality was extremely poor and it was overpriced still the restaurant is running extremely well now infact now bigger now I agree with you on that last lines Restaurant owner here and I completely agree. Most customers complain about the price difference unaware of the charges these apps deduct. Online food delivery services charge an exorbitant amount as their cut. It's somewhere from 20% to 30% Food items generally sell at 100% margin on the raw ingredients. Like if the food ingredients cost 50rs, then general food retailers will sell the item for 100rs. (if you go up the restaurant ladder, bigger restaurants will take more margin) but now if you sell the same item on zomato, zomato will need about 30% as their own commission. So now you are getting only 20 rs in margin instead of 50. That is not enough for a small food vendor to sustain. So the rates are generally high on zomato. I believe chain restaurants have their cut adjusted on zomato. So they can generally charge same and have enough in profit. Dude, getting onboard zomato is a piece of cake. There isn't any standard. You have to have a food license. That's all. It costed me 800rs to get a food vendor licence for my wife's home baking business. We got on zomato easily but after seeing that we need to hike the rates by almost 30% on all the food to get a good margin just turned us off. The profile is still active with 0 items on the menu. It's true, but charging about 30% is very harsh. They also charge a delivery fee. Awesome. Really appreciate it man. Really happy to be a part of it. Hoping we can make a strong community out of this. Even abroad they don't charge 30% lol..that's way too much. Uber Eats abroad charges 25% and that's the highest of all delivery services Do keep in mind that there's no tipping culture here and it's heavily implied there, almomst 20% of their order...so unless youre ready to shell out another 20%, just sit in your couch and pay the fees lmao"
