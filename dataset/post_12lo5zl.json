It's a duet.\n3. In the song, the woman is trying to convince the man that they can make their relationship work but he feels like it's doomed to fail because of their differences.\nShe compares herself to a cloud (pretty sure 'badli' word was used) and him to a river and that their destinies are intertwined and that it's her fate to eventually meet him, like when clouds rain & end up in the river.\n\nPlease help me!! I loved this song and cannot remember it at all. It's like a brain itch that doesn't go away.\n\nEdit: [Found it](https://youtu.be/ClAXd0itpsA) ðŸ˜¬",

        "I just found the song. Not even a minute ago. The feeling is orgasmic ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­\n\nI had been trying to Google it for the past 2 hours. Only to find out I had everything wrong about it. The actors, the male singer, the lyricist. All I had right was the year lol.\nI just went through 200 songs by Mukesh before giving up and going back to search on YouTube. All I did was play 2 3 similar songs so the algorithm does the magic. I did have to scroll a lot but eventually found it. \n\nThe song is Itna Na Mujh Se Tu from Chhaya (1961).\nPicturised on Sunil Dutt and Asha Parekh, sung by Lata and Talat Mahmood. Never in my life I would have thought to search for Talat Mahmood songs.\nEven the lyricist name I haven't heard before.",
