Bjp itself doesnt find anything wrong in it.\n\nMost people dont know but the judge who gave life sentence to maya kodnani , suffered a lot. Her name was jytosana yagnik.

I am not supporter of any party, but this is clear misuses of institutions. According to defamation laws, only person who has been defamed can file it. So , lalit modi, nirav modi and narendra modi can only file it. And our PM has said even worse things in past.
