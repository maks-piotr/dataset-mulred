Ajmal‚Äôs people,‚Äù Sarma said at a public meeting in Lakhimpur, reported [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ajmal-people-medical-engineering-seats-assam-doesnt-prioritise-education-himanta-8682752/).\n\n‚ÄúWe have no objection to them studying and taking the seats. Take 20-30%. But if they take all, it will hurt us, won‚Äôt it?‚Äù he said.\n\nSince taking over as chief minister of Assam in 2021, Sarma has made several Islamophobic comments.\n\nOn the same day, Sarma used the term ‚ÄúHussain Obamas‚Äù in a tweet in response to a journalist who asked if a first information report has been filed in Guwahati against former United States President Barack Obama after he said that India risks ‚Äúpulling apart‚Äù if the government does not protect the rights of Muslims.",
