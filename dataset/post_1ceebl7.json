    "selftext": "In Karnataka, from last few days there's a huge sex scandal (I don't know what else to call it) came to light accusing the Prajval Revanna, (Current MP from Hassan and grandson of former prime minister HD Devegowda and nephew of former Karnataka Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy.) of raping several women. I thought it was some election propaganda from opposition parties, so did not bother much. \n\nBut today two women (house hold workers) came to live TV Channel and accused both Prajval Revanna & his father HD Revanna of sexual harassment, these women are former workers at Prajval Revanna's house in Holenarasi pura, (his hometown in Hassan District). This is huge in the eyes of law, because two women came out and accusing openly of sexual harassment, now I believe it is more than election propaganda. I saw few videos where couple of MLA's expressed concern and Women welfare association president said, she has complained to the commissioner and demanded for investigation. \n\nAlso, yesterday DCM of Karnataka mentioned this incident briefly in an interview. Other than that everybody is silent, I don't know why, no major TV channels are covering it, nobody, who is powerful enough ever mentioned this incident at all, surprisingly nobody from HD Devegowda family nor anyone from BJP said anything about this (at least they should have denied about these incident ever happened), I am baffled at this point, I am truly questioning the society I am living in. I know Devegowda is from powerful caste, but most of the women who were being harassed are from their own caste. Also, he recorded several selfie/normal videos with female bureaucrats making them strip clothes.\n\nMy question is, at this point it's not politics anymore, everybody in the Karnataka know about this incident (at least powerful people), but they are all silent including media, why? is it fear? Being a Kannadiga myself, I did not know Kannadigas are this cowards. \n\n\n[Source (In Kannada)](https://www.youtube.com/live/2b6VNwmbkxU?si=nNE1dTiRJdXTRChk)\n\nTLDR - Prajval Revanna, the current MP and Grandson of former PM Devegowda has been accused of rapes & sexual harassment, but media is silent why?",

        "So much of nari shakti.",
        "searched after reading this https://www.youtube.com/live/9-Wkfxv09J8\nnot all no other tv medias are covering",
        "Why is the state government not making a scene out of it and doing the investigation thoroughly to bring him to justice? \n\nBJP would have set an example out of an opposition MP who was accused of such crimes, even if falsely, especially in an election year.",
        "Can someone tell me why an \"Accused\" person must ensure that harassment that comes along with media coverage. The accusation might be true it might be false but untill and unless the crime is proven in the courts the media should not disclose the name of the 'accused' because in our country innocent men's entire future gets destroyed.",
        "I think the reason why not a lot of news channels are openly questioning is due to his family. And until and unless they've all the proof they need, they don't want to go against that family and attract hate from the public. \n\nThe timing of the allegation is obviously making his followers question the validity of the allegations. And I'm not sure if the videos are edited are not, (I've read people saying it's edited and also that it's not), but many people seem to believe those are deep fake videos and it's not actually him. That maybe another reason why you don't see a lot of backlash online.\n\nBut he needs to be punished (and needs to be stripped off his MP title in case he wins, which he most probably will) if this turns out to be true.",
        "I know, but I think it is most likely true. No TV channel would have covered it if all the videos were deep faked. There are more than 2000 video clips and people who have it certainly know they are not faked videos. DCM mentioned it, Power TV channel anchor said videos are 100% real and he has them all.Â ",

        "This is 100% real, he fled the country, all ministers spoke about it and CM of Karnataka order a special investigation. But BJP & JDS completely silent about this.",

He has a rape case against him he should stay in india and fight the case then people will respect him instead of leaving the country ðŸ˜‚ of-course then people will look him guilty also he is from bjp coalition hence the media is not covering it extensively or else now andhbhakts will start defending someone who has been accused of rape lol",
        "I wrote this comment before the news of him leaving India came up. Also Indian laws regarding male rake accused are very biased and are essentially guilty until proven innocent so my point is still right.",
