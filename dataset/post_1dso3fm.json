    "url": "https://www.change.org/Make_Indias_RapeLaws_GenderNeutral_In_BharatiyaNyayaSanhita",
    "selftext": "\nStarting from today, ie. from 1st of July 2024,  sexual assault of a man will no longer be a \"crime\" in India under the new Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita laws. And the already marginalised community of transgender persons will continue to face discrimination in receiving protection from being raped. Transgender victims are not taken as seriously as women rape victims and even the punishment for rape of both has huge difference which shows the disparity. \n\n\nResearch shows that men who are sexually abused are more likely to develop suicidal thoughts just like women survivors. Including just women victims in the ambit of rape victims is discriminatory. It is violation of Fundamental rights of men and transgender persons under Article 14, 15 and 21 which guarantees equal treatment before law and non-discrimination.\n\nHence, I created a petition on 23rd June, 2024  to make our rape laws gender-neutral in the BNS. (After me, some others have also created similar petitions on same website). \n\nKindly check out & go through my petition to understand WHY this cause is important.\n\n Each signature matters as it represents your voice. Please sign, share and support my petition .‚úäÔ∏èüôè\n\n\n\n",

        "It was pointed to the Centre at the time of passing of BNS itself that the new laws leave men vulnerable by not only not including them but also removing the only law that punishes rape of men by men. The Centre went ahead and passed it anyway. This is just PR now.",
        "Yeah they are doing it because of the backlash, but I just wanted to tell op that maybe this will happen as I thought it‚Äôs relevant to his cause.",
        "Yes, they are giving statements because of the backlash. That doesn't mean an actual amendment.",
        "Okay let‚Äôs hope for the best :)",

        "Love how when the Bill was being passed, everyone was busy blaming opposition for getting kicked out of Parliament and now that the Bill is Act and going in effect, people are remembering what is written in it...",
        "Entire left liberal side is going to oppose what you're doing. I'm surprised there aren't any comments calling people \"incels\" for even thinking about this.",
        "Yes..thanks for bringing it up. I saw the Hindu post too. However, this is not the first time we are debating the need for gender neutral rape law. There have been numerous writ petitions in courts and even private member bills in Parliament yet no governmnent had the guts to make rape laws gender-neutral . They did not even keep the recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Commitee which was reviewing the BNS bill.\n\nBringing back Section 377 is not the same as making rape law \"gender-neutral\".  This is an important thing to note. The gravity of \"rape\" is same regardless of your gender.  If they bring another similar section to 377 it does not solve the issue.",

        "I am a woman too and a survivor.I believe anyone fighting for basic equality (which is huge part of leftist ideology) should have the conscience to oppose this. Protection of law is a basic right of all people.",

        "We cannot guarantee change. But previously lawmakers have put up new laws after petitions. So being positive and raising voice is the only thing we can do. I have read a recent Hindu article that law makers are now contemplating a new law for men after the backlash.  Maybe it wont happen very quickly. Maybe after 5-10 years the change happens. Still it is worth it for our future generation. \n\nIn times like these, I  want to remember Ravish Kumar's quote - \n\n\"Not All Battles are Fought For Victory. Some are Fought to Tell The World That Somebody was There On the Battlefield.\"",
        "I just feel it is a very big over-sight. How can experts in law unsee such a big loophole is kind of puzzling for me. But yes I get that it might be a drama to bring back the whole 377 section including the criminalisation of consentual sex part which was rightly removed by SC.",

        "After the removal of 377, there is no law for sexual assault of men, only assault. Assault carries a maximum penalty of two years. In the Trans Act, assault including sexual assault have a maximum penalty of two years. Coincidence? I think not. The government has taken a stance that two years should be maximum for rape if you are not a woman. Simple.",
        "Yeah...that is what I pointed out in my petition. That this is discriminatory towards men and transgender persons. All rapes are equally grave.",
        "I don't disagree with you. Quote the opposite. I agree that it is discriminatory. But the discrimination is intentional. They said this as much during the discussion of the Trans Bill itself that 'enraging the modesty of a woman is not the same as engaging the modesty of an eunuch'. The amendment raised by DMK MP Tiruchi Siva to make it equal to rape law was VOTED DOWN by the NDA. It is not an oversight. It is intentional. And while I respect the attempt at a petition and have signed it, petitions can only fix oversights, not intention to do harm by a government.",
        "I understand your valid point and frustration. We all know certain ongoing things are very intentional and unfair.",
        "Is it ? DMing the petition link.",
        "I understand and know your concern is valid. This is sadly seen all over the world. We should stand with all victims. I hope some day women like us can bring change.",
        "I'm not sure if you've lived in India for the past decade. \n\nBut signing petitions will do fuck all. \n\nPeople protest outside for months and no one gives a shit so you really think your online petition will make any difference at all? \n\nThe current regime is too arrogant, they won't give a shit about you unless you start hurting them electorally.",

        "Absolutely right.",
        "Well I have been living in India since birth. A millenial. Anyway, the road safety laws were made based on petitions. But I know that they are not as powerful as UK petitions. It is also bringing awareness....the more people know the more pressure. There is a post in Hindu that govt is now being pressured to create a law for men after backlash",
        "Well from what I've read, they're creating separate laws for men which will be drafted soon. \n\nHence, the reason for excluding from the given section. \n\nIt has been ongoing from before the backlash, it's just that this government sucks at communicating and discussing their bills at parliament so people know nothing about most of it until it's passed.",
        "See if they wanted they could have included when they launched this entire new law code. They have added many new sections like  anti-trafficking , false promise to marry as seperate sexual offence with imprisionment called Section 69 etc. So, they already launched whatever new laws they wanted. Thing is they never expected the backlash that they are getting similar to how they thought of 400+. Pure delusion!  So now they are under pressure to create a new law because people are not as dumb like before.",
        "Yeah that's the thing. \n\nIf the bill was discussed in the parliament and scrutinised, all these issues with the bill would have been discussed, listed down and improved upon before it was passed.\n\nThat's the basic process, the BJP is so arrogant they never follow this process. \n\nThey just want to bulldoze everything to show that they're still in charge. \n\nEven the farm Bill could have easily worked if it was just passed after following a basic parliamentary process but it didn't because they tried to shove it down our throat.",
        "These are sad times unfortunately. Kind if helpless situation for us citizens.",
        "Yeah. \n\nBut I do see the change. Most people have stopped buying their nonsense and finally seeing them for what they are. \n\nAnd with the NEET Scam, NET Scam, infrastructure failing all over the country, the smoke screen of development and good governance has faded and people are finally seeing their true colors.\n\nIt's a slow process and it's just the beginning.

Will the victim be able to press charges?\n\n2) A adult women rapes an underage. Will posco interfere or it will be the class underage male fault ?\n\n3) An adult male rapes a underage male.",
        "1) A man rapes another man is no longer a crime under the new BNS which started operating yesterday.\n\n2) An adult woman rapes underage then POCSO will apply. POCSO is gender-neutral law.\n\n3) An adult male rapes an underage male , POCSO applies here too.\n\nI have covered these issues in my petition so if you read it you will know.",
