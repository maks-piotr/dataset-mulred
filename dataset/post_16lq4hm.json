Surely, you people don't have any problem with them I think...\n\n2) This was a scheme that was active during the previous BJP government as well.

        "u/NoooNameMan, your comments aren't visible here.\n\nAnyway, to answer your question, there's a very practical reason for such segmentation. \n\nThink of any crowded place in India - around an eatery's cashier, around nationalized bank counters, bus pass counters, college admission counters. \n\nHas any of them felt equitable to you? Like when a child or old person or disabled approaches, do people make way for them? Or give up their place for them?\n\nOf course not. Might is right. \n\nIf you herd all segments to a single counter, only the mightiest - the people with the right religion, right caste, and right connections - will corner most of the benefits. We already know how they work from Sachar committee as well as SC / ST reports.\n\nIn a population of 80% Hindus to 20% non-Hindus with known inequities along religious and caste axes, if you set up only one common scheme for all, can you guess who'll corner most of the subsidy? \n\nThat's why they segment it through multiple departments. It's just setting up multiple dedicated counters for more equitable distribution. \n\nYour concern for \"the poor\" is touching but you don't have to worry. Even after segmentation, the overall breakup will still be overwhelmingly Hindu, like 70-80% Hindu upper caste. That's what reservation data from educational institutions have shown, for example. Such segmentation is only on paper and a bare minimum necessity to prevent every scheme from becoming 90-95% Hindu upper caste!",
        "Now, according to Islam, sikhism and Catholic religions, there is no caste system. So by that logic all SC are hindus. But wait, SC has reservation in most places. \nSecond, if they are reserving schemes for even Hindu SC/ST, I would say its wrong. It should be for economically backward classes only. See, being 'not a modi supporter' isn't that hard. Nor is the need to bring vote bank politics everywhere. If you are in support for this subsidy, you should be in support of the PM schemes as well. That way you shouldn't be posting anything against it. Is you aren't in support of PM's scheme because it favours a religion, you should be against this scheme as well since it supports a particular religion. In your run to hate anything Modi, you have just gotten worse than him.",

        "There is a fake news case filed against the journalist from India Today group who decided to present this in the manner he presented. The Govt scheme applies to minorities, OBC and SC/ST. For SC/ST the subsidy is something like 75%. And very important - this is available only if your income is less than 4.5 lakh and if the vehicle is bought as a means of generating self-employment. Based on the impacted group - the subsidy is routed through the respective Govt organisation. The ad was by the Karnataka Minorities development Corporation - So obviously non-minorities cannot apply here - but need to apply through their own applicable corporation. \n\nSo lets not discriminate against the poor - whatever their religion.",
        "Thats a relief",
        "Ok, my answer was actually based on the social analysis rather than political. For subsidy for a religious minority to not \"make sense,\" social and economic conditions of all religious must be perfectly equitable. Since we know they aren't, I was curious what OP's reasoning is.\n\nFrom political pov, despite conspicuous and continuous Hindu appeasement over decades, if privileged Hindu votebank insists on playing false victim, best to give up on them and just focus on poor Hindu and non-Hindu votebanks (which they have done through such schemes).\n\nAlso, I'd say these Karnataka congress people aren't that dumb.

This, however, is not really true for any state. Any donations given to a temple — whether from collections in the hundi, or given privately — go into its bank account. The temples’ budget needs the HR&CE Department’s approval to utilise some funds, however, these funds can only be used for activities related to the temples, and cannot – by law – be pocketed by the officials appointed by the government to the temple trusts and boards.<\nSo going by this, how can temple donations be withdrawn by the government for other purposes when it is mandatory to be used for purposes which benefit the temple itself?\n\nLater on it is mentioned that historically the reason government control even exists in temples in the south atleast is because in the past, the private authorities would bar lower caste communities from worshipping or taking up trustee positions in the temple. So lower caste communities complained and government stepped in. If private trusts want back control then they will have to be different from the past.",

Anyway, to answer your question, there's a very practical reason for such segmentation. Think of any crowded place in India - around an eatery's cashier, around nationalized bank counters, bus pass counters, college admission counters. Has any of them felt equitable to you? Like when a child or old person or disabled approaches, do people make way for them? Or give up their place for them? Of course not. Might is right. If you herd all segments to a single counter, only the mightiest - the people with the right religion, right caste, and right connections - will corner most of the benefits. We already know how they work from Sachar committee as well as SC / ST reports. In a population of 80% Hindus to 20% non-Hindus with known inequities along religious and caste axes, if you set up only one common scheme for all, can you guess who'll corner most of the subsidy? That's why they segment it through multiple departments. It's just setting up multiple dedicated counters for more equitable distribution. Your concern for \"the poor\" is touching but you don't have to worry. Even after segmentation, the overall breakup will still be overwhelmingly Hindu, like 70-80% Hindu upper caste. That's what reservation data from educational institutions have shown, for example. Such segmentation is only on paper and a bare minimum necessity to prevent every scheme from becoming 90-95% Hindu upper caste! Now, according to Islam, sikhism and Catholic religions, there is no caste system. So by that logic all SC are hindus. But wait, SC has reservation in most places. Second, if they are reserving schemes for even Hindu SC/ST, I would say its wrong. It should be for economically backward classes only. See, being 'not a modi supporter' isn't that hard. Nor is the need to bring vote bank politics everywhere. If you are in support for this subsidy, you should be in support of the PM schemes as well. That way you shouldn't be posting anything against it. Is you aren't in support of PM's scheme because it favours a religion, you should be against this scheme as well since it supports a particular religion. In your run to hate anything Modi, you have just gotten worse than him. The reply counter's the OP's false allegation that poor Hindus are being neglected. I honestly didn't get the rest of your logic at all. Anyway, I'm in favour of all these schemes. It's about social justice. I've also explained below (or, if it's not visible, in my profile) why segmentation is essential for genuine equity with such schemes The only PM scheme I was referring to here was the PM skill development scheme. OP, tihaadi has been booked for propagating the same. The scheme is there for minorities and sc/st and has been in place for years imams salary and various grants to mosque for repair is also appeasement ,waqf board, hajj subsidy ( cancelled only in 2022) 18000 rs to imams a fresher salary for following their religion Regarding hindu appeasement you mentioned above , all the big temples comes under control of government controlled trust all the donation money received by temples are going to the government Mosque don't comes under state controlled trust . We the tax payers are funding all the muslims mosque . Hindus are funding their own subsidy basically since all the donation money is going to the government > Imam salary, waqf board, et Same [grants](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/priests-to-get-6th-pay-commission-wages/article36974625.ece) are given for priests, temple repair, temple trusts, pilgrimage. > We the tax payers are funding all the muslims mosque . Tax payers are also funding Hindu temples. Muslims are also tax payers. Christians are also tax payers. Muslim and Christian taxes are also funding Hindu temples and pilgrimages. Hindu appeasement isn't new at all. It's just that you prefer to be deliberately blind to it and see only Muslim grants because it helps you enjoy playing victimvictim based on lies and disinformation. >Hindu appeasement isn't new at all. Hindu temples come under government controlled trust all the donation goes directly to the government It's just that you are blind to it . half of all the temples comes under control of government. >temple trusts, All the donation money is given to government Temple priest only gets 2000 and imams gets 18000 a salary of freshers >It's just that you prefer to be deliberately blind to it and see only hindu because it helps you enjoy playing victimvictim based on lies and disinformation. It not newly introduced, this is being continued from the previous government. This is the piece for which FIR has been filed against Sudhir Chaudhry Because it will come back to bite their ass in next election. It is like they are never learning When you use such a simplistic divide to judge the real lives of people they just end up turning into statics which belittle the pain of the poor. Now imagine two people in a low class neighbourhood. They live side by side enduring the same harsh situations of life that comes with being poor. They have barely managed to build some savings for their lives to get better in the future. They only difference is one is a \"Hindu\" and another one is not. Now just because everyone has imagined that minorities need uplifting...he has to watch his neighbour get help by the government from loans to subsidies while he barely scraps by for ends meet because the government wouldn't help him as he is of a \"Majority relgion\". Makes no sense > Watch his neighbour get help by the government from loans to subsidies Do you really think most poor non-Hindus get such loans and subsidies? That too in a Hindu-dominated civil society and banking sector that practices both silent and conspicuous discrimination based on religion as well as class. The scheme clearly lays out the criteria which are mostly economic. But you're writing as if all non-Hindus get such loans. > ... while he barely scraps by for ends meet because the government wouldn't help him as he is of a \"Majority relgion\". Despite my providing evidence of such welfare schemes for Hindus? \"Makes no sense\" only because you're assuming an exaggerated false narrative and ignoring all evidence. There is a fake news case filed against the journalist from India Today group who decided to present this in the manner he presented. The Govt scheme applies to minorities, OBC and SC/ST. For SC/ST the subsidy is something like 75%. And very important - this is available only if your income is less than 4.5 lakh and if the vehicle is bought as a means of generating self-employment. Based on the impacted group - the subsidy is routed through the respective Govt organisation. The ad was by the Karnataka Minorities development Corporation - So obviously non-minorities cannot apply here - but need to apply through their own applicable corporation. So lets not discriminate against the poor - whatever their religion. Thats a relief Ok, my answer was actually based on the social analysis rather than political. For subsidy for a religious minority to not \"make sense,\" social and economic conditions of all religious must be perfectly equitable. Since we know they aren't, I was curious what OP's reasoning is. From political pov, despite conspicuous and continuous Hindu appeasement over decades, if privileged Hindu votebank insists on playing false victim, best to give up on them and just focus on poor Hindu and non-Hindu votebanks (which they have done through such schemes). Also, I'd say these Karnataka congress people aren't that dumb. Many things they did or said sounded like mistakes to the average Hindu redditor (incl me) but at the end of the day they did win a majority of the seats in the election. Clearly, they understand subaltern Karnataka population better than the average Hindu redditors do. These 2 are different schemes in the same state one is for sc/st and another is for religious minorities (Jain muslim , Christian budhist basicly anyone non Hindu ) The anchor was booked bcz he said it was started by Congress which was false “Not a Modi supporter” aka “don’t know how to Google” Government subsidising vehicle purchase is one of the dumbest policy ever The Sachar Committee Report which studied economic backwardness in India is laughing at your rage-bait, OP. If you read the scheme, you'd know the scheme has a condition of economic backwardness but then again why let a simple fact like that ruin your narrative? According to them general category can't be poor Right. If you read my comment I said the only basis for subsidy should be the economic factor. But sure why let that ruin your narrative. Ideologically against all freebies anywhere to anyone. I read your comment. All it shows me is that you refuse to believe what the data has proven: social backwardness with economic backwardness leads to worse outcomes than just economic backwardness. Not really my fault you were sleeping in political science classes or you think you somehow know better than the multiple committees that did countrywide surveys. Your take is no worse than any Karen who decides that the vaccines are dangerous because she thinks they are. Facts and figures back the policy. I see. So you must be against government building roads. Roads are just freebies for those with purchasing power to move quickly. Why not to everyone? Poor is poor regardless of religion, caste, gender. Fuck bpl people I guess right Can they stop giving free things from our money thankyou Loaded question. I refuse to engage if you are not coming from a place of conversation. Congress is worse than bjp He basically implied the state had brought a scheme which was targeted at minorities and discriminated against Hindus. 75k vs 3 lakh is a massive difference still Can you elaborate? Respectfully, no. Sudhir Chaudhary TV chod ke ab tu reddit pe bhi adhe adhuri fake news failane chale aya. Lol It's implemented by department of Minorities, this is their job. More cars are the solution. Yes thank you automobile lobby. Is there is any legal way where a majority guy become minority? 👀👀 Asking for a friend Doesn't the government renovate and even use funds to build new temples like the Ayodhya one? So the 65% goes towards temples upkeep and building new ones. Here is one for Karnataka If the most costliest expense of temple construction is borne by the government then they will have a say in who gets the collection from it no? Why so, many right wingers keep humiliting muslims as puncturewalas, backward, criminals, terrorists, backwords..what is the solution. Yes they can't come up on there own, so what if govt helps then to give some respect. Yes if some hindus(dalits) as backward, sewarage workers but they aren't as humiliated as muslims. so shouldn't they be left alone if not humiliated as puncturewala(puncherwala) if govt or others can't help them or can't see anyone else helping them come up in life. older temple which are under control of government trust are older than Indian government btw they didn't build any of them they take all our donation money and sometime repair with our donation money and use these in implementing welfare scheme . Ayodhya temple is being made with the by donation money they collected 5000 crore rs Apart from lands given to RSS for shakhas. BJP govt also gave and continued a lot of such schemes, maybe just in paper. No muslim is talked to without reference to puncturewala, terrorist, criminal, pakistan, kashmir. either decide muslims are well to do and leave them alone or help them or let anyone else to help them. But then no one else as backward or even worse is called out with slangs than muslims In short government is not doing any favour in doing repair and maintenance of temples they take far more money from our temples 24000 crores from just 6 of them According to them general category hindu can't be poor That's an invalid argument. Roads are not freebies. We pay for it during vehicle registration. It literally called Road tax. We pay for it again when we pay toll tax and then again under infrastructure development when we pay income tax. Moreover roads allows for travels of goods, which results in Goods and Service Tax.. So technically the Govt gets paid for building roads in multiple ways. Not to mention that travel of goods using the road network leads is part of supply chain management which rotates the wheels of economy. Alright. Show me the data that validates only Muslim based low economic classes had to be provided this scheme. Sure there are other minority backward classes. Even Jains are minority. I mean I didn't have political science classes to sleep in, you apparently did so I am all ears. I will also like to know how favouring one community over the other will not create a disbalance in the society. Because social stability will be needed as well. You are the star pupil, go ahead. @Pleasantlyrough I'm being prevented from replying to the comment. Anyway, all those arguments that can be made, using direct taxes and indirect taxes, to justify a vehicle subsidy scheme. Or really any welfare subsidy. You thought you did something by the sarcasm, didn't you? Go read the Sachar Committee report. It has the numbers you need to see. But I have a feeling numbers won't be enough for you. Actually I will read. I hope you have answer for my other questions. No, not in terms of social fabric, a poor upper class Hindu faces much less wrath than a lower class Hindu or a Muslim , so on and so forth Free education, electricity, water and food? This is why I do not want Congress in centre subsidy at some thing as small amount of level is ok for reasonable things like purchasing ev car , solar panel many more, but this is like going bankruptcy. Congress is winning many election with their freebies advertisement. Which is not good for state and country. I don't even need to read that report apparently. Because the whole report is just about status of Muslim. It doesn't even consider other minority. I don't see the govt launching schemes for Christians, sikhs, jains or other minorities. It is what it is, political appeasement. And I don't need to be a political scientist to see that. Acting on social and economic backwardness is a Constitutional principle. If someone thinks the Constitution is wrong because it aims to correct social inequalities and doing so affects 'social stability' then my response can only be laughter at the absurd claim. So, for your response, just imagine booming circus laughter at the joke posed as a question. Yup, want to live in the Stone Age. Better public infrastructure - No since no votes More vehicles on the same shitty roads and more burden to the budget - Hell yeah because votes! Yup, they can't be because… oh wait they can be my parents were literally homeless when I was like 2 years old. When did I ever state that economic or social upliftment shouldn't be worked upon? The only criteria for this scheme was to be a muslim and earn less than 4.5 lacs a year. So other minorities shouldn't be even considered? If the scheme was meant for say all minorities, would it be wrong? But wait, what will happen to the vote bank. Muslim constitutes about 20% of population. So, other religious minorities are minority in even Minority category. But obviously they don't deserve it. And if socially backward muslims are economically weaker, they would also qualify for the scheme since it would either have all economic backward classes or all minority based economic backward classes. There was absolutely no reason to make it religion specific. A) So on this post that applies to Christians, and other religious minorities, you are pissed because it doesn't include the religious majority. B) On a Committee that gave data on backwardness of Muslims, you are concerned about Christians. So basically, a scheme including Christians is bad because it doesn't include Hindus, a committee studying Muslims is bad because it doesn't include Christians. Because ultimately for you any government scheme which includes Muslims will be 'appeasement' because appeasement is part of your dog-whistle politics. 'Coexistence as appeasement' part of Vajpayee politics can't be countered by numbers for the simple reason that it is not based on numbers. So, like I said before, I had a feeling numbers won't be enough. You forgot toll. Some of the highways in India have massive toll tax. Roads being “freebies” is the dumbest thing i have heard today It is social AND economic backwardness, not social OR economic backwardness. Also, the scheme you are complaining about is based on religious minorities, not just Muslims. Since you are so concerned that Christians, Jains, Parsis weren't part of the Sachar Committee, you should probably feel happy that they are getting benefits under this scheme for employment generation, no? But no, your heartburn is based on Muslims getting anything at all. Exactly 300000 * 10lac people 3000 CR they can easily lay 100km off metro track A) you just assumed anything you wanted. B) i never saw the article mention that the reason for the subsidy was because of that particular report. And if that was, what about all the other report? C) when did I oppose Christians or any other minority. I mean in a minute you raised upper class hindus issue. Here I was talking about other minorities which you actually never agreed upon. And my my the language. Weren't you the political science student. Didn't you learn to be politically correct. Apparently you were sleeping in that class too. The problem is everyone hates the centre because they play the religious card, but when anyone else plays it, it becomes totally okay. How blatantly these guys(India today) mislead. Scheme was started in bjp times and is for minorities(50%. Subsidy), obc,sc,st 75% subsidy. Lol. Just because you think mentioning caste is politically incorrect, doesn't mean it is. \"Everyone hates the Centre when they play the religious card\". Delhi 2020 and its bloodshed looks bad at this illogical statement. But I get it. Because the BJP is so obviously communal, you need to pretend other parties are also communal otherwise how will you pretend your communal thoughts aren't communal. Facts, actions, and remission of people convicted of rape based on religion, introduction of Bill so mercy pleas decided by the President doesn't go to Supreme Court...all show very well where the communal actions are. No more congress...it's I.N.D.I Alliance Okay I.N.D.I Alliance is worse than BJP Okay I.N.D.I Alliance is worse than BJP Do you remember sikh riots? Or do you think there no riots in India before 2014 or before even gujrat? Actually how much further back in history do you need to go? Actually did Rajiv Gandhi the PM from the foremost secular party of India with a majority govt help Shah bano. Thats the thing really. People have short term memory. I actually remember anti-Sikh riots pretty well. It was state sponsored violence. Is your argument that state sponsored violence happened in 1984 so State sponsored violence is acceptable in 2020, too? Cute. My memory is fine. I am just aware that if I kill my neighbor tomorrow, someone killed someone else in another street won't be an excuse for it. CAG reports mention 21,000 crores under-reported and diverted out of government accounts, but sure, a scheme based on employment generation is the problem. \"Helping non-Hindus will help the BJP\" has been an argument used for a very very long time and the vote has moved to the BJP regardless along religious lines. So it makes sense to give up that fear and govern right I mean you cherry picked a act of violence. So I can't do the same? Actually search for biggest riots in India. See how many were under secular governments. Again, I never said violence was acceptable. You were the one who moved to that topic. And if you inferred that from my response, maybe you need to up your conversational skill. I mean you obviously termed me as upper hindu class supporter who listens to a dog whistle, but you were supposed to be the better one, right? What money does the church receive from the government? Every church has been built sans any Indian government involvement. Our own local church was built with contributions from parishioners. The only church restoration work undertaken by the Indian government are those UNESCO heritage sites in Goa. ?? This proves that temples collectvway less in donations than the Union governments collections? How much does it cost to maintain dilapidated structures? Or build newer ones? Funds have been spent on the Ayodhya temple from government coffers. In addition to the donations. Dog whistle politics is politics that imply things without outright saying them like use of 'appeasement' which you clearly did. So your getting offended at it, is just funny. To bring up 1984 as a secular government riot won't really help your case since RSS was involved in distributing Trishuls during it, too but go on. But again, I am calling it what it was: state sponsored violence. Police asked Sikhs to give up weapons and when the mob arrived (allowed by the cops) the bloodbath happened. Does that mean you accept Delhi 2020 was State sponsored violence? OP stop being a blind bhakts or just blind. BJP govt had the same thing in place albeit at 2.5 lakhs. Now please give me your opinion about bjp Did you know BJP govt had similar thing in place? So after hearing that information- Are you ok with BJP now? Thats bad and should be removed too. Happy ? True that Ews hai toh Yes very happy. Your approval means the world to me. Muslims have been rulers for last 800 years I sincerely hope it’s atleast EV Lol eventually this Govt will also get hated by people when everyone sees that there is absolutely no change in the amount of corruption the state sees, negligible development and problems due to increase in the fiscal deficit. Fiscal deficit itself isn't bad but there is a limit to spending tax payer money on such schemes. A few schemes are okay, you do your bit from your poll promises people are happy and move on. If you keep doing it over and over again the educated voters will get tired of it eventually. They will know that the Govt is spending on subsidies but not as much in development. Karnataka's voters have always been smart they will vote you out if they see you are not bringing a change. I dont want to discredit INC I admired their campaign and it was a good victory but the BJP govt was so incompetent that many people voted INC out of their frustration. INC will alienate many voters by some of the things they keep doing (Priyank Kharge's sanatan dharma remark for example). Everyone is free to think the way they want about what sort of economic policies are better but I firmly believe that the only way to empower people is to educated them, industrialize and give people opportunities to become prosperous. You might argue that this particular scheme will achieve similar results but you must look at how big of a dent this would have on the treasury. Money doesn't grow on trees it will come from increased property and road taxes, excise and what not. I am more than happy to pay more of all of that but only if I saw it going into projects that have some visible impact on our economy. Sugar-in-milk parsis lmao😂😂😂 Church It was mentioned in your own article approximately 35% of all the donation which also includes maintenance . From you own article >budget of Rs 300 crore has been made for the construction of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple and the access road to Ayodhya Dham, a provision of Rs 100 crore has been proposed for the development and beautification of tourism facilities in Ayodhya. they collected 5500 crore. Let me remind you those 5500 crore remaining amount of 3500 crore will go into hands of government controlled trust .2000 crore will go Into construction of the temple . They also collect 24000 crore from just 6 temples donation I have a question guys as a foreigner: In the western world there's seemingly this trend to decrease car use and invest more in public transit, is it also practiced in India? >How much does it cost to maintain dilapidated structures At least 3.6 cr for church and at least 10 crore for mosque Source >Or build newer ones? I guess in negative bcz temples generate revenue for government just top 6 temples trust collect 20k crore While the indian government does invest heavily in public transit like metros, rrts, railways ,buses . There is no such trend to decrease car use . The government neither encourages cars nor discourages it .public transit is being developed at a faster pace so maybe in near future Everything is happening at the same time . No it's any commercial vehicle How are these sentiments being upvoted??? Thanks for replying I hope the Indian government will realize the huge benefits of public transit and the massive downfalls of car use, and won't repeat the mistakes USA has done (tearing away huge parts of their cities and designing them mainly for cars). >hope the Indian government will realize the huge benefits of public transit I am sure government have already realised that's the reason they keep spending heavily on railways and metros . There used to be only 5 metro cities in India in just last 10 years it became 15 and many more are under construction it's just that we are crowded everywhere . So they can't really discourage the use of cars for now at least Because we live in a BJP led world and all we do is hate. What a fucking Dumbo, how about during independence which community was richer ( a 100x richer?). Nizams? Yeah made up the entire 9 percent of India population. I guess the Muslim rulers did a much better job than the governments after independence, even though they ruled the country but they didn't let the muslims horde all the money. Something to think about. No you get it people never had wealth it was always was with kings and few traders. Yeah so what's the relevance of you commenting so called 800 years of Muslim rule and likely 200 years of Christian rule. Still doesn't change the fact that minorities are extremely oppressed in India. And the last 10 years are worse than the 30 years before that. That your premise was false. Sure hate mongering scum Bhakt. Your time is up. What will I have to oay jizya again or kayamat is near? No, you'll find they no one cares about religion and that'll frustrate you. If possible, on a personal level, bigots like you should be sent back to Nepal/s There is a pole in my village that sinks couple of inches every year. When it sinks completely, there will be kayamat. Isa will ride again and kill followers of Iblis. Let's not forget more pollution and consumption of petrol coz these minorities won't practice oil saving etiquettes (even well read majorities don't) All the fuckcar enthusiasts, this is for auto taxi goods vehicles. Not cars. Abe dumbo… this is not a Congress policy… this policy has existed from much before… was there even during BJP times Also it is not just for religious minorities, it is also available for SC/STs. Lmao. One state has given a few lacs to repair churches. Even houses aren't able to complete maintenance repairs in that budget. Literal spare change thrown at churches is considered minority appeasement? 3.6 crore divide by 76 churches? It costs that much to repair one building. Here are some figures for temples across Indian states I am not against temple maintenance and repair work undertaken by the government. If the people want that then let it be done. But why deny that the government takes away money and doesn't contribute anything towards temple upkeep? You compare 3 to 5 lacs spent on a church to the crores spent on temple upkeep? Remember the bigger temples earn lots of money. But that money is also used indirectly to attend to the other smaller temples in less glamorous places which don't get the same levels of donation. In churches, money from the richer parishes in Mumbai is collected and sent to the less richer parishes who cannot afford upkeep on their own without any government support. Even the donations sent towards Ayodhya had plenty of political parties and politicians contributing through their ill gotten wealth i.e. tax payers money. The first contro was indeed made by the Indian president. Directly and indirectly money from tax payers is funding the temples. Amd that's fine. That's what the people want so let them have it. There is no large act of violence which isn't state sponsored. Or even its started, it can be easily curbed if they want. I mean you say RSS was involved in 1984, okay they may have been. But there was absolutely no reason for any riots with Muslim involved? Each and every riot that has happened in India is because of Hindu and RSS and the BJP, right? Infact all you managed to do is keep on shifting goalposts. You fail to counter a point, then you start a new topic. All I get from your arguments is that you are frothing from the mouth and ranting up things because things don't align with how you have been thinking. >3.6 crore divide by 76 churches? It costs that much to repair one building. Here are some figures for temples across Indian states Church don't contribute to the revenue they still get these, temples contribute to the government revenue Here they increased it to 5 crore . These are just 2 states all states have these >Directly and indirectly money from tax payers is funding the temples. Amd that's fine False , they contribute on their own will no one is forcing people one news was there where an government employee was forcing others to donate without any government order he was booked . Temple contribute at least 40000cr to the government annually government spends lesser than they earn from temples as per your source All states have these types of funds to upkeep the church Lol. It's pretty clear who is frotting at the mouth. The comment is projection at its finest. Your refusal to not believe in welfare schemes including social with the economic is not on me. You just thought if you bring up a lot of topics, I will not be able to shut you up. But you got cornered on every whataboutery. So it is me who is moving goalposts: projection. Your dog whistle politics is pretty clear so is the apologism for BJP. I don't have the interest or the crayons to engage further. Have the day you deserve. See what I mean, now once again you changed the whole point of conversation. Its clear all your narrative is just apologism for Congress. Tell me congress didn't sponsor any state backed riots. Or they were absolutely best in terms of governance. Wait they led to India on brink of default so we had to bed the IMF for loan to survive. Great economists we had. And the great socio economic policies sure worked wonders. We have no poor at all before 2014. Its only BJP that made India poor. And once again, you showed all your comments are about blaming me for things you are engaging in. You brought up BJP. I didn't bring up Congress. But somehow me responding to a comment about BJP with BJP in the comment is changing the point. We have more debt today than we had since Independence to 2014 so your argument is not based on numbers but rhetoric. The national debt stood at ₹155.6 lakh crore (57.1% of GDP) as of 31 March, 2023. It was ₹58.6 lakh crore (52.2% of GDP) on 31 March 2014, just before the current government came to power. Try again with someone who doesn't get his education from WhatsApp University. For a change, shove that into your ass instead of Modi's dick You brought out politics into this. Not me. I don't support your party, so I am evil. American debt stood at 122% of their GDP. Japan's at 233%. Its clear who is visiting WhatsApp university. First the mulla who told me this will have get of it. Why is it false but? Their own money is tax payers money especially with the corruption involved. Do politicians contribute to all religions places of worship? >Temple contribute at least 40000cr to the government annually government spends lesser than they earn from temples as per your source< Where? Nothing of this sort is mentioned. 40000cr is the total value of the temple economy. Including the tourism income of the area from hotels, markets and food places and the other industries based on the temple economy. It isn't the value of income from donations. Here is an article about authority of temples that I found informative. Particularly this part I found >The assumption in the ‘free temples’ argument seems to be that the state government can make money off the temples as the respective Acts lay down rules on how the coffers of the temples should be managed. This, however, is not really true for any state. Any donations given to a temple — whether from collections in the hundi, or given privately — go into its bank account. The temples’ budget needs the HR&CE Department’s approval to utilise some funds, however, these funds can only be used for activities related to the temples, and cannot – by law – be pocketed by the officials appointed by the government to the temple trusts and boards.< So going by this, how can temple donations be withdrawn by the government for other purposes when it is mandatory to be used for purposes which benefit the temple itself? Later on it is mentioned that historically the reason government control even exists in temples in the south atleast is because in the past, the private authorities would bar lower caste communities from worshipping or taking up trustee positions in the temple. So lower caste communities complained and government stepped in. If private trusts want back control then they will have to be different from the past. But will your dad be able to take it in at this age?"
