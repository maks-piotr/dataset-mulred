        "Agree with you. The whole point of a country is to grow together. A more prosperous region contributes to the development of the other. What is happening here is that more prosperous states are giving money to the poorer ones to simply burn the money. No development is happening there. So instead of growing together, some of us are robbing the others. No way is that fair to the tax payers from the southern states and now with the new delimitation (which is anyway illegal as promised by Indira gandhi) the southern states will be left with no voice.  Why not make the tax being paid to center proportional to the population as well?",

        "The whole point of taxing is to uplift poor from distributing it from rich and the way it seems historically Bihar and up have always failed to choose better and still remain poor, and yeah southern states are relatively rich, but even we have our fair share of problems and according to you number of people should decide who will be at centre then there should be no contribution of our taxes to the up and Bihar where they simply burn money, rather we will use it to solve our own own problems, hope you understand.",
        "I don't agree with you. They might be poor but they are less poorer than they were decades ago. All that is because of govt expenditure and development. If the richer states keep their tax money then the poor states will take a lot longer to get out of poverty. Again if you think that people from bihar are sub humans then that is a whole other can of worms.",
        "One man, one vote. This is absolutely correct. \nCurrently a person in south India gets more representation than a person in North. If north has more population, they should get more representation.\n\nThe undemocrats who are saying each state gets same seats how is that a democracy? It's not UN. So Mizoram with 40 lakhs population should get same number of seats as Tamil Nadu with a few crores of population?\n\nAnd if a new state is created, suddenly that state should add more seats even though no population has changed?\n\nNo wonder, Indians are so uneducated by global standards that we make such stupid statements.",

So the argument that they will keep producing babies does not hold. \n\nSouth India has industries and investment and easy access to shipping lines, that's a power many Northern states will never have. South will have the advantage even after delimitation. That whole argument that south will suffer is nothing but a plain lie. \n\nThe voting system is based on people not gdp or land.",

How is this fair? In fact the states that failed to reduce the population should be punished, not rewarded. \n\n\n\nAlso, on a separate note; a super diverse country like India should devolve more power to the states so some majority does not trample over the diversity of others. \n\nFollow a system similar to the American one where the states get only two senators , regardless of their population/size",

That's not a hard concept. \n\n> How on earth that is fair?\n\nHow is it fair that Southern India and the North East got conquered far less than the North did on account of their geography? \n\nHow is it fair that Northern and Eastern India faced the vast majority of atrocities during colonisation and, consequentially, started of far worse off than Southern India did on independence? \n\nHow is it fair that Bengal and Punjab were partitioned, and as a result, faced severe socio-economic problems that impact them even to date? \n\nHow is it fair that Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha lose out on the benefit of their key mineral resources (and the South in particular gains) on account of the freight equalisation policy - a policy that has had devastating consequences on Eastern India and has now been acknowledged for its terrible consequences on our states? \n\nThe South has faced a lot of advantages on account of its geography and central government policy that the North and East hasn't - that's one of the key drivers for its success. So let's acknowledge that maybe. \n\nUP and Bihar in particular, started off, with far lower HDI indices than the South did - it's not a surprise that the South is more successful as a result. \n\nYour rationale is similar to the rationale people use when arguing that poor people shouldn't have the right to vote. Biharis aren't less valuable than Keralites because there are more Biharis than Keralites. \n\nMost people here would take umbrage at the suggestion that Indians are inherently less valuable than Australians because there are more of us than there are Australians - yet are somehow comfortable making that argument internally.

Tyranny of the majority: In a population-based democracy, larger countries with greater populations would have a disproportionate amount of voting power. This could lead to a situation where the majority can easily dominate and oppress the minority. The needs and perspectives of smaller countries or marginalized communities within larger countries might be overlooked or disregarded, resulting in an imbalance of power and potential discrimination.\n2. Diminished representation for smaller countries: In a population-based democracy, smaller countries with lower populations would have limited political influence. Their concerns and interests might be overshadowed or ignored by larger countries, leading to a lack of representation and an undermining of their sovereignty. This could create a sense of frustration and powerlessness among citizens of smaller countries.\n3. Inequitable resource distribution: With voting power directly tied to population size, larger countries may exert more control over resource allocation. This could result in a disproportionate distribution of resources, where larger countries benefit at the expense of smaller ones. Smaller countries might struggle to secure their fair share of resources, leading to economic disparities and potential social unrest.\n4. Homogenization of policies and perspectives: A democracy based solely on population might lead to a convergence of policies and perspectives. Larger countries with greater voting power could dominate decision-making processes, resulting in a homogenization of ideas, values, and cultural practices. This could erode diversity and stifle innovative solutions, as alternative viewpoints and unique perspectives are marginalized or suppressed.\n5. Lack of accountability and corruption: Concentrated power in larger countries can increase the risk of corruption and a lack of accountability. Political leaders and representatives from more populous countries might be less responsive to the needs and concerns of individual citizens. They may prioritize their own interests or those of influential groups, leading to a loss of trust in the democratic process and further exacerbating social inequalities.\n6. Disenfranchisement and voter apathy: In a population-based democracy, citizens from smaller countries might feel marginalized and disenfranchised. This could result in voter apathy, as individuals feel that their votes hold little weight in determining outcomes. Disengagement from the political process can lead to a lack of public participation, making it easier for powerful interests to manipulate the system for their benefit.",

However, this will drastically reduce the power Southern States have in National politics, that too for being good at population control through sensible governance. \n\n2) Emulate a US style system.

As of now, none of the Southern States have the BJP ruling government. As of now, even 6-7% of people in Maharashtra don't vote for the BJP, they can easily lose the majority, and not get 270+ seats. It doesn't matter what you think, what I'm saying has been happening for the past 75 years with Congress, and now BJP. Even Congress lost 2014 elections because the Southern States voted for BJP/Non Congress parties. Southern States are king makers, or at least a lot relevant. \n\nBJP's (NDA) vote share in the 2019 election was 45%, Congress (UPA) was 29%, now BJP got 330+ seats and Congress got 98 seats. BJP got almost all of the Northern States from Rajasthan to  Bihar. That's a fair enough game and you are right, but as of now, say Maharashtra and Karnataka voted Congress/Others, Bengal voted TMC, all this will lead to NDA losing 90+ seats and the PM Post. From 330, it will be 240, and from 98, it will be 188. The point is not who's winning, but with the number game.\n\nNow with the new system, say 440 seats are required to win the elections, following 2023 trend, UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh will vote BJP, and say Karnataka, Orissa and the group votes congress or state parties, which they will mostly do and did in 2019 (apart from Karnataka), BJP will have 420 seats without even a SINGLE seat from the south, not even single seat from Maharashtra or West Bengal, that's what is scary.\n\nRepresentation is important, BJP can just listen to Spotify when a Southern State speaks or Protests. And about Hindi imposition and constitution, well, constitution says that if there is a case against a MLA/MP, he/she has to give up his parliament seat, especially if it's a special case like terrorism or POSCO Act, now Brij Bhushan, Wrestler protest guy, has a case of POSCO against him, and last time I checked, he was outside new parliament, as a MP.\n\nAnother constitution thing: Use of religious symbols while election is illegal, and such MP would be banned, and last time I checked Owaisi was telling Muslims to vote because they are Muslims, and a MLA in Karnataka was asking to vote him if the voter was a Brahman. Nothing has happened to them. \nAccording to the constitution, Money Laundering was banned, but BJP introduced electoral bonds, which allows business man to give money to political parties without any screening, in short, it's money laundering with extra steps, with the bill, even a Pakistani Company can make a fake account in India and pay Owaisi or whoever they want to pay. The Constitution has been changed, and can be changed against the minority. Happened in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Singapore, South Africa, Israel, USA (abortion thingy in Texas).\n\nYou really don't understand democracy or our constitution if you are saying:\n\n \"W.r.t. your random dreams of hindi imposition- the constitution has a basic structure that cannot be changed. Stop dreading. \"\n\nLanguage is still not a \"Fundamental Right\" in our constitution, so legally Hindi Imposition is not impossible. BJP even drafted a bill, but was taken back after RSS leaders from Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu reacted to it. \n\nSO YES, HINDI IMPOSITION IS POSSIBLE LEGALLY.

The southern had 10.\n\nA better proposal would be an EU like system, where each state is given enough power to be administered on its own. The Federal union then can serve for top court, overall broad administration aspects and military, organizations like NASA etc.. \n\nBecause each state has more right to the budget it makes, each state will be forced to earn more for themselves.\n\nThe argument would be northern states having to fend off enemy nations, but south can compensate by managing maritime forces or navy and reserve armies. Also the issue with water management (how much share each state gets, business/trade laws/rules amongst states).\n\nThe current opposition is because , as 1 party gets strong in few states with more parliament seats , they ignore the development of others and if needed would outright oppress the states where they don't need to win.

Should have happened decades ago.\n\nIn fact even the Chinese SEZ system is a specialized version of this strategy. The principle is same (smaller administrative Units having greater Political-Economic-Policy autonomy and inter-unit/State/SEZ competition driving development).\n\nIndia could not do mass-migration from inland heartland to coastal areas (the idea Andra will accept 30-40-50 Million North Indians across generations to come to their cities is just silly in Indian context because the Central Govt and Indian State at large is a Weak State on such affairs).\n\nSo the next best thing it can be is what LKY said to both Indian PMs and Maharashtra Govts of past, break cities like Mumbai and let them keep 100% of their revenue. Rest of the state has to raise their game and not freaking suck the bigger cities for survival. \n\nThis breeds incompetence and lethargy over time into the System. Why do more when the incentive is not to do beyond basic.\n\nBreak Administrative units into smaller sizes, and see local driven people (like mayors, etc) thrive.\n\nCentralization works when the System is tuned for that and there is capacity (like China). India is centralized on paper but in reality in capacity it's banana republic levels of incompetent on Centralization. So either reform this (it can't) or allow smaller units greater autonomy (States can't even do many aspects of direct business/relations with Foreign companies/countries without Center's approval.

There were also two similar (but smaller) agitations in 1968 and 1986 which had varying degrees of success. \n\n    Wealthier states should pay more tax. \n\nI don't deny that? Nor do I deny they should get less share. Why for 70years the two states are still medieval? If development actually took place with the tax money these 7decades, then the expectation today would have been all states are becoming near par such that all pay tax near equally and also get equal development back.\n\n    Also weird way to denigrate a language for no reason. \n\nLike how sasta-Urdu don't have standards prescribed and can't decide whether to be sasta prakrit or sasta farsi? How much Hindi literature is there that isn't Urdu first? And you guys denigrate people speaking broken sastaUrdu. Empty vessels make most noise, need most validation, need to impose most. Are you even Bengali lol. Not a day goes by without being forced to listen to some sastaUrdu outside Hindustani states",
        "Like coastal invasions never happen lol. If anything thats more effective. Nordic invasions into Greece and Russia, US coming to Japan and European shores in enemy territories. Hell our own Chola Empire ruled much of SEA. Even Pala or some Eastern ones had success. It just you all who suck. As if there was no pirate raids from Singapore and Hormuz.",

state wrong say developed state developed state nonsensical youd completely underrepresenting people bihar constituency generally number voters thats one fundamental premises functional democracy otherwise people represented others say someone whos deeply opposed bjp whose state bengal fewer proportion voters result stronger federal structure balance statecentre relationship less skewed people

population issue instead providing representation act encouragement incompetent political class suppose every state encourages populate allow illegal migration country whole would fail lead sheer exploitation illiteracy northern states rinkiya k paapa children congress says example us number senators per state regardless population hence saying functional democracy system us regularly enables president elected despite millions people voting opponent allows minority voters block legislation enabled things like slavery jim crow laws continue long majority voters opposed system worth emulating imo vast majority parliamentary democracies regularly update number representatives based population given parliamentary democracy thats really point reference incidentally us house representatives well imo key part last time based population since states done well population control didnt saying rewarding states failed seats means power earth fair yeah key part arguing disenfranchisement underrepresentation millions people im claiming arguments objective truth im saying theyre think morally correct im seeing arguments contrary thread otherwise seem compelling chain theres person calling upites biharis north indians rats vast majority parliamentary democracies regularly update number representatives based population none diverse us population increase isnt skewed us one shoe fits minute thought congress would win half seats key part argument rewarding incompetence lack governing getting number mps underrepresenting disenfranchisement punished competence good

us australians yet somehow comfortable making argument internally pretty pathetic lmaoi trying make point atleast would promote states develop make babies also wouldnt maharastra mumbai think goa tops list gdp per capita called democracy rather prefer socialismfacism move north korea hope youd okay fact political parties south push respective states make babies increase clout parliament shouldnt case youre voted people size based area states getting number mps underrepresenting disenfranchisement people represented mp people represented mp underrepresenting latter group please explain states performed well population control getting punished democracy representation reward punishment incentive perform improve get underrepresented except fact lower populations connected better educational healthcare economic outcomes thats reward slackers get rewarded realise youre talking individual people right bihar poorer state kerala poverty directly related population rates theyre going recognise benefit lower tfr brings said lot indian states need encourage child programme minimum lot states otherwise massive population crunch incoming tfr puts us pretty terrible situation line lot states

joking population control literally national policy yeah fact told control population like states listened right thing punished since way going south gon na deemed irrelevant terms od national policy since party could focus states win central elections easily thats bad also south nothing special north east west gujrat goa maharashtra small states top dont see states getting insecure yes states arent culturally linguistically ideologically different example southern states population based model might work culturally homogenous countries like eastern europe africa country like creates major problem us horrible system leads two party system options clearly seen us today germany much better system arent simply increasing seats disproportionately increasing seats based population growth southern states absolutely say national policy party wins big margin states biggest population bjp would likely current scenario classic tyranny majority representation tyranny isnt oc didnt say google tyranny majority dont understand tfr falling really low govt work increase nothing wrong dude seriously think india needs fucking increase population state getting low tfr southern states enough rate maintain population states like bihar quite literally breeding like rabbits southern states arent made insignificant theyre economically successful better hdi indices bangalore hyderabad two focal points indias revolution chennais one four metros politically bjp doesnt make inroads anymore say electing union government would brutal maths might sound electorally less likely bjp winning large chunks bihar mp maharastra large chunk bengal rajasthan gujarat seats regions reflective political standings today isnt even including karnataka dicey long run stay sangh control still pockets bjp support likes tn andhra states kerala become insignificant fundamental democratic basis country think things like language imposition northern states easily numbers pass law make hindi national language one example equal representation except advocating youre asking unequal representation based population cool system last years changed sudden count pakistan developed rest states arent close central states form language ideology unfortunately population reality kicking decision many decades yes parties might focus states every time highly likely yogi pm give rajyasabha us style representation would put safety net least electorally less likely yes politics arent constant though idea disenfranchising people political gain isnt one im ever going support mass protests strengthen federalism absolutely mass protests enforce disenfranchisement northern states easily numbers pass law make hindi national language bihar though wouldnt vote whole mp rajasthan chhattisgarh delhi wouldnt create majority gujarati politicians wouldnt vote itd political suicide ditto maharashtra punjab bengal assam odisha etc vast majority politicians northern western eastern north eastern southern states would necessity vote theyd punished electorate wan na lose southern support governments already dont give fuck ne ngl gon na backfire like hell long run wed masterstroke bihar getting decided parts didnt say close said vastly different southern states important difference problem history proven time two ideologically incompatible factions exist cue north south india majority given unchecked power minority gets oppressed horribly either leads genocide civil war nothing done fix problem haryana balanced lot flaws equal visibility sure want tripura seats house sure every time group people need get seats allotted need split state boom x seats ever complained people nagaland x less influence compared people maharashtra concern heavier population growth bihar want give folks lesser voting rights compared south indian would also like make muslim vote important hindu vote given higher population growth person nation one vote vote equal value argument beyond either reflection political leanings desire specific region special status country fuck shit really im noida way bihar get representation fucking shitholes india braindead political class underdeveloped lawless areas run country effectively rule states properly club whole north india together indeed hindi speaking states call north get advantage process reality given current political situation india likely hindi speaking states get super sized representation south wont thats us campaign states ones possibly flip one republicans democrats let tell bihars fertility rate southern states family planning started really better way population numbers always gon na skewed favour north family planning rgerrymandering looks like highlighted ups issue became orange state solve completely agree us system flawed billionaires jerrymander districts gets majority power vote interest people favour billionaires easy brainwash fewer people people would take umbrage suggestion indians inherently less valuable australians us australians yet somehow comfortable making argument internally pretty pathetic bull people uneducated given power vote impose illiteracy educated also democracy works india federal state must fair share representation center equal voting power based state individuals individuals voting rights elect local representative fights state level voice represented national level

bullshit south well historical advantages keralas literacy rate close independence bihars south isnt innately superior ravaged much expecting two equal levels development absurd ignores reality history dhruv rathee made video couple years back ig said exact thing reduce south states importance altogether population looking present present north removing basic facts education want infiltrating south push nonsense maybe south begin push independence central start moving things state list concurrent list present north removing basic facts education ncerts central institution northern one maybe south begin push independence okay try lets pretend like southern states dont benefit part union want benefits union want pretend like indians poorer states arent part country thats problem constituency generally number voters thats one fundamental premises functional democracy otherwise people represented others provide source assumption fundamental democracy ill believe toolkit buzzword going around right rwing anything creating checks balances make democracy functional th world population big say un much eu make smaller members insignificant france germany italy spain eclipse member states universal suffrage recent thing needs tweaks called person vote may work homogeneous countries elsewhere theres tackling tyranny majority serf majority constituencies special

fellow south asians global slave trade throughout history many adanis ambanis iranis agrawals patels wadias modis mallyas reddys dont give shit regard equal indians ganges belt useful middleman scapegoat say anything northwestern merchants pays say nothing common indians states besides religion would consider bengali first indian like eu conditions persist india onceabstract recent umbrella use going imperialistic otherwise people represented others ethnolinguistic states represented others good job people representation low level constituencies federal level agree although might higher seats gon na years decades come think india single country union states representation theyll make better conditions improve education need good leader doesnt relate education theyll obviously highly educated people advise help time want give delhi control partitioning people like british punjab bengal literally congress partitioned apts local regionalists wanted partition much like hm ml punjab bengal majority remember parliament vidhan sabha active overnight apts partition due majority concensus lot unparliamentary activities took place northie congress could secure partition upcoming elections similar unparliamentary story happened noconfidence motion around indous nuclear deal merchants paying several parties party members backstab ignore representatives wanted thats another story long delhi gets sort obnoxious power centre eastern southern states issues keep happening opposition headed north india tangible value routing incumbent north indian ruling party make rahul nitish pm still impose gareebiurdu east south like pakistan bangladesh theyll still demand tax south flush northern sinkhole west bengal doesnt even produce much capital anymore yet get central expenditures either forget development mamata run around get states share tax centre pay pensioners real shame incumbent party become powerful within opposition sentiment become incrahul terrible state duopolistic democracy today reject bjp inc equally modi bas jhaki hai yogi abhi baki hai circa us system every state sears rajya sabha atleast pretty sure south instead pissed tax rightfully taken wrongfully wasted sinkholes time time change development ideally north gotten developed central expenditure could allocate states equally fyi north best industries mechanical engineering post partition got ruined northwestern merchants started dropshipping items china make quick buck products would used get exported even enjoy good reception texas small state seats ny even florida seats ny plus abortion ban doesnt affect blue states since free form policy liberally want red states dont comply federal mandate anymore fact people red state travel blue states want abortion later time pregnancy pretty sure south instead pissed tax rightfully taken wrongfully wasted sinkholes time time change development ideally north gotten developed central expenditure could allocate states equally fyi north best industries mechanical engineering post partition got ruined northwestern merchants started dropshipping items china make quick buck products would used get exported even enjoy good reception bro youre saying stuff give alternative didnt check username thought person hope delhi continues push east south like pak bangladesh northie bhajpa northie congress comes matters redditors young experience delhi imperialist stuff going decades personally see state first umbrella called india north india roleplaying british raj commonality states religion color might identified indian things becoming equal would supported person vote even newer non federal constitution democracy ethnolinguistic federalism lost relevance instead moving towards nonfederal hindunorthie constitution upcoming decades people stay silent states already reorganised ethnolinguistic lines post independence moving eu loose union instead would solution solutions favour delhi best slows inevitable delhi imperialism south treated bloc hence focus delhi already sown discord maithlis odia bengalis assamese bangladesh sovereign east cant considered bloc bihar even north indian state youre gon na trigger people simped delhi since independence mithlanchal areas considered east entire bihar jharkhand dhanbad ranchi north indian jamshedpur inbetween doubt bjp centric thing dislike nitish rahul pm would still impose gareebiurdu south east like pakistan imposed urdu bangladesh delimitation frozen years might worse although would improving delimitation wasnt frozen however put india unless list exact control two states show causation major chunk causation panindia decline income inequality work hours less famines women empowerment countries africa really homogeneous abortions well red states average person doesnt even case emergency majority times poor get pregnant someone born delhi brought speak experience clearly remember prominent govt programmes hum hamare loosely translated husband wife kids gap minimum years birth children think central government programmes say ads aired quite frequently radio tv given sheer size bihar terms population years back would say mathematically reduction fertility rates states majorly drove fertility rates whole countrythat youre looking statewise contribution rather socioeconomic reasons actual answer imo decentralizing power even delimitation done based population central government doesnt get much stuff might affect different regions differently course current dispensation wants exact opposite obvious reasons split least states proposed decades never taken seriously wow delicious debate last thank put forth views forward educated rest us yea wont till around solve southern states representation issue still parliament germanys system complicated half politicians even wouldnt understand also germany diverse country usa india way say southern states agree yes barbaric restrict individual rights todays time especially overall abortions us going enhanced access contraceptives course religious fanatics try stop fck tyranny govt need save india fron dictatorship youre terming people majority minority based vote lol religion complex bihar hindutva dosent exactly play big role caste big factor bihar dalit barred entering brahmin village peoples proud itso obvious bjp didnt majority start distributing wrt gdp let us see happens next trying understand population policies believe possible solution step allocate seats according population shown chart step penalisereward states proportionally performance population policies stats especially standard deviations mediansaverages used effectively penalise states done significantly worse metric method two things allocate seats roughly according population democracy incentivise governments control population get penalised since bihar already way ahead expected populations initially heavily penalised smoothened overtime populations effectively managed throwing ideas im interested learn solutions anyone atleast rajya sabha state given seats way south non hindi states voice national politics solutions useless way go forward break high population states arey two programmes done panindia asking specific cases implementation cultural failure mentioned women given freedom work states unlike system working husband housewife women empowerment reduces growth effectively familiar bicameral system indian parliament upper house rajya sabha balance power hate laughing even bihar regions extremely populated throughout history argument based false assumption states evenly equally populated bihar somehow changed worse bihar bengal always densely highly populated regions world forever well would localised diverse politics party would able dominate entire region thus wouldnt domination country federal structure country including southern states would protected political diversity north almost like founding fathers foresaw problem thats rajya sabha zero originality sad needed use convey opinions plus shows oblivious implementation failure fertility rates went roughly decrease power assembly going based population states also broken smaller pieces based population limits applying policy single part setup cause huge inequalities state least literacy literate ministers gets make big decisions sad future india gon na grow like look south indian perspective govt encourages people control population south india complies every year see tales corruption bihar dont see developing even though tax contributions dumped cause complied govt earlier reduce population get even less representation southern states form union secede yes youre right problem actually regions lower seat share parliament end neglected numbers simply matter less isnt north vs south bjp congress even tables turned south overwhelming majority seats compared hindi belt would still problem two reasons becomes problem indias diversity lack federalism india federation states individual state governments limited powers still depend central govt funds resources means people also dependent central govt state govt secondly laws passed favour one region might best interests regions since state governments dont really choice follow laws implemented even peoples wishes thats representative democracy works tu ban ja point might well divide tamil nadu since southern state able speak south india like tamil nadu acts like represents whole south india like regions worse south like bengal north eastern states nonhindi speaking states dude uttarakhand split vajpayee govt level governance much better compared completely support split states party wants risk chances electoral college benefits smaller states grossly oversimplifying course party try get seats everyone given infinite money state funds limited netas power try impress poor voters north belt freebies limited money amount improvement quality life south definitely suffer kamal ka fool desh ki sabse badi bhool arent u sad one look around environmental variables try disprove argument instead trying answer head gpt also provided counter arguments selectively chose put plus bored using chat gpt time thought check thinks really wanted attack ur character could brought fact u committed greatest sin reddit gives rise another kind fuckery btw quarantined people breading like hamsters south soon take india tfr behind curtains simple solution devolution bihar contribute taxes get back least incentive work improve secondly major states contribute immensely economy like maharashtra tn etc special ministry focusing development esp infrastructure funded completely delhi otherwise china biggest beneficiary coming fiasco like pre revolution france aristocrats power democracy cons pros would pro bihar educated enough still ill say basic definition democracy imo country million people us states indians million states doesnt make sense think break states smaller parts especially bigger ones like maharashtra ensure single cm wont kingmaker looking yogi also making easier govern pc agree breaking states parts much tax paying logic ambani supplied facilities pays tax distribute richs wealth poors would ask basic research commenting indias fertility rate replacement level southern states fertility rates either replacement level actually need work increasing fertility rate meanwhile fertility rate bihar need work reducing fertility rate well south india separate nation id argue isnt wont lets see every rs south indian pays tax receive rs back centre government upbihar every rs tax paid get approx rs back centre ambani doesnt pay highest tax need look ratio earns pays tax country runs middle class people earning upto k month paying taxes religiously rich means evading taxes convert wealth buying artwork shell companies leave nation rot current loksabha seat distribution southern states seats bihar seats total seats southern states seats bihar seats nonsense op th finance commission clearly giving importance states better population control kind imaginary picture posted rile rivalry nonsense one wants population going sync development go high manage based population regions need representatives need hour eventually things change time matter many states protest happen eventually soon coming years hope understand nation building south india developed isnt india considered developed nation every state fair representation nation building bihar supplying crucial human resource entire nation understand people bihar ofter miss use allotted share still people dont access toilets electricity hospitals etc bihars fault left poor hdi time independence geographical location rich plains made heartland targetinvasion cant compare times change much possible near future states responsible economic activities assuming people become honest people southern states migrate employment nothings permanent yogiji bulldozed mansion laughed joke want justice understand hearing undesirable things places come may feel repulsive question reducing voice southern people democracy important nation building instead viewing fodder shouldnt punished leading example years independence us given states means mandir masjid wala drama geography care people feel bihar jharkhand means eastern indian states mean anything karnataka north lmao north identity exclusive rajasthan himachal jnk uttarakhand punjab delhi im state mentionedaffected inby argument problematic thing vs mentality also state division best thing especially country like india rich resources high population already know karnataka vs tamil nadu water disputes ap vs telangana mh vs karnataka etcthere numerous opportunity disputes states thus best preserve federal structure country basis population state mere administrative unit dont associate abstract line mapped britishersrulers culturepride yeah theres federal structure isnt flawed way anyone tries pull shit ill streets protesting let arrest beat shit ill still protest unfamiliarity speaking isnt less complicated german system lot similar unlike us system people already easily understand difference general state local elections constituencies individual mp mla etc elected dont see anyone wouldnt understand german system two sets seats one set exactly like single member constituencies whoever gets votes elected set elected based proportional representation state example bjp gets inc gets rajasthan theyll get seats respectively get cast two votes one constituency one proportional worried bihar contribute bjp mistaken bjp tata bye bye khtam bihar caste equation tight favour mahagathbandan interesting furor distribution resources like got want unfair us really think modi allow yogi kingmaker amit shah would allow yogi kingmaker cant allow powerful definitely solution wait lets gooooooo bjp tyranny majority hindi heartland majority never let us assume bjp wins seats present ruling states amounts thats total parliament strength theres one slight issue bjp wont win every single constituency every state ruling right states electoral power slightly decreased end world diminished representation smaller countries ever slightly regional powerhouse states wb tn kerela andhra telangana odisha always voted respective regional parties make karnataka swing state may lean either bjp congress inequitable resource distribution exact opposite india doesnt make sense homogenization policies perspectives centerstate disputes would never allowed india always welfare state theres really much homogenization ideas policies theres high courts temporarily stay order lack accountability corruption government ever accountable disenfranchisement voter apathy every rich prosperous states politically conscious especially wb tn kerela andhra pradesh punjab karnataka voters really issue committed greatest sin reddit nooo wtf wont local government become much responsive isnt check issues us proposed system system state vote population varies hugely issue example southern states less population racist backward northerneast coast states ones big cities like washington new york huge population people accepting diversity vote one southern state thing southern states population northern states population northern states population betterprogressive policies still lose votes southern better proposal would eu like system state given enough power administered federal union serve top court overall broad administration aspects military organizations like nasa etc state right budget makes state forced earn argument would northern states fend enemy nations south compensate managing maritime forces navy reserve armies also issue water management much share state gets businesstrade lawsrules amongst states current opposition party gets strong states parliament seats ignore development others needed would outright oppress states dont need win completely spirit idea india nation never happen southern states would reason stay indian union happen one stupid firangi language alert shoo go back pakistan hindustan united states awadh speaking tamilan even pissed tax money goes north frustrated convergence social indicators despite proportion tax shares south increasing consistently time give us development show money used properly uplift people agree hence rebuttal view electoral college would cause even trouble india proposal breaking states manageable pieces benefits would decentralisation ease governance north still dominate national politics idea kingmaker states dissolved like gives birth smaller states would eventually start cycling different political parties fracturing absolute mandate lok sabha elections equal representation states would highly nondemocratic soo dont think good idea bruh dont get people hate soo much way way better indian states idk wheres hate coming frm discriminated basis vs thiers fine democratic dont support becomes british colonial minded peeps hypocritical way life deshbhakt said maybe fix problem giving raj sabha seets south giving power slight upper hand upper

smaller tattipieces becomes nontatti also gets expedited relative single large piece kept similar principle using excrement fertilizer cant dump large amount place literally kill plant break soil absorb without getting overwhelmed minority gerrymandered constituency vote equal vote reasoning behind loksabha constituencies fall flat voters conveniently grouped empower majority cutdown minority fabricating convenient borders first place indeed state breakup solution fact baked constitution automatic soon state falls xy range negotiated principle matters broken half sort done even upi apps getting majority market share hard concept deal happening political shenanigans happen even say new states cms party still would eventually end things selfserving logic politics weakens states power national scale elevates peoples voice net term since representation state center kills multiple problems action happened decades ago fact even chinese sez system specialized version strategy principle smaller administrative units greater politicaleconomicpolicy autonomy interunitstatesez competition driving development india could massmigration inland heartland coastal areas idea andra accept

    "light_cleaned_comments": "No way this should allowed to happen. Whole south india across political lines should protest this. No.of MP's per state should be in same proportion forever. Future proofing an orange future Imagine how the Southern states would have been treated if the Cow region's GDP was higher... South is acting magonimously... Nation must know. I think the best possible solution is to have something like the US system where 1 house of the legislature is proportional to the population and the other gives every state equal representation. This ensures the rights of smaller, less populated states. That would require a major constitutional amendment, which would never pass because it would take 2/3rd majority in both houses I think. Why, it should be based on what majority of people want. I am enjoying good highways right now. Other parties don't have Nitin sir Agree with you. The whole point of a country is to grow together. A more prosperous region contributes to the development of the other. What is happening here is that more prosperous states are giving money to the poorer ones to simply burn the money. No development is happening there. So instead of growing together, some of us are robbing the others. No way is that fair to the tax payers from the southern states and now with the new delimitation (which is anyway illegal as promised by Indira gandhi) the southern states will be left with no voice. Why not make the tax being paid to center proportional to the population as well? If nothing else.. this will certainly break our country. Simple, you dont want to reward incompetence. Why is Goa not a southern state? Winning heartland states will end up ensuring a majority soon. Rajasthan, MP, UP, Bihar, Chattisgarh and jharkhand will easily have about half the MP seats. bruh other states are getting screwed over too, south states are not special. this is bad for all of us. Rajya Sabha can be bypassed with money bills. Poda loosu ponda Exactly. Geographically, it's even below Gunturu in Andhra. People from South doing better than UP Bihar. They will still do better after delimitation. I don't see how its an issue. Unless people there see north indians as sub humans or something else. Also the whole point of tax is from rich to poor. The whole point of taxing is to uplift poor from distributing it from rich and the way it seems historically Bihar and up have always failed to choose better and still remain poor, and yeah southern states are relatively rich, but even we have our fair share of problems and according to you number of people should decide who will be at centre then there should be no contribution of our taxes to the up and Bihar where they simply burn money, rather we will use it to solve our own own problems, hope you understand. I don't agree with you. They might be poor but they are less poorer than they were decades ago. All that is because of govt expenditure and development. If the richer states keep their tax money then the poor states will take a lot longer to get out of poverty. Again if you think that people from bihar are sub humans then that is a whole other can of worms. One man, one vote. This is absolutely correct. Currently a person in south India gets more representation than a person in North. If north has more population, they should get more representation. The undemocrats who are saying each state gets same seats how is that a democracy? It's not UN. So Mizoram with 40 lakhs population should get same number of seats as Tamil Nadu with a few crores of population? And if a new state is created, suddenly that state should add more seats even though no population has changed? No wonder, Indians are so uneducated by global standards that we make such stupid statements. No it was never the discussion about distribution, but the ineffective distribution of money, so that's why the prosperous states should be given more power to form centre to not exploit the taxes, else it's just Bihar ,up and their propaganda game will dry our nation. Ab toh modiji kabhi nahi jayenge üòÅ So according to you literally no development is happening in up bihar? And if you are taking about ineffective distribution then why should rich individuals even pay taxes. Let everyone keep the money. I hope you realise taxes are not just paid for upliftment of poor Per census in the 1970s, it was decided that it is both the center and state's responsibility to get population under control. Few states could achieve it and few couldn't. I request you to please look up the chain of events that have brought us up to this moment. Watch the deshbhakth episode. Akash has a video out on this. It'll help. We're not uneducated, just not informed. Please be respectful in comments mate. There's enough hate already Its one of the uses. No one is suggesting that's all it does. But god forbid some poor people might get a better life in the future. Its all just south vs north. Bro, southern states are angry because they implemented population control policies effectively and the northern states not so much , so why south should be punished for obeying policies introduced by the centre when north get an advantage for ineffective implementation?? Ok can someone share before and after distribution It was never south vs North, it's just claiming for the power we deserve and don't lose it to someone who couldn't have better family planning ,don't tell me you won't do the same dont clump \"north\" into this. states like himachal, punjab, uttarakhand, jnk implemented them too. they are too getting screwed over. the only states benefitting from this arrangement are up, bihar. for fucks sake bihar is not even a north indian state Their fertility rate falling fast. In a decade they will reach near replacement level tfr. Will your opinions change then? Or do you think South India will become poor and they will become rich because of the tax situation. No I hope my entire INDIA will become prosperous if power is distributed according to competence I agree he was rude, but he has a point. Same no of seats makes no sense And how does one attain competence? That means Pm does not even have to rally in the south. He just need to win the Up, Bihar , Mp... those Hindi belts and win the center. Why care about us in south at all Shouldn't it depend on population? By deciding metrics ,one such way GDP growth rate of each state, infrastructure and education investment ,this way there will be direct competition for states to improve to enjoy power, for now I'm not even demanding this, I'm just saying don't dilute the voting power we hold to people who are producing babies like a machine, i wouldn't have said that if I believe up and Bihar have better judgement, but all I'm seeing in my country is religious tensions, public and media trials, if these guys believe our systems are incompetent then it's your fucking job to make it better rather than bringing it down media trial, I see it ironic that up guys belittle Bihar when they are the ones who need real upliftment I just researched - the constitution of the parliament can only be changed by 2/3rd majority and ratification by 51% state legislatures. Seems near impossible right now. Yes non bjp voters are rats Voting power is not diluted. We are still a representative democracy. Your representative will have the same power as any other. And as I already said TFR is already falling rapidly and its only a matter of decade and a few years, and their TFR will reach national levels. So the argument that they will keep producing babies does not hold. South India has industries and investment and easy access to shipping lines, that's a power many Northern states will never have. South will have the advantage even after delimitation. That whole argument that south will suffer is nothing but a plain lie. The voting system is based on people not gdp or land. 'south' is a cultural identity rather than geographic. Similar linguistic and cultural roots are shared by the states and UTs which is different from goa. The point here is that the southern states actually did what the government asked the states to do; reducing the population. UP & others didn't. Now, cos they were effective in implementing population control policies the southern states are getting screwed over. How is this fair? In fact the states that failed to reduce the population should be punished, not rewarded. Also, on a separate note; a super diverse country like India should devolve more power to the states so some majority does not trample over the diversity of others. Follow a system similar to the American one where the states get only two senators , regardless of their population/size Least retarded chaddi squeaks and scam Sharma user There are a lot of bad things that people can do without amending the constitution Bihar is not irth indian? no, the only reason why UP and Bihar have such high population is because it's govt has never been competent enough to facilitate human development, population control, family planning etc. And now that incompetent govt. will have a much greater say in controlling the entire nation now entire india will become like UP Bihar. Ramrajya coming soon to the local govt near you no, its in east india along w jharkhand You're only saying that because you don't like the political party that might win there. It seems to me that if there are more people in a state they should get more representation. Number of MPs should be proportional to population of the state, that's the only way we can ensure that every citizen of india get equal representation at the parliament. Otherwise a person who lives in small state gets more say than someone living in a big state. Aiiiyyeee naaaa humraaa bihar meeee its not fair Orange future is a bad future People do vote and their vote chooses the representative, but the question here is why do the representation of a specific section is higher than the other. The beauty of democracy was that every state played a big role in central government formation, now south India in general seems of lower importance than just 2 state that are highly polarized. Not like there will be any different than what it's today look at past two elections NDA didn't win in southern states . So increasing of lok Sabha will hardly hamper the percentage of seats won by The BJP. And yet somehow south india is still doing better than those two states. And its not going to change in anyway. Not if you ask the orange states Why should backward states with more population be rewarded. So you want states promoting people to reproduce more? Why can't we change it to seats based on GDP per capita? Up and bihar are on the bottom 2 on that list No, that's because the major proportion of taxes paid by the southern states go to these states against our interests. More population means more representation, but Mostly northern states should def contribute to nation something apart from population. Your analogy regarding the small state and big state is wrong, you can say the developed state and under developed state. Nonsensical, you'd be completely underrepresenting the people of UP and Bihar if so. Each constituency should generally have the same number of voters - that's one of the fundamental premises of a functional democracy (otherwise, some people are more represented than others). I say this as someone who's deeply opposed to the BJP and whose state (Bengal) will have a fewer proportion of voters as a result of this. We should have a stronger federal structure, so that the balance between the state-centre relationship is less skewed, but people acting like it's unreasonable for Biharis to have a relatively similar proportion of voters to MPs ratio in parliament as Tamilians have are allowing their political biases to take precedence over more fundamental principles (i.e. one person one vote, people being represented similarly). #Kim Jong Un in the making Imagine the population control and family planning policies of state governments if this is implemented. There will be no reward for politicians to control population. Way to fuck this country even more Meri family mein 4 log gai sabke room k liye different bathroom hai crore rupees k ghar mein rahata hu mst life jeeta hu. what about maharashtra? Equal representation for a state is completely mindless.The NE states (w such low population) can't and should never get equal voting power as a much bigger state w more population. And yeah it is also true that the states that implemented the policies in a better way are being punished BUT IG is one of the drawbacks of democracy which depends on the demographics and w the changing demographics the power (those who control ) also shifts . Democracy is the system w the least drawbacks we have for now but surely not the best > but the question here is why do the representation of a specific section is higher than the other. > > Because they have more people? UP and Bihar have c. 25.79% of India's population, whilst Southern India (by the definition in this chart) have c.20.86%. Is your question seriously why 25.79% of the population gets a proportionately higher number of MPs than 20.86% of the population does? Idk why you're getting so worked up, people just don't want political parties to exploit the people of south and up/Bihar for votes. They want a more sensible way of governance. Just to fulfill political agendas, people shouldn't breed like cattles. **The one person who nobody is talking about right now and will benefit the most from this would be Yogi** as he would have the biggest number of seats from a state, thus sort of playing kingmaker or trying to become king himself. ü§° Why are the orange state on par with developed nations?. They move away from there own state to work, study everything.... Living off tax paid by other state like a leech The Southern states are punished for controlling their population better. Tyranny of the majority. Considering most Redditors here are advocating for representation by population, please be okay with the fact that politicians in the South will push (and are already pushing) their population to produce more babies. Schemes in the likes of countries like SK and Japan will emerge if delimitation happens this way. >Each constituency should generally have the same number of voters - that's one of the fundamental premises of a functional democracy That's not true. For example, The US has the same number of senators per state regardless of the population. It's designed that way so that each state gets the same say in policy making and the larger states can't over rule the smaller states. No, it means a person in the smaller states gets the same say as someone in the bigger states so that winning a bigger state doesn't override the wishes of 5 smaller states. UP and Bihar should be made to face resource crunch for them to fix their population issue. Instead, providing them more representation will only act as an encouragement for the incompetent political class. If suppose, every other state encourages to populate itself more or allow illegal migration then the country as a whole would fail. This will lead to sheer exploitation of the illiteracy in the northern states. Rinkiya k paapa had 6 children because of Congress he says > For example, The US has the same number of senators per state regardless of the population Hence me saying a functional democracy. The system in the US regularly enables for a president to be elected despite millions more people voting for their opponent, and allows for a minority of voters to block legislation (which enabled things like slavery and Jim Crow laws to continue long after a majority of voters opposed the same). It's not a system worth emulating imo. The vast majority of parliamentary democracies regularly update the number of representatives based on population, and given that we're a parliamentary democracy, that's really our point of reference. Incidentally, the US does that in the House of Representatives as well. >imo That is the key part Last time they did it was based on population only. Since then some states done well in population control and some didnt. Now what you are saying is rewarding states which failed with more seats which means more power. How on earth that is fair? Yeah, and your key part is arguing for the disenfranchisement and underrepresentation of millions of people. I'm not claiming my arguments are objective truth, I'm saying they're what I think is morally correct. I'm not seeing any arguments to the contrary in this thread or otherwise that seem compelling - down the chain, there's a person calling UPites, Biharis and North Indians rats. >The vast majority of parliamentary democracies regularly update the number of representatives based on population None of them are as diverse as us. And population increase isnt as skewed as us. Its not one shoe fits all For a minute I thought Congress would win more than half the seats The key part of my argument is not rewarding incompetence and lack of governing. Getting the same number of MPs is not underrepresenting or disenfranchisement, being punished for competence and good governance is. These states performed well on population control and are getting punished for it. There will be no incentive to perform and improve if they get underrepresented and the slackers get rewarded. Exactly Goa is European Each state should have representation based on Central Taxes contributed. It's only fair they should have the representation as to how the national treasury has to be utilised. > Now what you are saying is rewarding states which failed with more seats which means more power. 'Rewarding' Democracy isn't a reward - some people should not have proportionately more representation than others. That's not a hard concept. > How on earth that is fair? How is it fair that Southern India and the North East got conquered far less than the North did on account of their geography? How is it fair that Northern and Eastern India faced the vast majority of atrocities during colonisation and, consequentially, started of far worse off than Southern India did on independence? How is it fair that Bengal and Punjab were partitioned, and as a result, faced severe socio-economic problems that impact them even to date? How is it fair that Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha lose out on the benefit of their key mineral resources (and the South in particular gains) on account of the freight equalisation policy - a policy that has had devastating consequences on Eastern India and has now been acknowledged for its terrible consequences on our states? The South has faced a lot of advantages on account of its geography and central government policy that the North and East hasn't - that's one of the key drivers for its success. So let's acknowledge that maybe. UP and Bihar in particular, started off, with far lower HDI indices than the South did - it's not a surprise that the South is more successful as a result. Your rationale is similar to the rationale people use when arguing that poor people shouldn't have the right to vote. Biharis aren't less valuable than Keralites because there are more Biharis than Keralites. Most people here would take umbrage at the suggestion that Indians are inherently less valuable than Australians because there are more of us than there are Australians - yet are somehow comfortable making that argument internally. It's pretty pathetic. Lmao.i was trying to make a point but atleast it would promote states to develop not make more babies. Also wouldn't it be Maharastra and not Mumbai. I think Goa tops the list in GDP per capita This is called Democracy If you rather prefer Socialism/Facism, move to North Korea I hope you'd be okay with the fact that political parties in the South will push their respective states to make more babies to increase their clout in the Parliament. Shouldn't that be the case? You're being voted in by the most people? What about Size based on Area of the states ? > Getting the same number of MPs is not underrepresenting or disenfranchisement, How is 100 people being represented by 1 MP and 300 people being represented by 1 MP not underrepresenting the latter group? Please explain that to me. > These states performed well on population control and are getting punished for it. Democracy and representation is not a reward or punishment. > There will be no incentive to perform and improve if they get underrepresented Except for the fact that lower populations are connected to better educational, healthcare, and economic outcomes? That's the 'reward'. > and the slackers get rewarded You realise you're talking about individual people right? Bihar is a poorer state than Kerala, poverty is directly related to population rates. They're not going to do that, because they recognise the benefit that a lower TFR brings. That said, a lot of Indian states will need to encourage a 2 child programme at minimum, because a lot of states will otherwise have a massive population crunch incoming (a TFR of under 2 puts us on a pretty terrible situation down the line, and a lot of states are underneath that figure). We need 0 üçä post 2024. Fuck that. It doesn't matter who comes to power. It means that the people of a few states will essentially control power at the center. Any and every political party will misuse it because why not? > None of them are as diverse as us Which has nothing to do with the concept of equal representation? > And population increase isnt as skewed as us Nor is the difference in poverty. > Its not one shoe fits all It's not - hence why some states (including most Southern states) having historical advantages that put them in a better position than others did from the get-go. you make an argument less compelling than a buffoon trying to sell ice cream in the arctic, democracy isnt about \"right\" or \"fairness\" but it is also not just about who can literally 'make more people' btw here goes chat gpt 1. Tyranny of the majority: In a population-based democracy, larger countries with greater populations would have a disproportionate amount of voting power. This could lead to a situation where the majority can easily dominate and oppress the minority. The needs and perspectives of smaller countries or marginalized communities within larger countries might be overlooked or disregarded, resulting in an imbalance of power and potential discrimination. 2. Diminished representation for smaller countries: In a population-based democracy, smaller countries with lower populations would have limited political influence. Their concerns and interests might be overshadowed or ignored by larger countries, leading to a lack of representation and an undermining of their sovereignty. This could create a sense of frustration and powerlessness among citizens of smaller countries. 3. Inequitable resource distribution: With voting power directly tied to population size, larger countries may exert more control over resource allocation. This could result in a disproportionate distribution of resources, where larger countries benefit at the expense of smaller ones. Smaller countries might struggle to secure their fair share of resources, leading to economic disparities and potential social unrest. 4. Homogenization of policies and perspectives: A democracy based solely on population might lead to a convergence of policies and perspectives. Larger countries with greater voting power could dominate decision-making processes, resulting in a homogenization of ideas, values, and cultural practices. This could erode diversity and stifle innovative solutions, as alternative viewpoints and unique perspectives are marginalized or suppressed. 5. Lack of accountability and corruption: Concentrated power in larger countries can increase the risk of corruption and a lack of accountability. Political leaders and representatives from more populous countries might be less responsive to the needs and concerns of individual citizens. They may prioritize their own interests or those of influential groups, leading to a loss of trust in the democratic process and further exacerbating social inequalities. 6. Disenfranchisement and voter apathy: In a population-based democracy, citizens from smaller countries might feel marginalized and disenfranchised. This could result in voter apathy, as individuals feel that their votes hold little weight in determining outcomes. Disengagement from the political process can lead to a lack of public participation, making it easier for powerful interests to manipulate the system for their benefit. Except that they already have started doing it. The Chief Ministers of TN, Telangana and AP have made statements on increasing their population. Read up. You also forget the fact that there's a mass migration of labor from the North to the South. They are usually uneducated, struggle to integrate, and displace existing local labor. This flames concerns amongst the locals on its political and cultural ramifications. All the language politics that are around currently is just the tip of the iceberg. >Democracy isn't a reward - some people should not have proportionately more representation than others. That's not a hard concept. Its not some divine rule that no one can disturb. Its what happeneing last few decades. There is a reason for it. You cant say \"we have to reduce population\" and rewards states which failed to do so. Nope. The percentage of representation for each state should never change. Atleast it should be not based on population growth. > buffoon trying to sell ice cream in the sahara I imagine anyone trying to sell ice cream in a desert would be incredibly successful- so this isn't the diss you think it is. You meant something along the lines of 'your argument is less compelling than someone trying to sell ice to an Eskimo'. If you can't make up good analogies, use the tried and tested ones no, why bother experimenting? Who in there right mind thinks seat allocation should be based on GDP per capita !! (As I read in many comments below) Democracy is always based on equal representation, so like it or not North Indian states will get more seats, as they should. Also, changing structure of government to accommodate south‚Äôs representation demands is not gonna happen. You don‚Äôt get brownie points for controlling population or implementing right policies, no one told you to do so. Also, south is nothing special, there is north east, west we have gujrat, goa and maharashtra, we have small states at the top. You don‚Äôt see these states getting insecure. Now we know where the uncontrolled population growth is. Senate is like Rajya Sabha. Congress which is the US equivalent of Lok Sabha has representation in proportion to population. California has 52 congressmen vs Montana which has 2. Democracy is about 'right' and 'fairness'. Dont know what books you are reading about democracy > The Chief Ministers of TN, Telangana and AP have made statements on increasing their population. Read up. > > Statements during political conflicts do not make for policy. > You also forget the fact that there's a mass migration of labor from the North to the South. They are usually uneducated, struggle to integrate, and displace existing local labor You mean the migration that actively helps Southern Indian states do well economically? > This flames concerns amongst the locals on its political and cultural ramifications Sounds like Southern India wants to have all the benefits of being part of the country, whilst not having any of the disadvantages. You guys keep them out from your States at least. I don't think they'll do it. South States will revolt. Nobody wants to Balkanize after 70 years. oh yea- that's my bad- but when they do hit, they are kinda good, it was supposed to be used in an opposite scenario, lemme fix that for you Kinda true...but it is really unfair that South Indian states which worked hard for decades to improve their social indicators will have a lesser say in our already north Indian centric democracy. You're 100% right but the idea of India isn't preserved if you make the southern states insignificant. And that's what's going to happen functionally. Democracy is about more than just letting the majority do what it wants; that's mobocracy. In a democracy, you have to ensure the rights of the minorities are not trampled by the majority. In my opinion, states should **not** have equal representation. Look at how the Senate functions (for those who don't know, it's a f cking sh tshow and a disgrace to American democracy). Every single constituency should have an equal number of voters, or better yet, we should have a system of proportional representation (citizen votes for a party and not a person and elected MPs aren't assigned to a specific area). South Indian states aren't being \"punished\". They're getting the representation they deserve. You can't really assign the blame on any particular state. These statements create conflicts. Most folks here don‚Äôt realise Bihar isn‚Äôt a BJP ruled state. South India is dragging the laggards. I am sure Kerela and Tamil Nadu are tired of footing the bill for pushp varsha from helicopters on Kanwarias. //Statements during political conflicts do not make for policy.// Clutching at wind. There are no 'political conflicts' - this is just something most parties agree on. Political statements from Chief Ministers usually lead to policy. But yeah, great mental gymnastics to sidestep that. //You mean the migration that actively helps Southern Indian states do well economically?// Exactly, the same economic wealth that the North Indian states suck out and spend building temples and statues. The same economic wealth indeed. //Sounds like Southern India wants to have all the benefits of being part of the country, whilst not having any of the disadvantages.// How bad of South India not to want the benefit of being robbed by the Northern states and the absolute delight of being trampled by linguistic Hindi hegemony? Don't threaten them with good times > You cant say \"we have to reduce population\" and rewards states which failed to do so. Nope. Giving voters an equal amount of representatives is not a reward. > The percentage of representation for each state should never change. Atleast it should be not based on population growth. Lol - despite the fact that the current proportions were literally based on population. If it happens than I hope south India revolts Why is it unfair? You're presuming a PM elected by group A won't serve group B. Prime ministers lead the country, not a group of people/states. You realize that UP is 4th densely populated state (after Bihar, WB, and Kerala) right? If UP failed in population control, Kerala and WB failed miserably. Why is there no backlash against them? I don't understand what you're saying. How's voting someone into office being equated to mobocracy? You can ensure minority rights are upheld even if the majority chooses a leader of the country. Also, why are the choices of majority and minority mandatorily different in your sad scenario? Can't they both vote in a single person. Exactly my point, thanks for saying this. Punjabi here and please don't clump us, as well as J&K, Uttarakhand, Haryana etc. with the BIMARU states (who will be getting the most power now). We implemented population control too, just like the south did and will suffer as much as y'all in the South will from this half-assed law. People in these states are as well off as the ones in the south (similar HDI and stuff). My point being, how convenient is it for the government to siphon off tax money from the South and the real, geographical North and pour it into the BIMARU states who did jackshit to control their population and are now being rewarded with the most power in the largest democracy on the planet. All of us pay for their ignorance. This wouldn't even result in equitable elections now. Every party looking to win will only need to appease states like UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, MP, etc. now while completely ignoring the PB, HP, HR, UK and J&K and the South. Talk about a monumental fuck up. The solution: just don't change the representation, leave it as it is. (Also as the other guy said, Bihar isn't even the north so stop clumping all of us together and blaming as well for those states' ignorance) Is this way to reward states who adhered to strict population control and brought TFR below 2.1? I hope some balance should be there between states who did well to control population vs those who didn't. > There are no 'political conflicts This is literally a political conflict. > this is just something most parties agree on Yes, on account of political expediency. > Political statements from Chief Ministers usually lead to policy In India? > Exactly, the same economic wealth that the North Indian states suck out and spend building temples and statues. You realise this isn't remotely true in the context of states like Bihar? > How bad of South India not to want the benefit of being robbed by the Northern states The South has been one of the main beneficiaries of the stripping of Eastern India's minerals - not sure robbed is the word you want to use in this context really. > the absolute delight of being trampled by linguistic Hindi hegemony Something that would adversely affect states like Bihar as well, and are being protested against? You realise the South isn't unique in protesting against Hindi hegemony right? Given India's diversity, we need equal seats in Rajya Sabha for each state, like the US. Using chatgpt makes everything in your argument invalid now. As per my understanding, there are basically 2 sane views on this - 1) In any democracy, each person should have one vote and get equal representation. However, this will drastically reduce the power Southern States have in National politics, that too for being good at population control through sensible governance. 2) Emulate a US style system. However, this will lead to disproportionate per capita representation. Also, smaller states like Assam cannot send the same number of MPs as a large af state like UP. (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong here on emulating the US system) Hence, I think both the views suck in different ways with some or the other state getting F‚Äôed in the A. IMO a country with 330 million people (US) has 50 states while we Indians are 1500 million with 28 states only, which doesn‚Äôt make sense. I think we should break the states into smaller parts, especially the bigger ones like UP and Maharashtra. This will ensure that a single CM won‚Äôt be Kingmaker (looking at Yogi here) while also making it easier to govern. Would love to hear your views on this.. >Giving voters an equal amount of representatives is not a reward. It is. Back in 1976 we gave each voter equal number of representatives. We also wanted to reduce population growth. Many states did it and some didnt. And states which failed now should be given more power? Sorry No. Espcially when those states still havent beem able to control population. India is union of states. States power shouldnt be curtailed for doing what we as a country planned to do. > UP & others didn't. UP is the 4th most densely populated state after WB and Kerala. I don't get why you'll criticize UP for not implementing population control effectively while giving Kerala and WB a free pass. > And states which failed now should be given more power? States are not being given more power, people are being given a proportionate number of representatives. Some Indians are not more valuable than others. > Espcially when those states still havent beem able to control population. UP's TFR is 2.4, in 1981 it was 5.8. Kerala's TFR is 1.8, in 1981 it was 2.4 - which reduction seems more impressive to you/demonstrates the amount of effort put in? > States power shouldnt be curtailed for doing what we as a country planned to do Representative democracy shouldn't be diminished because richer states want to be more proportionately represented than poorer ones. >The point here is that the southern states actually did what the government asked the states to do; reducing the population. >UP & others didn't You should really get some education before you spout half-truths ! All states have had a reduction in fertility. If mapped to HDI and per capita income the trends mirror that of South. \"South\" is not exceptional. Your claim that UP and Bihar didn't do anything is so factually incorrect. That's backward. So the people who are already doing economically well get even more representation and people who probably need more representation get even less representation. So rich people get more value for their vote than poor. What kind of democracy is that? They will have to do it. South cannot revolt. Democracy is one man, one vote. Are you per chance living somewhere other than India? Irrelevant >Tyranny of the majority Lol. Representation is tyranny? You should cry more. >please be okay with the fact that politicians in the South will push They should do what's best for their states. If TFR is falling really low, govt should work to increase it. Nothing wrong with that. This proves the horseshoe theory. Both left and right will undermine democracy the moment it feels unconvinient. Poor and uneducated people have high furtility rate. South had headstart in industrialization and thus controlled the population. Nothing magic there Everyone born in India must have equal say in government for democracy to work So my vote should matter more if I pay greater income tax? I'm not from either UP or Bihar but 1 man is 1 vote unless you want a south run dictatorship He is .... In his own dreamland Very relevant. Reading your comments, it would seem you most likely don‚Äôt live in india or at the very least aren‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs happening here over the last decade. You're counting state as a single unit. What you should do is count every citizen as a single unit. Otherwise value of the vote of a single person would vary depending on where he live. Every citizen (not every state) of india should get equal say in the voting. Goa is culturally, linguistically, and ethnically closer to the north Aryan states then it is to south Dravidian ones. That, or is an NRI. Because more poor people are there you moron. And India is progressive in wealth distribution (somewhat) so naturally welfare money will flow there from rich states. What is your next argument? Mumbai stop paying tax for rest of MH? BLR stop paying tax for rest of KA? Rich stop paying tax used for poor welfare? Yes, or the person lives in a very small bubble. Or I don't loathe myself in thewire? I don't hate adani Ambani either. Moral of the story is breed more to get more representation and eat gutkha Aaye hai NRI ji gyan chodne üôè Value of the vote of citizens isn't dependent on the amount of tax he pays. Value of every vote should be equal, not dependent on tax or anything else. If we do it proportional to the tax than richer states would get more say and poor states would get less say. What we need for poor stats to get better is more representation from there not less. And my analogy is perfect. Value of someone's vote shouldn't depend on how developed their state is. Dumb argument. India is proportional democracy. People vote not states. while carrying 7 to 8 lack imported weapon as a means for self defence, having kids and let them roam like a wild animal eventually ending in to protector of religion. Well okay, let me tell you why this is wrong. Democracy means that every individual and their voice matters. Now India ain't Germany or France with 11-15Cr people, but we have 1.4B people, which is 140Cr if you are having trouble understanding the number of people. Now Southern States, total has 35Cr+ people and you are saying that 50Cr+ people in the north should elect a central govt, even if 35Cr+ people don't want them?? It's not about majority or minority, in a democracy, 10Cr people or 100Cr people doesn't matter, they both should have a say in the govt. Now what bad can happen you say: Hypothetically say Yogi ji says we will force Hindi on Southern States, and he can force it too because he is not \"Answerable\" to southern states. Like Central Govt gave 13Cr to Southern Railways and 123Cr to Northern railways. South is not respected as of now, and if they became irrelevant in the national scenario, it will be worse. Whatever you are saying, you don't have a clear picture of a democracy... And humans, with our 1000 year old history, can say that the majority always trouble the minority, be it religion, caste or class :))) Edit: Before you reply that the majority will not trouble the minority, let me give an example of Japan, where religion or class doesn't matter, most of them are Buddhist/Christians and do a normal job, I mean all of them are just Japanese. Then too the central govt is unfair to Upper regions of Japan because \"their dialect\" is different. Like there, they stretch their last syllable, and only for that, there is a disparity and political tensions. We humans are trash and love to divide ourselves, and that's the end line. Dude Punjab & Haryana's population density is higher than the so-called BIMARU states of MP and Rajasthan. Your state has a low population because of less area doesn't mean you were more effective than the so-called BIMARU states in population control lol. Likewise UP has a lesser population density than Kerala and WB. But according to you guys UP, MP & Rajasthan failed in population control and Kerala, WB, and Punjab are the highest achievers in population control. At least talk some sense? I mean, no one I know hates Ambani, Adani, yeah a few, but hate is a strong word to associate how one feels about industrialists one won‚Äôt meet. But, please do explain how anyone can loathe themselves in the wire? accha sila diya mere population control and at par life indicators ka. Gobi hai to pumpkin hai. we dont need UP and Bihar Just because you don't like Yogi doesn't mean we should abondon the democratic principle Presumption - even if 35Cr+ people don't want them?? W.r.t. your delusion on \" It's not about majority or minority, in a democracy, 10Cr people or 100Cr people doesn't matter, they both should have a say in the govt. \" If 50 cr people from the north are able to elect a leader while 30 cr from the south aren't - that exactly means that every individual vote count was valued a 1. What you want is the opposite. You want the 30 cr from the south should have a greater say in elections that 50 cr from the north. Also, why is India fragmented in your head. For me - it's not north v south. It's 50 cr Indians making a choice and 30 cr Indians making another choice. W.r.t. your random dreams of hindi imposition- the constitution has a basic structure that cannot be changed. Stop dreading. W.r.t. your questions on policy decisions - I don't thing you're bright enough for economics. Kerala have one of the lowest score in population growth rate. The density will remain same if a couple have two kids,and kerala have below two on average now. Reducing density won't be as easy as reducing population growth rate. i am not saying we should do, but there needs to be a bigger debate about the structure of how this delimitation happens. Because lets say we simply go with this proposed number of seats than this will just lead to even bigger divide between north and south, and will also effectively promote the stance that controlling the population is not good if you want to run a big political party. I was just trying to make a point and say that UP and Bihar doing worse economically. They should focus more on their population and economy rather than religious fanaticism. They are already getting most of the taxes from the south and more seats for them will mean that central government can completely ignore the southern states and still win the election. Rajya Sabha needs more power over money bills and vote of no confidence. Maybe give equal power to all states in Rajya Sabha. Otherwise it is time for south India to stop the bank rolling of the BIMARU states. You can't have your cake and eat it too. bro you're so naive Doesn't matter. One person, one vote rule is supreme. Do you want to make UP/Bihar people vote count 3/5 of MH/KA people? Your racism is showing > north Aryan states then it is to south Dravidian ones. Haahahahahahahaha. You don't know what you are talking about. While I agree with you on the same value for one vote, you are being very black and white and there is definitely nuance involved here. While in theory one vote has same value, because of the state population, people in those 3 states will have more value because of our systems. Largely the main reason for the population difference is population growth. This is not a result of migration. India wanted to reduce its population. Just because some states did well, they will end up losing their power which is not something you should incentivise. Imo population growth should be part of the equation for how the no of seats are calculated. More and more centre is stripping the power of states. If states have a lot more autonomy, maybe they will carry on and do what works for them but that wouldn‚Äôt be the case. If you are not resolving the issues, you end up making 3 states have the most power over the other states which is definitely not equality. Yes And I am saying getting more representatives will help them get better economically and socially. That's why we need more representation from these states. And I agree that Religious fanaticism is a problem but that doesn't mean we should be taking away their voting rights. *punda So what alternative you propose? Will it preserve proportional representation? Any system which give equal vote to each person (regardless of state, weatlh, religion etc..) then it is bound to happen that post populated state get more representation. That is fair Both BJP and Congress extremists love undermining democracy and representation when it benefits them. To hell with your BS idea. People in south India should protest about this. This shouldn't happen at any cost You should start a.course.about what aboutism... You can have a nice future... As an educated person and citizen of the country youself, I think you will agree that if 28 states in india start growing their population at the same rate as UP, Bihar than India will never get developed. So while in theory it does sound good to make it proportional but in practical terms it will not be beneficial for the future of country. Because if we are doing this, than we are effectively telling all 28 states to increase their population if they want bigger seat at the table, and I am sure you would agree than we do not want to increase the rate of our population They deferred it before. And ofcourse the south can revolt. Why shouldn't they? They can't sit by and become politically insignificant So my and my country's fate will be decided by people who can be easily brainwashed, grown least compared to other states and corrupt af. Nah, I'm good. Worst idea to give them this super power. Already UP gets 333rs,/100 rs they pay in taxes and Maharashtra gets 8.9rs / 100 rs we pay in direct taxes from centre UP needs to be split spoken like a true sanghi Rather than this extreme suggestion, taxes should be divided between state and center, just like USA. Centre should have less proportion of it though unlike Canada. This gives state more autonomy over their economics and indirectly to the population who voted the governing government. Center can piss poor for all they want, as they won't implicate states and their population much. Wait, I'm dumb, or you just don't wanna accept it? Since 2003, BJP's vote has just increased in Northern States, till Maharashtra. As of now, none of the Southern States have the BJP ruling government. As of now, even 6-7% of people in Maharashtra don't vote for the BJP, they can easily lose the majority, and not get 270+ seats. It doesn't matter what you think, what I'm saying has been happening for the past 75 years with Congress, and now BJP. Even Congress lost 2014 elections because the Southern States voted for BJP/Non Congress parties. Southern States are king makers, or at least a lot relevant. BJP's (NDA) vote share in the 2019 election was 45%, Congress (UPA) was 29%, now BJP got 330+ seats and Congress got 98 seats. BJP got almost all of the Northern States from Rajasthan to Bihar. That's a fair enough game and you are right, but as of now, say Maharashtra and Karnataka voted Congress/Others, Bengal voted TMC, all this will lead to NDA losing 90+ seats and the PM Post. From 330, it will be 240, and from 98, it will be 188. The point is not who's winning, but with the number game. Now with the new system, say 440 seats are required to win the elections, following 2023 trend, UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh will vote BJP, and say Karnataka, Orissa and the group votes congress or state parties, which they will mostly do and did in 2019 (apart from Karnataka), BJP will have 420 seats without even a SINGLE seat from the south, not even single seat from Maharashtra or West Bengal, that's what is scary. Representation is important, BJP can just listen to Spotify when a Southern State speaks or Protests. And about Hindi imposition and constitution, well, constitution says that if there is a case against a MLA/MP, he/she has to give up his parliament seat, especially if it's a special case like terrorism or POSCO Act, now Brij Bhushan, Wrestler protest guy, has a case of POSCO against him, and last time I checked, he was outside new parliament, as a MP. Another constitution thing: Use of religious symbols while election is illegal, and such MP would be banned, and last time I checked Owaisi was telling Muslims to vote because they are Muslims, and a MLA in Karnataka was asking to vote him if the voter was a Brahman. Nothing has happened to them. According to the constitution, Money Laundering was banned, but BJP introduced electoral bonds, which allows business man to give money to political parties without any screening, in short, it's money laundering with extra steps, with the bill, even a Pakistani Company can make a fake account in India and pay Owaisi or whoever they want to pay. The Constitution has been changed, and can be changed against the minority. Happened in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Singapore, South Africa, Israel, USA (abortion thingy in Texas). You really don't understand democracy or our constitution if you are saying: \"W.r.t. your random dreams of hindi imposition- the constitution has a basic structure that cannot be changed. Stop dreading. \" Language is still not a \"Fundamental Right\" in our constitution, so legally Hindi Imposition is not impossible. BJP even drafted a bill, but was taken back after RSS leaders from Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu reacted to it. SO YES, HINDI IMPOSITION IS POSSIBLE LEGALLY. And you didn't react to 13Cr and 123Cr Railway budget stuff, are you retarded or something? Or are you the one whose social media accounts have been hijacked by the IT Cell Department?? Well, go watch Mr Beat to know about Misinformation, and democracy. He is not an Indian, hence neutral, so maybe he will help you out of the shithole. No need to reply, I'm blocking human bots like you. Vote for BJP next election else your mental health can affect you badly... Kudos. All who vote to draw a line along BIMARU - Raj, MP, UP and Bihar. All south of it can live happily and are all connected - including the north east. Sorry, Punjab, HR, UK and rest... We need to build a biiig bridge across somehow. 324 off 543 to 4 BIMARU states is almost 60%. How about we do seat rebaselining based on GDP contribution instead... Is that too capitalistic..? Maybe linguistically, but culturally and ethnically, no. Also depends on which part of Goa you're talking about, South Goa has quite a bit of influence from coastal Karnataka and North Goa is influenced by coastal Maharashtra. They have a huge Marathi influence which I consider more North than South. Maybe the South influenced them a bit since they are on the border but overall you can't say they are very similiar to the other Southern states As much as I hate to say it this is still an equitable form of representation. You ruin the quality of representation if you don‚Äôt dristribute equitably. The only realistic solution is an actually equally powerful upper house (Rajya Sabha) with equal representation. Again full word salad and no alternative. What do **you** want to do instead? If centre impose NE on ground of AR in manipur + extend 5yr period thrice of UG +conduct census in 2026+appointed DC in 2027 than BJP can easily win center again Amit Shah is gaming the republic to create a gutter version of the 100 year Reich. Hai shri ram! Separate taxes between center and state. That \"word salad\" was to dumb down the argument on a layman basis to make you understand the gravity of the situation, but it does not seem like you are interested in appreciating and accepting that your opinion is wrong. Also, like i said before it is a complex issue which needs to be debated amongst the experts of topic, so you and i sitting here cant come up with a solution without going into its depth first. The gov needs to setup a council which has experts from both north and south, to come up with a new solution Make Rajya Sabha stronger to maintain regional representation. My suggestion is to reallocate RS seats in proportion of the land area of each state. No. Resorting to name calling is what children & liberals end up doing. If you have anything of substance to add regarding the topic, please go ahead States with smaller population should get extra number of seats to make fair allocation.Quantity is not quality . Sheer numbers must not be the only criteria to get seats . How about taking into account literacy levels too.Higher literacy states should get more seats .We cannot afford to let our country get sidelined because of mob rule by ill educated buffoons . This is exactly where an anti-democratic body like the equivalent of the US senate would help. The us system sort of 2orls because during the election you vote for a president, which allows the electoral college to vote appropriately. How would that work in india where the PM is decided based on which party gets the most votes \\ Moreover in tey US if the majority in one state vote for one party, all votes go to that party afaik. How's that fair? Bhai exam mein 40% se pass ho skte Hain iska mtlb kewal 40% padhoge Aisa thodi hai Ohh the irony in your statement ...... > Largely the main reason for the population difference is population growth Every state has significantly reduced their population. Some states inevitably take more time than others, because the starting points are different, and poverty and population are deeply linked with each other (i.e. poorer places have larger TFRs). Penalising people for being poor isn't something I'll ever support. > More and more centre is stripping the power of states. Which is a different issue, worth protesting against. I'm not willing to conflate the division of powers between the centre and states with advocating for the effective disenfranchisement of people because they come from poorer states with larger populations. The two are different issues. It's not whataboutism, it's pointing out the hypocrisies and flaws in someone's argument, given that the argument is based on 'fairness'. Last i checked, Democracy was equal representation for all , not two states deciding who rules the nation .... No one is trying to devalue anything buddy , but the fact is two states who failed to control population are going to decide who rules the nation .... Two states out of more than two dozen .......which is quite literally the closest we are getting to a dictatorship....while your argument that south wants dictatorship because they want equal representation is quite literally moronic ..... Wanting an equal say is not dictatorship genius.....idiots like you who are supporting this uneven representation are the one's promoting dictatorship, not the ones asking for equal representation I agree with you. But in that case in future like in 50 years. A single city can be a state. The singular most sensible wall of text on this thread. Thank You. Lot of people here are about to amend the constitution - guys this current flavor of Democracy is not working out - guys why don't we have a system like America, makes so much sense. Let's curb the powers of Lok Sabha, we'll give more power to the Rajya Sabha like the Senate in America. Makes me wonder about the reality they inhabit. I‚Äôm deeply troubled that a fair and balanced comment like yours and the previous commenter got downvoted. Us south indians can't catch a break. Fuck you all. That 'word salad' argument is so dumb, its ridiculous. I have seen people use it when they have nothing to respond to a well put out argument but still wanna have the last word. Absolutely idiotic. Naah, I don't see a word salad. I see a pretty compelling argument to which you have no response to so you are trying to claim their argument is nonsense so you won't have to respond to it. We have 2 parliament buildings now, let the north keep the new one, the south (north-east as well if they like) can have the old one and we'll govern ourselves with our own Lok and Rajaya Sabha. /s So‚Ä¶. Reservations basically? Ah yes, coz history totally doesn't have multiple instances of totalitarian regimes voted in by radicalised majority that ended up persecuting the minority with a fury. >You can ensure minority rights are upheld even if the majority chooses a leader of the country. Like the Nazis did with jews ? Or how Idi Amin did with Indians ? or How the turks did with the Armenians ? >why are the choices of majority and minority mandatorily different in your sad scenario? Can't they both vote in a single person. Ughmm No, Because if they all voted for the same guy there wouldn't be a minority or a majority and if you are referring to the current scenario where North is the majority and south is the minority and you believe there will come a day (the way things stand) where north and South will vote for the same party then... Man, do I admire your optimism. Dude, I was agreeing with you. Read the comment again. Better yet, read my response to the same comment you were replying to. Southern states aren't being made insignificant - they're economically successful, are doing better on most HDI indices, Bangalore and Hyderabad are the two focal points of India's IT revolution and Chennai's one of the four metros. The South + Bengal + Maharashtra + Delhi + Punjab + Rajasthan + Odisha + Chhattisgarh all going the way of non-BJP parties would immediately make the BJP lose. Excluding Maharashtra, these are all states that are not ruled by the BJP - and BJP is only in power in Maharashtra due to shenanigans that don't work in the context of central elections. The above also excludes Bihar, which is currently governed by the opposition and if the coalition stands, would not return a BJP majority in a general election. Now obviously, the opposition won't win every seat in the above states, but the same principle also goes for the BJP in other states. Defeating the BJP is pretty important, but not at the cost of the fundamental democratic basis of this country. No? Whilst I support reservations in the context of education/jobs with respect to caste and other inequalities, MPs across constituencies being elected via a similar of amount of people who are eligible to vote is the opposite of reservations. People out here are really commenting as if UP-Bihar did absolutely nothing for population control for the past 40-50 years. A quick look at state-wise fertility rates on Wikipedia will tell you the following: (1981->2021) UP: 5.8->2.4 Bihar: 5.7->3.0 Kerala: 2.4->1.8 Andhra Pradesh: 3.8->1.7 Karnataka: 3.6->1.7 Tamil Nadu: 3.4->1.8 India: 4.5->2.0 [(Source)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_union_territories_of_India_by_fertility_rate#cite_note-survey-2) I know that a potential Lok Sabha seat distribution would reduce the power of southern states in the Lok Sabha, but people's hatred for the northern states is clear on display in this post's comment section. Also, it is the perfect time for seat redistribution as India's fertility rate is at replacement level. Edit: Grammar Well if you do not go by popular vote you get ruled by minority like in USA. A state with just 1 million population have two senate seats and a state with 35 million also has the same. Its horrible. &#x200B; But if you go by popular vote as in India BIMARU states just keep making babies with not much to add to economy and they end up influencing what govt is formed in the center and the southern states who have the best economic output and have a highly educated population but chose to be responsible with increasing population are getting punished. &#x200B; I think we need a Hybrid in both locations. Each state number of MPs should be capped at some point. Economic output should also be taken into the formula along with population and physical area(non desert) to figure out how many MP seats a state gets. forget south India man up+Bihar will have half of seats of other 18 states and UTs' seats Modi mocked the constitution in the last 9 years without needing that 2/3rd majority. The only possible solution is to cut the Central govt powers vis-a-vis states. Central govt should not get 50% gst. The thing is, The US people also complain their system with the same types of problems. There, the bible belt, the redneck and deeply conservative states who have pretty small populations fuck over the big boys like New York, California etc who have far bigger populations and also make the most money which the red states take away happily while pushing their Theocratic christian laws like abortion ban onto the more developed blue states. Maybe have a US like system in Rajyasabha. All states get equal representation there. So neither the majority nor the minority can fuck the other over. Democracy is an institution for the people, it is in the south's best interests to revolt to avoid being fucked over by majoritarian rule. Bhai rishtedar ka beta ya class ka koi aur baccha hamse zada la skta hai Isley pdhte hai . Agar koi 40 se zada na laye to Mai bhi 40 mai khush rhunga. The Delimitation should happen on the basis of tax payers instead of the rabble who vote for biriyani & booze & freebies. At least this way taxpayers will have some say in the government and the policies. >You don‚Äôt get brownie points for controlling population or implementing right policies, no one told you to do so. Dude, Are you joking ? Population control was literally the national policy. So yeah, They were in fact told to control their population (like all the states were). They listened and did it it because it was the right thing to do. Now they are being punished for it since the way this is going, South is gonna be deemed irrelevant in terms od national policy since Any party could just focus on 3-5 states and win the central elections easily. That's bad. >Also, south is nothing special, there is north east, west we have gujrat, goa and maharashtra, we have small states at the top. You don‚Äôt see these states getting insecure. Yes because those states aren't as culturally, linguistically and ideologically different than UP (for example) as the southern states are. The population based model might work for a culturally homogenous countries like those in Eastern Europe or Africa but for a country like ours, it creates this major problem. US is a horrible system which leads to a two party system with no other options, as is clearly seen in the US today. Germany has a much better system. They aren't simply increasing the seats. They are disproportionately increasing the seats based on population growth. Southern states will have absolutely no say in the national policy if a party wins by a big margin in 4-5 states with biggest population (Which BJP would likely do in the current scenario). That is classic 'tyranny of the majority'. >Representation is tyranny No it isn't and the OC didn't say that too. Google 'Tyranny of Majority' of you don't understand what it is. >If TFR is falling really low, govt should work to increase it. Nothing wrong with that. Dude, You seriously think india needs to fucking increase the population ? No state is getting 'low tfr'. Southern states have enough rate to maintain their population. states like Bihar and UP are quite literally breeding like rabbits. What about it? > Southern states aren't being made insignificant - they're economically successful, are doing better on most HDI indices, Bangalore and Hyderabad are the two focal points of India's IT revolution and Chennai's one of the four metros. Politically they are. BJP doesn't have to make inroads anymore. And not having a say in electing a union government would be brutal. Your maths might be sound but electorally it is less likely than BJP winning UP+ large chunks of Bihar + MP + Maharastra + a large chunk of Bengal + Rajasthan+ Gujarat + seats from other regions These are all reflective of the political standings of today. This isn't even including Karnataka. Which is dicey but will in the long run stay out of the sangh control. But still have pockets of bjp support So the likes of TN, the Andhra states and Kerala will be all become insignificant. That is not a fundamental democratic basis of this country. And think about things like language imposition. The northern states will easily have the numbers to pass any law to make Hindi the national language. That is one such example ‚ÄúEqual representation for all‚Äù Except, this is not what you are advocating for at all. You‚Äôre asking for unequal representation, not based on population You were cool with the same system for the last 50 years, so what changed all of a sudden? They are if you count Pakistan developed Rest of the states aren‚Äôt close to central states in any form language or ideology. unfortunately population is a reality and we have been kicking the decision for many decades. Yes, parties might just focus on few states and will every time, highly likely Yogi will be Pm. Just give Rajyasabha the US style representation. That would put a safety net on this at least. > but electorally it is less likely Yes, for now. Politics aren't constant though, and the idea of disenfranchising people because of political gain isn't one that I'm ever going to support. Mass protests to strengthen federalism? Absolutely. Mass protests to enforce disenfranchisement? No. > The northern states will easily have the numbers to pass any law to make Hindi the national language. How? UP + Bihar (though they wouldn't vote for this as a whole) + MP + Rajasthan + Chhattisgarh + Delhi wouldn't create a majority for this. Gujarati politicians wouldn't vote for this, it'd be political suicide. Ditto Maharashtra, Punjab, Bengal, Assam, Odisha etc. The vast majority of politicians from Northern, Western, Eastern, North Eastern and Southern states would by necessity have to vote against this because they'd be punished by the electorate. So they wanna lose all southern support, governments already don't give a fuck about ne, ngl this is gonna backfire like hell in the long run We'd have a masterstroke with up and bihar getting decided in 20 parts I didn't say they are close. I said they are not as vastly different as the southern states are. Important difference. The problem is that History has proven time and again that when two ideologically incompatible factions exist (cue North and South India) and the majority is given unchecked power, the minority gets oppressed horribly. Which either leads to a genocide or a civil war if nothing is done to fix the problem. Haryana too balanced out lot of its flaws What is equal visibility? Are you sure you want Tripura to have the same seats in the house as UP? Are you sure that every time a group of people need to get more seats allotted to them, all they need to do is split their state into 5 and boom 5X more seats? Have you ever complained about the people of Nagaland having 48X less influence compared to the people of Maharashtra? Is your concern about heavier population growth of UP and Bihar? So you want to give their folks lesser voting rights compared to a south Indian? Would you then also like to make each Muslim vote only 70% as important as each Hindu vote given their higher population growth? Each person in the nation should have one vote and the vote should have equal value for all \\- any argument beyond that is either a reflection of your political leanings or a desire for your specific region to have a special status in the country. Fuck this shit really. I'm in Noida, but no way should UP and Bihar get more representation. Fucking shitholes of India. Braindead political class from underdeveloped, lawless areas cannot run the country, when they cannot effectively rule their own states properly. Again, you cannot club whole north India together, there indeed are few Hindi speaking states which you call north and they will get advantage in this process. It‚Äôs a reality, given current political situation in India, it‚Äôs more than likely that Hindi speaking states will get this super sized representation and south won‚Äôt. That's how it's been in the US - they campaign in just a few states, the ones that can possibly flip to one of Republicans or Democrats. Let me tell you UP Bihars fertility rate was 6.6 and southern states were below 4 when family planning started. So it's really better this way. Population numbers were always gonna be skewed in favour of North family planning or not. r/gerrymandering Looks like you highlighted UPs issue and why it became orange state to solve them. Completely agree with you. The US system is so flawed that billionaires just jerrymander few districts and that gets them majority power. Then they vote against the interest of people in favour of billionaires. Easy to brainwash fewer people too. >Most people here would take umbrage at the suggestion that Indians are inherently less valuable than Australians because there are more of us than there are Australians - yet are somehow comfortable making that argument internally. It's pretty pathetic. What bull is this? People who are uneducated being given more power to vote and impose illiteracy on the educated is also not how democracy works. India is federal and each state must have its fair share of representation at the center. It should be equal voting power based on state not on individuals. The individuals have their voting rights to elect their local representative who fights for them at the state level for their voice to be represented at the national level. You do not give one state all voting power if they have most of the population. What incentivises them to educate their folk and give them better conditions which is known to lower population if they can use this illiterate population to rise to power? According to you should people remain uneducated and poor by the powers that be so that they all get the great privilege to vote with empty stomachs? The south is doing well because of education. IF UP as you say gets \"equal\" vote share then the periodic table and evolution will not be the only things not taught, more will be removed and the economic advantage will go away and the south will become like UP instead of the other way around. Your logic is flawed. Hn to opposing party na le aye passing marks isi liye try krenge na zyada jagah Yes everyone must have an equal say in their local government. The local politicians then fight for the peoples rights at the sate level and then the state has certain representatives to fight at the national level. We do not vote for our PM after all. Perhaps it's indeed time to end this farce of the Thekkan states staying with Hindustan and go back to being independent. India‚Äôs population growth rate has been declining and the population is expected to peak at around 1700 million I know all of this. What is your point? > People who are uneducated being given more power to vote If you have an issue with universal adult franchise, I don't have anything to add to this conversation. > India is federal and each state must have its fair share of representation at the center. It should be equal voting power based on state not on individuals For the benefit of other readers, and not the person I'm replying to - this is not how the Indian structure has ever worked. We are constitutionally bound for the Lok Sabha to represent the population - India is not a federation of states, it's a union that is quasi-federal. > What incentivises them to educate their folk and give them better conditions which is known to lower population if they can use this illiterate population to rise to power? Again, for the benefit of readers who are not OP, states like UP and Bihar have consistently voted in various parties, and have seen tremendous increases in things like literacy, healthcare etc. To blame the current rise in polarisation on the poor, instead of the exceptionally rich and educated, is ludicrous. These are arguments that supporters of colonisation made on independence - that our people were too poor, too illiterate to vote. It was bullshit then, it's bullshit now. The south is doing well because of historical advantages. Kerala's literacy rate was close to 50% on independence, Bihar's was 13.5. The South isn't innately superior, it's just not been ravaged as much. Expecting the two to have equal levels of development is absurd and ignores reality and history. Dhruv rathee made a video couple of years back ig. He said the exact same thing that it will reduce south state‚Äôs importance altogether because of population. I am looking at the present. The present has the north removing basic facts from education. We do not want that infiltrating the south. They should push for this nonsense and maybe the south will begin a push for independence. Central will then start moving things from State list to Concurrent List > The present has the north removing basic facts from education. The NCERT's a central institution, not a 'northern' one. > maybe the south will begin a push for independence Okay, try that? Let's not pretend like southern states don't benefit from being part of the union. If you want the benefits of the union, but want to pretend like Indians from poorer states aren't part of your country, that's a you problem. >Each constituency should generally have the same number of voters - that's one of the ***fundamental*** premises of a functional democracy (otherwise, some people are more represented than others). Provide source of this assumption being a ***fundamental*** of a democracy. I'll then believe its not a toolkit buzzword going around right now by rwing. If anything creating checks and balances are what make a Democracy ***functional***. Why do we have 1/5th of world population and not have a big say in UN? How much does EU make their smaller members insignificant? France, Germany, Italy, Spain do not eclipse the other member states. Universal Suffrage itself has been a recent thing and needs tweaks. This so called 1 person 1 vote may work in homogeneous countries but not elsewhere. There's the tackling of **tyranny of the majority** too which is why serf majority constituencies have special consideration somewhat similar to communal electorates. All that are for naught if Centre can create constituencies frequently and set gerrymandered borders from the very beginning to make the minorities have no stronghold anywhere. Gujju-Maru-Sindhis have been selling their \"fellow\" South Asians into the global slave trade throughout history, many of the adanis, the ambanis, the iranis, the agrawals, the patels, the wadias, the modis, the Mallyas, the Reddys don't give a shit about you or regard you as equal Indians. The ganges belt is a useful middleman scapegoat because they will do and say anything the northwestern merchants pays them to say. I have nothing common with any \"Indians\" from other states besides my religion. Why would I not consider myself a Bengali first and then Indian (like EU) if the above conditions persist? India is once-abstract now recent umbrella but its no use if it is going to be imperialistic. >otherwise, some people are more represented than others So now some ethno-linguistic states will be more represented than others. Good job. People representation should only be on the low level constituencies, not on the federal level. I agree. Although UP might have higher seats it's not gonna be same over years and decades to come. We have to think of India as a single country than union of states. If they have more representation they'll make better conditions to improve the education, which they are in need of. Being a good leader doesn't relate to education and they'll obviously have highly educated people under them who advise and help all the time. So now you want to give Delhi control of partitioning people like British did to Punjab and Bengal. Literally Congress partitioned AP-TS. there were some local regionalists who wanted the partition much like HM and ML were for Punjab and Bengal but they were not majority. I remember Parliament and Vidhan Sabha being active overnight during the AP-TS partition due to no majority concensus and a lot of unparliamentary activities took place so that Northie Congress could secure that partition for the then upcoming elections. Similar unparliamentary story happened with No-confidence motion around Indo-US nuclear deal with our merchants paying out several parties and party members to backstab and ignore what other ***representatives*** wanted but thats another story. As long as Delhi gets to be some sort of an obnoxious power centre for Eastern and Southern states, such issues will keep on happening. Opposition headed by North India has no tangible value other than routing the incumbent North Indian ruling party. Make Rahul or Nitish PM and they will still impose gareebi-Urdu in East and South like Pakistan did to Bangladesh, they'll still demand more tax from South and flush into the northern sinkhole. West Bengal doesn't even produce much capital anymore and yet does not get Central expenditures either. Forget development, Mamata had to run around to get the state's share of tax from Centre to pay pensioners. Its a real shame the incumbent party has become so powerful that within the Opposition the sentiment has become \"If not INC/Rahul then who?\" Terrible state of duopolistic democracy today that I can not reject BJP and INC equally. Modi to bas jhaki hai, Yogi abhi baki hai. Circa 2026 We should have the US system. Every state, 2 sears for rajya Sabha atleast. Pretty sure South is instead pissed that while the tax has been rightfully taken more from them but wrongfully wasted on sinkholes time and time again with no change in development. Ideally the North should have gotten developed by now such that Central expenditure could allocate for all states equally. And FYI North had the best Industries on mechanical engineering post partition which all got ruined as their own northwestern merchants started dropshipping items from China to make a quick buck. Our products would used to get exported even and enjoy good reception. Texas is not a small state. It has more seats than NY. Even Florida has same seats as NY. Plus the abortion ban doesn't affect blue states since they are free to form their own policy as liberally as they want. The red states don't have to comply to federal mandate anymore. In fact the people of red state will have to travel to blue states if they want abortion at a later time during pregnancy. Pretty sure South is instead pissed that while the tax has been rightfully taken more from them but wrongfully wasted on sinkholes time and time again with no change in development. Ideally the North should have gotten developed by now such that Central expenditure could allocate for all states equally. And FYI North had the best Industries on mechanical engineering post partition which all got ruined as their own northwestern merchants started dropshipping items from China to make a quick buck. Our products would used to get exported even and enjoy good reception. Bro you're just saying the same stuff again and again. Just give an alternative, if you do have it. i didnt check the username, i thought you were that same person Hope so if Delhi continues to push its will on East and South like Pak did on Bangladesh. Northie bhajpa and northie congress are all same when it comes to such matters. Redditors are too young to experience all the Delhi imperialist stuff been going on for decades. I personally see myself my state first now than this umbrella called India which is just North India roleplaying British Raj. The only commonality I have with other states is religion and color. I might have identified as Indian if things were becoming equal and would have supported 1 person 1 vote and even a newer non federal Constitution in Democracy if ethno-linguistic federalism lost relevance. Instead we are moving towards a non-federal Hindu(northie) Constitution in the upcoming decades if people stay silent. Our states have already been reorganised by ethnolinguistic lines post independence, moving to a EU loose union instead would be a more just solution. Both your solutions favour Delhi, or at best slows the inevitable Delhi imperialism South can be treated as a bloc hence the focus. Delhi has already sown discord between Maithlis, Odia, Bengalis, Assamese, while Bangladesh is sovereign. The east can't be considered a bloc. > bihar is not even a north indian state You're gonna trigger people who have simped for Delhi since independence. Mithlanchal areas can be considered East but not entire Bihar. Same with Jharkhand. Dhanbad and Ranchi are North Indian, Jamshedpur is inbetween. Doubt its a BJP centric thing to dislike. If Nitish or Rahul was PM they would still impose gareebi-Urdu on South and East, like Pakistan imposed Urdu on Bangladesh. The delimitation was *frozen* for 50years, it might have been worse although would have been improving if delimitation wasn't frozen. However as you put India: 4.5->2.0: Unless you can list out what exact control these two states it does not show causation. A major chunk of causation for the pan-India decline has to do with more income inequality, more work hours, less famines, and women empowerment. Countries in Africa are not really homogeneous. Abortions are for the well off now in red states. The average person doesn‚Äôt even have 400$ in case of an emergency. A majority of times it‚Äôs the poor who get pregnant As someone born in Delhi and brought up in UP, I can only speak from my experience, I clearly remember 2 prominent govt programmes: 1. Hum 2 Hamare 2 - Loosely translated to a husband and wife should only have 2 kids 2. 1-3-2 - There should be a gap of minimum 3 years between the birth of 2 children. Now, I think these were Central Government Programmes, but I can say that these ads were aired quite frequently on both Radio and TV. Given the sheer size of UP and Bihar in terms of population then(50 years back), I would say, mathematically, it was the reduction in fertility rates in these 2 states that majorly drove the fertility rates for the whole country.(That is, if you're looking at state-wise contribution rather than socio-economic reasons). The actual answer IMO is in decentralizing power, so that even if delimitation is done based on population central government doesn't get much to do for stuff that might affect different regions differently. Of course, current dispensation wants the exact opposite of that, for obvious reasons. Split UP into at least 3 States. This was proposed for decades but never taken seriously Wow!!!! A delicious debate at last!! Thank you all who have put forth your views forward and educated the rest of us. Yea but that won't be till around 2100 And how does that solve southern states‚Äô representation issue? It will still be the same in parliament. Germany‚Äôs system is so complicated half of our politicians even wouldn‚Äôt understand it. Also, Germany is not as diverse of a country as USA or India so, there is no way to say if southern states will agree with that. Yes it's barbaric to restrict individual rights in today's time especially when overall abortions in US are going down with enhanced access to contraceptives. Of course religious fanatics will try to stop that too Fck this tyranny govt we need to save our india fron dictatorship You're terming people majority and minority based on their vote? Lol Religion is more complex in bihar , here, hindutva dosen't exactly play big role ,caste is a big factor in bihar, if you are a dalit you are barred from entering a brahmin village, and these peoples are proud of it.....so, it's obvious bjp didn't won a majority . Start distributing wrt to the GDP. Let us see what happens next Just trying to understand what the population policies were. I believe a possible solution is to step 1: allocate seats according to the population (as shown in the chart) and then step 2: penalise/reward states proportionally to their performance against the population policies. Stats (especially standard deviations and medians/averages) can be used effectively to penalise states that have done significantly worse in that metric. This method will do two things: 1) allocate seats roughly according to the population (as a democracy should) and 2) incentivise the governments to control population to not get penalised. Since UP and Bihar are already way ahead of their expected populations, they should initially be heavily penalised but smoothened overtime as their populations are being effectively managed. Just throwing out ideas. I‚Äôm interested to learn more about other solutions that anyone has. Atleast in Rajya Sabha each state should be given same no of seats, that way the south and non hindi states will have some voice in national politics All these solutions are the same and useless. The only way to go forward is to break up these high population states Arey that two programmes were done pan-India, I was asking for specific cases or is it just an implementation or cultural failure. As I mentioned, more women are given freedom and work in other states. Unlike a system of working husband and a housewife, women empowerment reduces growth effectively. I am not familiar with the bicameral system in Indian parliament. How does the upper house, the Rajya sabha balance the power of at all? I hate myself for laughing at this how even- the UP Bihar regions were extremely populated throughout history, your argument is based on a false assumption that All the states were evenly and equally populated and UP Bihar somehow changed for the worse. UP, Bihar and Bengal were always the most densely and highly populated regions in the world forever. Well UP would have more localised and diverse politics. No party would be able to dominate the entire region. Thus it wouldn‚Äôt be a UP domination of the country. The federal structure of the country, including southern states would be protected by more political diversity in the north. Almost like the founding fathers foresaw this problem and that‚Äôs why we have a rajya sabha Zero originality, and it's just sad that you needed to use it to convey your own opinions, plus just shows how oblivious you are How is it an implementation failure if fertility rates for UP went from 5.8 to 2.4(Roughly 58% decrease)??? If power in the assembly is going to be based on population, then states should also be broken into smaller pieces based on population limits. Applying this policy to only a single part of the setup will cause huge inequalities. The state with least literacy and literate ministers gets to make big decisions. This is so sad for the future. India is NOT gonna grow like this. Look at it from a South Indian perspective. The govt encourages people to control population; the south of India complies.. Every year you see tales of corruption from UP Bihar. You don‚Äôt see them developing even though most of your tax contributions is dumped there. Then cause you complied with govt earlier to reduce population; you get even less representation‚Ä¶ why should the southern states not just form their own union and just secede. Yes you're right. My problem actually is that the regions with a lower seat share in the parliament will end up being neglected because their numbers will simply matter less. This isn't about North vs South or BJP Congress. Even if the tables were turned where South had an overwhelming majority of seats as compared to the Hindi belt, it would still be a problem. And there are two reasons why this becomes a problem: India's diversity and lack of federalism. While India is a federation of states, the individual state governments have limited powers and still have to depend on the central govt for funds and resources. Which means people are also dependent on the central govt over state govt. Secondly laws passed in favour of one region might not be in the best interests of other regions. And since state governments don't really have a choice to not follow those laws, they will be implemented even against the people's wishes. That's just how representative democracy works Tu ban ja. At that Point you might as well divide Tamil nadu since, no southern state should be able to speak for all of south India like, Tamil nadu acts like it represents the whole of south India. It's not like there are other regions which have it worse than south like Bengal, North Eastern states and other Non-Hindi speaking states. Dude! I am from Uttarakhand which was split from UP in 2000 by Vajpayee govt. The level of governance has been much better here as compared to UP. So, I completely support the split of UP in 3 states. Its just that no party wants to risk their chances by doing that Electoral college benefits smaller states You are grossly oversimplifying it. Of course, any party will try to get seats from everyone given that they have infinite money but the State funds are limited. And all the netas in power will try to impress poor voters in North belt with freebies from that limited money. The amount of improvement in quality of life in South will definitely suffer because of that. *kamal ka fool desh ki sabse badi bhool.* aren't u the sad one here, who has to look around for environmental variables to try to disprove my argument instead of trying to answer it head on- gpt also provided me with counter arguments but it was me who selectively chose what i put up plus i was bored and was using chat gpt at that time so thought i should check what he thinks- if i really just wanted to attack ur character- i could have brought up the fact about how u committed the greatest sin on reddit That gives rise to another kind of fuckery btw. Quarantined. ‚ÄúPeople are breading like hamsters in the south, they will soon take over India‚Äù. TFR behind the curtainsüòÇ their is a simple solution, no devolution until UP and Bihar contribute more taxes than they get back. At least then their is a incentive for them to work and improve, and secondly major states which have contribute immensely to the economy like Maharashtra, TN etc should have a special ministry focusing on their development esp infrastructure funded completely by Delhi, otherwise China will the biggest beneficiary of the coming fiasco. Then it will be like pre - revolution france where aristocrats have the most power Democracy has cons and pros This would have been a pro if UP Bihar were educated enough. Still I'll say this is a basic definition of democracy > IMO a country with 330 million people (US) has 50 states while we Indians are 1500 million with 28 states only, which doesn‚Äôt make sense. I think we should break the states into smaller parts, especially the bigger ones like UP and Maharashtra. This will ensure that a single CM won‚Äôt be Kingmaker (looking at Yogi here) while also making it easier to govern 2000pc agree on breaking the states into more parts. How much tax are you paying ? By this logic Ambani should be supplied with most facilities because he pays more tax, why distribute rich‚Äôs wealth to poors. I would ask you to do basic research before commenting. India's Fertility rate is 2.0 which is at replacement level. But most Southern State's fertility rates are either 1.6 or 1.7, which is below replacement level. So, they actually need to work on increasing their fertility rate. Meanwhile, UP has a Fertility rate of 2.4 and Bihar of 3.0, they need to work on reducing the fertility rate. Well if south India was a separate nation I‚Äôd argue for that too. But it isn‚Äôt so I won‚Äôt. Let's see for every 100Rs a South Indian pays as tax they receive Rs 1 back from Centre government While for UP/Bihar, for every 100Rs tax paid they get approx 900Rs back from Centre.... And Ambani doesn't pay the highest tax, you need to look at the ratio he earns and pays as tax .... The country runs because middle class people earning upto 25k a month are paying taxes religiously, most rich have means of evading taxes .... They convert their wealth by buying artwork and she'll companies and leave the nation to rot Current loksabha seat distribution, Southern states: 130 seats, ~23% Up + Bihar: 120 seats, ~22% After 2026, total seats: 848 Southern states: 165 Seats, ~19% Up + Bihar: 222 seats, 26% What nonsense is this OP? **15th finance commission is clearly giving importance to those states which are doing better in population control..** and the kind of imaginary picture is being posted here just to rile up the rivalry is nonsense. No one wants population going out of sync with development and go so high to manage.. Its based on population of those regions , they need more representatives. This is the need of the hour , its not 1950s , this is 2023 ,and eventually all things change over time. And no matter how many states protest this will happen eventually if not soon then in coming 20 to 30 years. Hope you understand what Nation building is. If South India is so developed why isn‚Äôt India is considered as developed nation ? Every state has its fair representation in Nation building. Bihar has been supplying crucial Human resource to entire nation. I understand that people in Bihar and UP ofter miss use their allotted share, but still there are people who don‚Äôt have access to toilets, electricity, hospitals etc. It‚Äôs not Bihar‚Äôs fault that they were left with very poor HDI at the time of Independence. The geographical location with rich plains made most of the heartland a target/invasion. You can‚Äôt compare 1-1 and times change, it‚Äôs very much possible that in near future these states will be responsible for most of the economic activities (assuming people become more honest there), and people from southern states have to migrate there for employment. Nothing‚Äôs permanent. Yogiji bulldozed my mansion because I laughed at your joke. I want justice I understand hearing undesirable things about the places you come from may feel repulsive, but the question here is about reducing the voice of Southern people in the democracy, which is as important for nation building. Instead of viewing them as fodder, they shouldn't be punished for leading by the example. After 75+ years of independence, some of us have given up on a few states. Means more mandir masjid wala drama from 2026üòê geography does not care about how people feel. bihar and jharkhand by all means are eastern indian states. that does not mean anything above karnataka is north lmao. the north is an identity that is exclusive only to rajasthan, up, himachal, jnk, uttarakhand, punjab and delhi I‚Äôm not from any of the state mentioned/affected in/by the argument. The problematic thing is our vs theirs mentality. Also state division is not the best thing, especially in a country like India, which is rich in resources and high on population. Already know Karnataka vs Tamil Nadu water disputes, AP vs Telangana, MH vs Karnataka etc,There are numerous opportunity for disputes between states, thus it‚Äôs best not to have it more and preserve the federal structure of the country on the basis of population. A state is mere administrative unit, don‚Äôt associate an abstract line mapped by Britishers/rulers with your culture/pride. Yeah there's no federal structure that isn't flawed in some way If anyone tries to pull this shit, I'll be on the streets protesting let them arrest me or beat me to shit, I'll still protest! This is just unfamiliarity speaking, it isn't any more or less complicated. The German system is a lot similar to ours unlike the US system and people already easily understand the difference between general, state and local elections, what constituencies are and how individual MP, MLA, etc are elected so I don't see why anyone wouldn't understand it. In the German system there are two sets of seats. One set is exactly like ours, single member constituencies where whoever gets the most votes is elected. The other set is elected based on proportional representation in each state (for example if BJP gets 60% and INC gets 40% in Rajasthan, they'll get 15 and 10 seats respectively). You get to cast two votes (one for your constituency and one for proportional). If you are worried that Bihar will contribute for Bjp you are mistaken. Bjp is now tata bye bye khtam from Bihar. Caste equation is so tight here in favour of Mahagathbandan. Interesting, was their a furor over the distribution of resources, like they got that, we want this and it's unfair for us. You really think Modi will allow Yogi to be a kingmaker? Or Amit shah would allow Yogi to be the kingmaker? They can't allow him to be this powerful. They definitely have a solution. Just wait for it. Lets Gooooooo BJP \\> Tyranny of the majority. Hindi heartland is not the majority. Never was. Let us assume that BJP wins all the seats in the present 15 ruling states, which amounts to 448. Thats 53% of the total parliament strength. There's only one slight issue, which is that BJP won't win every single constituency in every state it's ruling in right now. The other states' electoral power has slightly decreased, But it's not the end of the world. \\> Diminished representation for smaller countries Only ever so slightly. Most regional powerhouse states (WB, TN, Kerela, Andhra and Telangana, and Odisha) have always voted their respective regional parties which make about 28%. Karnataka is a swing state, so it may lean either BJP or Congress. \\> Inequitable resource distribution This is the exact opposite in India, so this doesn't make sense. \\> Homogenization of policies and perspectives Center-State disputes would (and has) never allowed this. India has always been a welfare state, so there's not really much homogenization of Ideas and policies. And then there's the High courts which can (temporarily) stay the order. \\> Lack of accountability and corruption Which government has ever been accountable? \\>Disenfranchisement and voter apathy Every \"rich\" and \"prosperous\" states have the most politically conscious (especially WB, TN, Kerela, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Karnataka) voters, not really an issue. \\>Committed the greatest sin on reddit Nooo, wtf will i do now?? :(((( It won‚Äôt. Local government will become much more responsive. Isn't that me? üò≥üôÇ Check the issues in the US with your proposed system. In such a system , if each state has 1 vote, but population varies hugely then that is an issue. For example southern states have less population but are more racist and backward. The northern-east coast states or ones with big cities like Washington or New York have huge population with people accepting of diversity but have only 1 vote same as one southern state. Thing is when there are 10 southern states with population of 100 each, and 6 northern such states but population of 500 each, the northern states with more population and better/progressive policies still lose as they have only 6 votes. The southern had 10. A better proposal would be an EU like system, where each state is given enough power to be administered on its own. The Federal union then can serve for top court, overall broad administration aspects and military, organizations like NASA etc.. Because each state has more right to the budget it makes, each state will be forced to earn more for themselves. The argument would be northern states having to fend off enemy nations, but south can compensate by managing maritime forces or navy and reserve armies. Also the issue with water management (how much share each state gets, business/trade laws/rules amongst states). The current opposition is because , as 1 party gets strong in few states with more parliament seats , they ignore the development of others and if needed would outright oppress the states where they don't need to win. This is completely against the spirit of the idea of India as a nation. This will never happen. The southern states would have no reason to stay in the Indian union if this was to happen. No one is that stupid. firangi language alert. shoo go back to pakistan or hindustan. This is not the united states of Awadh Speaking as Tamilan, we are not even pissed that our tax money goes to North. We are just frustrated that there is no convergence in the social indicators, despite the proportion of tax shares from south has been increasing consistently over time. Give us some development to show that our money is used properly to uplift people. I agree, hence the rebuttal to View 2. Electoral college would cause even more trouble here in India. My proposal is breaking the states down into more manageable pieces; benefits would be decentralisation and ease of governance. The North will still dominate national politics but the idea of Kingmaker states will be dissolved. Like, if UP gives birth to 4 smaller states, they would eventually start cycling between different political parties, fracturing an absolute mandate during the Lok Sabha elections. Equal representation of states would be highly non-democratic soo I dont think its a good idea. bruh I dont get why people hate up soo much its way way better than most of the indian states now but idk wheres the hate coming frm? So when we are discriminated on the basis of our vs thiers it's fine and democratic... If we don't support it, then it becomes British colonial minded peeps ... what a hypocritical way of life In Deshbhakt he said maybe we can fix this problem by giving more Raj Sabha seets to the south, giving them more power and a slight upper hand in the upper house. This could help them make better decisions in favor of everyone, and not north Indian centric only! Yes someone who thinks 4 children is good is fine with 6 or 10 children too. Source my great grandparents had 18 children, other families had even more during British raj. Yes but the timeframe the smaller Tatti-pieces becomes Non-Tatti also gets expedited relative to if a single large piece is kept. Similar principle in using excrement as fertilizer. Can't dump large amount in 1 place (can literally kill plant), break it up so soil can absorb without getting overwhelmed. If I am a minority from a gerrymandered constituency, my 1 vote is equal to 0 vote. The reasoning behind loksabha constituencies fall flat if voters can be conveniently grouped to empower majority and cutdown minority by fabricating convenient borders in the first place. Indeed, State breakup is the only solution. In fact this should be baked into Constitution and be automatic, as in as soon a State falls in X-Y% range (this can be negotiated, the principle is what matters) it has to be broken up in half. This sort of is being done even with UPI apps getting majority market share, it's not a hard concept to deal with. It is not happening because of political shenanigans. And once it does happen, EVEN IF say UP as 5 new States has 5 CMs from the same Party, they still would eventually end up doing things which are self-serving because that is the logic of politics. This weakens the State's power on the national scale but elevates People's voice in net term since they now have more representation (State & at Center). It kills multiple problems with 1 action. Should have happened decades ago. In fact even the Chinese SEZ system is a specialized version of this strategy. The principle is same (smaller administrative Units having greater Political-Economic-Policy autonomy and inter-unit/State/SEZ competition driving development). India could not do mass-migration from inland heartland to coastal areas (the idea Andra will accept 30-40-50 Million North Indians across generations to come to their cities is just silly in Indian context because the Central Govt and Indian State at large is a Weak State on such affairs). So the next best thing it can be is what LKY said to both Indian PMs and Maharashtra Govts of past, break cities like Mumbai and let them keep 100% of their revenue. Rest of the state has to raise their game and not freaking suck the bigger cities for survival. This breeds incompetence and lethargy over time into the System. Why do more when the incentive is not to do beyond basic. Break Administrative units into smaller sizes, and see local driven people (like mayors, etc) thrive. Centralization works when the System is tuned for that and there is capacity (like China). India is centralized on paper but in reality in capacity it's banana republic levels of incompetent on Centralization. So either reform this (it can't) or allow smaller units greater autonomy (States can't even do many aspects of direct business/relations with Foreign companies/countries without Center's approval. The Indian Govt is basically a transfer of system fro British to Indian ruling setup. The System is messed up so obviously it will produce garbage). Sorry my friend we'll only build temples. Also make sure you keep working hard. I lived in Chennai for a while and the social system is quite good. Unlike say UP. I am sorry UP and Bihar and other Northern States are basically entitled pricks Agreed üíØ Kindly read it again I never made the assumption instead I implied that if Up, bihar are to be rewarded for not controlling population than it would promote other state parties to increase populations in their states. I totally agree on the point of more federal powers in terms of smaller states. However, state's identify on the basis of linguistics. And I feel that's a major problem in India. Just because I am for breaking down WB into Dooars and Bengal, doesn't mean I don't identify with Bengalis. Two states can speak the same language, share the same culture, but be different in terms of job distribution. I am not devaluing Kolkata - I am simply elevating Siliguri. Bro north has 100s of political parties, it's not easy to get a majority alone from north India. In UP alone there are multiple contenders - Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Yogi Adityanath 2 3 4 june 2023 kabir prakat divas Only way to solve this would be. Have three fixed entities. Side A, Side B and side C. Regional political party can choose to be with either of the three sides. Each side picks a candidate before the elections, yes more like American style but this would help stop infighting post elections. Candidate A B and C are sure of who will support and who will against, no horse trading. So if DMK of TN is with Side B then if side B also has support from some party like SP in UP, wouldn‚Äôt they have a better chance of ruling india ? Even with the existing system and south having their own political party like JDS for Karnataka, DMK, ADMK for TN and communists from Kerala how do they even expect their voices to be heard in the centre ? Thoughts ? > 15th finance commission is clearly favouring those states which are doing better in population control That is clearly a lie. Southern states are losing out, with [Karnataka being the biggest loser](https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/5-year-jolt-for-karnataka-as-state-set-to-be-biggest-loser-in-tax-share-under-15th-finance-commission-804851.html) >How is it fair that Southern India and the North East got conquered far less than the North did on account of their geography? You got conquered cuz you fucking suck. What south-run dictatorship are are you talking about? Ten out of India's 14 PMs, namely Nehru, Shastri, Indira, Rajiv, Charan Singh, VP Singh, Chandra Shekhar, ABV and Modi were either from UP or representing UP. Gujral was an RS MP from Bihar. 51 out of 75 years have featured a PM from UP or BH. And every single long running PM except Manmohan is a UP MP. Btw I am not counting 5 of Indira's 16 years as she was MP from Medak. Despite that, when two-thirds of the time (including the present time) have featured an MP from UP/BH as the PM, what southern dictatorship is this? > The govt encourages people to control population; the south of India complies Every single state in India has had a significant reduction in TFR. There is not one state that hasn't made progress - poorer states will take longer, because that's how demographics work. > Every year you see tales of corruption from UP Bihar You see tales of corruption everywhere, though admittedly it's greater in certain states. Does that mean voters should be penalised? > You don‚Äôt see them developing This is just not true - every state in the country has been improving on the vast majority of metrics. We've been on a long-term forward march since independence. > you get even less representation The problem is you're grouping people together in states, and not looking at each Indian as an Indian. The fundamental question is, should the Lok Sabha proportionately represent the people of India, not the people of our various states. > why should the southern states not just form their own union and just secede. It's something they could always try. If you don't believe in the country, that's your prerogative. Yeah that's it, it's not the geography. Where does this hate come from? > Make Rahul or Nitish PM and they will still impose gareebi-Urdu in East and South like Pakistan did to Bangladesh Except the UPA didn't impose Hindi. Also weird way to denigrate a language for no reason. > they'll still demand more tax from South Wealthier states should pay more tax. > flush into the northern sinkhole Great way to describe your fellow citizens. > So now you want to give Delhi control of partitioning people like British did to Punjab and Bengal It's both hilarious and insulting that you're equating the partition of Bengal or Punjab to the Telangana getting statehood. > Northie Congress Except Congress had won multiple seats in the South in 2009, across AP, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. Exactly. But what will happen instead is: - population will be used to justify why southern states should receive less tax money than it sends - population will also be used to justify why southern states should receive reduced representation - the union govt will promote movies that demonise southern states. Expect a Karnataka Story and Tamil Files eventually - the union govt will centralise more policy making and financial powers in its hands - when the southern states dare to spend money on their own people, they will be blamed for indulging in \"freebies\" And geniuses in this sub will ignore all of that and parrot the one-person-one-vote line while pretending that all the above and the history of population control in this country is irrelevant. I think we have to face this inevitable fact: southern India is going to increasingly have its money and representation taken away over time. How on what basis? Plz tell me.. isn‚Äôt population control given importance? Favouring isn‚Äôt the correct word I used earlier but instead I should have used ‚Äògiving importance‚Äô to or benefits to.. There is no issue. Representation will be proportional to population as it should be Lol, no. Next UP will be devided in 20 states and get 20x seats > The southern states would have no reason to stay in the Indian union So according to you, southern states will stay in india only if they get disproportinate voting power? So much entitlement That's true. I'm from UP myself and I can confirm that any state the size of UP cannot be governed from a single centre. It would be wise to split the state in at least 3 parts. Also, as far as the 'tatti-tatti' point that was stated above is concerned, any split of the state would drastically reduce the power of Yogi or any other future CM. You can't be the CM of two states at once. With no control over the state machinery, there is always a possibility of losing in one of the split states. Also, keep in mind any idea of splitting UP also includes the creation of a unified Bundelkhand state by clawing out the bundelkhand districts from MP. The opposition will have a pretty good chance of winning in such a state. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no hope for UP to get split right now. The only real chance might arise in a post-Modi conflict between Yogi and Shah. > They are disproportionately increasing the seats based on population growth How is it disproportionately? it is **the** definition of proportional. One person, one vote Fair point, but a better way to address the concerns here would be to let the delimitation be as it is and reform the Rajya Sabha. We can also debate on increasing the participation of the Rajya Sabha and giving them veto rights over certain subjects. One thing that baffles me about this debate about north-south-delimitation is the fact that we have already had this debate 75 years ago during the drafting of our constitution. The constitutional assembly debates are freely available. It was for this very reason that we were organised as a bicameral legislature. Questioning the system of representation based on population is very risky as that would result in reframing the entire constitution. Interesting viewpoint, have you actually read these debates? Did they also discuss how will expansion happen in future? Read them, but like 5 years ago. Don't remember much. What I do remember was that even at that time there were concerns about certain states having an advantage if the seats are given population wise. That's why it was decided that we should go for a bicameral legislature. I don't remember the rationale for not opting the senate model of the US but I think that was also discussed. >Did they also discuss how will expansion happen in future? Will have to check this. Fir tum politics join Karo aur system ko badlo Screw this. I will protest this if it takes place for real. South + Maharashtra need to be strong and oppose this. Parliament seats cannot be distributed just based on population. as a ghaziabadi, i say again that UP needs to broken down into 5- states Yes. It's a hugely useful method for a diverse country like India According to me they won‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm not South Indian. Nobody agrees to a losing deal. They won‚Äôt let more populous states to hold more power. Or at least there would be massive upheaval It's not a \"deal\" or \"negotiation\". It is just how country works. One person, one vote and proportional representation > there would be massive upheaval It may be and govt may have to deal with it. But it is no reason to withhold rights of each citizen to have equal voting power Neither is fine. Personal recommendation-Just leave reddit and Twitter then see if you find any discrimination based on personal experience. Social media platforms are designed (or people of vested interest make them) to be provocative. Leave them be happy. Still doesn't change the issue at all it's still a massive block of votes These fucks will keep getting seats and we'll have 20 goas eventually with each having as many seats as each south Indian states No. Not really. There is a parameter called demographic performance, which in theory should do that. But it has been scaled by population, which defeats the purpose. UP with a TFR of above 2 happens to be a state with a very good demographic performance. So we have only 3 years to run Outta India and find a peaceful life elsewhere It is population based because that's called equity. It's fair representation for all states. Check how many seats North-Eastern states other than Assam and Bengal have. If it were equal for all states, then it would be unfair to states with larger populations. You cannot blame them for having larger population. It's not anyone's fault, that's just the way it works. If one state A that has half the population of state B but has the same seats then it's unfair to the people of state B. Kerala isn't being punished. What you are doing is stating it as an issue when it isn't. What happened when the first Vande Bharat train went to Kerala I wonder. I guess those people putting up the face of the Congress MP aren't counted among the literate. I asked chatgpt now >Ultimately, after extensive deliberations, the Constituent Assembly adopted the principle of population as the primary basis for allocating seats. However, to address concerns regarding the over-representation of highly populous states, a formula called the \"principle of parity\" was also incorporated. This formula sought to ensure a reasonable balance between the principle of population and the principle of equality among states. UP had a fr of 5.8? Jesus Just repeating Shashi tharoor's words, sometimes he speaks good and sometimes total rubbish. Want to know the reason why mineral rich states like Bihar, jharkhand, eastern UP, parts of MP and Chhattisgarh are poor is because of freight equalization policy which was implemented just after independence till the 90's. Average bhikari pradeshi be likeü§™ that is splendid Maybe if up ends up gathering most seats it might also have complex politics. Centralisation of any power leads to internal splits. But this is pure conjecture on my part. We need to move to a more direct representation, first past the post system is way past its time. Currently a party winning 30% votes is able to get more than 50% majority which is a farce. Proportional representation will balance out some of the negatives. No single party will be able to dominate. > Punjab are the highest achievers in population control Punjab literally has the third lowest TFR when comparing just states (behind Sikkim and Goa) and the seventh lowest when you add in the UTs. What a retarded comment!!! Tum jaiso ki vajah se hi ye halat hai. So did BJP in South. Both the parties put their Southern and Eastern leaders in the back burner. Their Delhi arm has the final says on everything. >It's both hilarious and insulting that you're equating the partition of Bengal or Punjab to the Telangana getting statehood. Telengana secessionists were not majority. Not just that Telengana nationalists wanted their state on discriminatory line, they did not want spend their Hyderabad IT money to develop Telegus in the three undeveloped and calamity affected regions of AP. So yes it is an insult to compare with partition, bu not in the way you are thinking. northern sinkhole, Great way to describe your fellow citizens. nice strawman. It is evident the citizens don't get the money on their hands, their corrupt institutions do. Except the UPA didn't impose Hindi. >The DMK won the 1967 assembly election and the Congress Party never managed to recapture power in the state since then. The Official Languages Act was eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress government headed by Indira Gandhi to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages. This effectively ensured the current \"virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism\" of the Indian Republic. There were also two similar (but smaller) agitations in 1968 and 1986 which had varying degrees of success. Wealthier states should pay more tax. I don't deny that? Nor do I deny they should get less share. Why for 70years the two states are still medieval? If development actually took place with the tax money these 7decades, then the expectation today would have been all states are becoming near par such that all pay tax near equally and also get equal development back. Also weird way to denigrate a language for no reason. Like how sasta-Urdu don't have standards prescribed and can't decide whether to be sasta prakrit or sasta farsi? How much Hindi literature is there that isn't Urdu first? And you guys denigrate people speaking broken sastaUrdu. Empty vessels make most noise, need most validation, need to impose most. Are you even Bengali lol. Not a day goes by without being forced to listen to some sastaUrdu outside Hindustani states Like coastal invasions never happen lol. If anything thats more effective. Nordic invasions into Greece and Russia, US coming to Japan and European shores in enemy territories. Hell our own Chola Empire ruled much of SEA. Even Pala or some Eastern ones had success. It just you all who suck. As if there was no pirate raids from Singapore and Hormuz. ultrabaysed fir aapse achi toh tatti hi hai, kam se kam taer toh leti hai PROPERTY IN GURGAON

from himachal (an actual north) doesn't have any cultural identity to it. I didn't say anything about the north. Just how south is defined culturally. You can find other definitions here: I am from the south, explain why I should even care about this. Hindutva is a problem for everyone in this forum It is not a problem for most people in the south who are Hindu or even Christian. This only affects the 'peaceful' community who think they own the Deccan. I am the least bit bothered about any loss of parliament seats since the southern states already have a massive economic advantage and if the actual educated community (i.e.Hindus and Christians) in the south decides to ally with the very likely hindutva future we benefit greatly from a hindutva future. United States of South India ...its TIME.. This is unfortunate for the country, cow belt states will keep electing illiterate politicians forever. Ye rastafari flag lagri h It‚Äôs not horrible system. It‚Äôs stable, it gives equal rights to small states and ensures that they don‚Äôt get bullied by large urban states. People complain about it now because it‚Äôs polarized and they can‚Äôt steamroll others into accepting their laws. People of all states must be relatively happy in order for a federal democracy to work.. or you‚Äôll have separatist movements. Just turn it into a US style senate with equal representation for each state. Bro, children are getting murdered in school every day, and you all can't ban guns. Any political system that allows this to happen is not a good system"
