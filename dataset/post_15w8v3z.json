Doesn't matter if they are poor or rich or uneducated or educated. Kind people do exist irrespective of their status or job profile and I hope to be one whenever the opportunity arises. You never know what other has experienced so being kind seems like an obvious answer.\nBut, one cannot avert their eyes from the darkness of this world we live in... I have experienced and observed many many things, and such experience led me to believe that a person need not need a reason to be... bad (for the lack of words)\nI mean for example, during my college, we had a course where we were required to survey nearby villages. Institute planned a guided tour for those villages. Before the tour, we were told several rules such as don't talk to alone people, don't go near certain regions, don't go there, don't ask blah blah. At first, I thought it was a normal thing for a guide to tell us such things for our safety. As we went ahead with our survey, turns out all those \"rules\" was for us to avoid certain caste of people. Over there I observed what I have read in the books about being an untouchable. It's harsh and brutal and our professors told us to do or say nothing about it to the village residents.\"We are here for observing and collecting survey data for a certain purpose, let's keep our heads where it matters, talking to them surely won't do us anything good\" said the professor. Mind you it was not a small village, it was a town-sized village with supermarkets and all. There was no lack of resources or anything that would need some sort of system to make sure certain people can benefit from certain resources. Just like casteism, all of this was pointless for the \"better\" caste.\nThis was one of the eye-opening experiences. Believe me... villages are not the place you go looking for morals or ethics. \n\nAnd I know maybe this is a one-time experience and it doesn't happen in all villages, I cannot generalize a single experience to every village. That is true, but for what it's worth we surveyed every village in MP. You can read about the survey (not the Casteism stuff) by searching REP IIM Indore. Our groups during that time were filled with various practices of casteism. And the worst part? Those who said the most against it were the ones who practised it inside the college. That's a whole other chapter of pure evil where the most educated group of people I have ever witnessed or interacted with are demons in disguise, this is nightmare fuel for people who believe education means a better person.

No suspensions, no transfers, You are fired until you are proven innocent. Read what I said again. I did not say that being educated makes you more moral. I said that being poor and uneducated does not make you more moral. Also, your personal experiences dont mean anything at a population level. The plural of \"anecdote\" is not \"data\". Lol why would I get offended because someone feels poor, uneducated people are better than affluent, educated people? I generally don't get offended by ignorance. I never said poor, uneducated people aren't moral; only that those qualities are do not result in more moral people in an of thenselves. He might have kids. Outing him like this would destroy their lives forever. &#x200B; Pati to parmeshwar hota hai. I think it's too late for you. Maybe you can try again tomorrow when you are in your senses and can string a few proper words to construct a meaningful sentence. I am not going anywhere, okay? We still have time for your generalize and wrongly deduce further and call a stranger on the internet ignorant. You are awesome bro. I hope this helps you sleep better without your regular pills. Ok buddy. Look both ways before you cross the street. I’m always afraid to read ahead when the title starts with Delhi “man/officer/etc” I mean I agree that people who are kind and overall a little logical are so so so humble and kind, you can almost feel like you're in a soap opera or something because of their unbelievable nature. Doesn't matter if they are poor or rich or uneducated or educated. Kind people do exist irrespective of their status or job profile and I hope to be one whenever the opportunity arises. You never know what other has experienced so being kind seems like an obvious answer. But, one cannot avert their eyes from the darkness of this world we live in... I have experienced and observed many many things, and such experience led me to believe that a person need not need a reason to be... bad (for the lack of words) I mean for example, during my college, we had a course where we were required to survey nearby villages. Institute planned a guided tour for those villages. Before the tour, we were told several rules such as don't talk to alone people, don't go near certain regions, don't go there, don't ask blah blah. At first, I thought it was a normal thing for a guide to tell us such things for our safety. As we went ahead with our survey, turns out all those \"rules\" was for us to avoid certain caste of people. Over there I observed what I have read in the books about being an untouchable. It's harsh and brutal and our professors told us to do or say nothing about it to the village residents.\"We are here for observing and collecting survey data for a certain purpose, let's keep our heads where it matters, talking to them surely won't do us anything good\" said the professor. Mind you it was not a small village, it was a town-sized village with supermarkets and all. There was no lack of resources or anything that would need some sort of system to make sure certain people can benefit from certain resources. Just like casteism, all of this was pointless for the \"better\" caste. This was one of the eye-opening experiences. Believe me... villages are not the place you go looking for morals or ethics. And I know maybe this is a one-time experience and it doesn't happen in all villages, I cannot generalize a single experience to every village. That is true, but for what it's worth we surveyed every village in MP. You can read about the survey (not the Casteism stuff) by searching REP IIM Indore. Our groups during that time were filled with various practices of casteism. And the worst part? Those who said the most against it were the ones who practised it inside the college. That's a whole other chapter of pure evil where the most educated group of people I have ever witnessed or interacted with are demons in disguise, this is nightmare fuel for people who believe education means a better person. Nope. Men, Women all same. Assholes Why? Are you gonna come in the wrong way and ram me with your mobility scooter? Please don't kill me. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. There's a possible legal angle here. If the girl was the rapist's friend's daughter, revealing his name in the media might reveal her identity and that is strictly forbidden by law now. Imagine the girl's life when she is finally ready to move on 5 years from now and the article names her or identifies her and this stays on the internet and comes up when she approaches some authority or politician for something entirely unrelated and they bring it up thoughtlessly, like Indians usually do, ans start being nosy in the name of sympathy. Khandan ki izzat Yes reading the post title is enough to send a chill down the spine. Their locality will know it by now and tomorrow the news will be published with the mugshot of that fucker then who will be to blame? Crime never bails. If there's anything better I've learned from Crime patrol it's crime never bails. No amount of hiding could help this monster and finally it got out. The most depraved, most disturbing,most sick unimaginable thing's go on in India idk how a race of people can be like this ! This is the first time he got caught Delhi Officer Probably, since I'm educated and, thus, of low moral character. I can’t. This is beyond terrible. Indian men always raping Is he convicted? If not, he deserves his anonymity. It's 2023 and you guys are still blindly trusting the victim's story as the gospel truth. Right wingers love this Stat and keep posting shamelessly on international subs. No wonder everyone around the world think we rape everyone. If the lady indeed tried to bury this ghastly incident, it is likely that there could be more to the matter which the lady doesn't want to be come into the public. These incidents are usually spillovers from extra-marital affairs, often putting victim and their kin in a fix and making it extremely difficult for them to seek justice. > How do people like this end up in a higher position in women and child development department Let me introduce you to [the person](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Irani) occupying the **highest** position in the WCD ministry in this country. She's a former actress from a B-grade TV serial with C-grade opinions who does D-grade drama in Parliament. Expecting anything more from this bunch of idiots is unrealistic. Wish Death note was real. Would write down both their names. If they got reincarnated, would write down their new names as well. And lonely. That's a killer you got there. Half-educated, immoral and lonely.. This. Isnt it a massive generalisation? Another version of the same Article. His name is Premoday Khakha. What a fucking shitty world we live in. Can't imagine what that girl must have gone through. Half-educated would mean I'm half moral too so I'll probably say sorry after running you over. Is it? I'm not calling all teachers, priests etc predators, just so you are not confused about what I said. What I'm saying is that predators are generally attracted to such jobs where they have some level of control over the populations they want to assault. What does it mean that she was a class XII student? I'm American and have never heard of that before. It's like giving rabies vaccination after a dog bite I hope self-driving mobility scooters become mainstream soon so your kind can concentrate on stuffing more food, call others ignorant while living in la la land completely detached from reality belonging neither here nor there. It's a fresh day, perhaps you can find some time to go back and reread the original comment. But if it's crippling loneliness, I am here to help you this needs more outrage so the people know this bastards name Premoday Khakha Premoday Khakha:"
