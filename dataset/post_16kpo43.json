        ">This comes after the Finance Ministry, in a communication to the Labour Ministry in early July, pointedly flagged the issue of the EPFO — which administers the Employees’ Provident Fund and the Employees’ Pension Scheme for its 6 crore subscribers — having slipped into a deficit of Rs 197.72 crore, as against its projected surplus of Rs 449.34 crore for FY 2021-22.\n\n>This was cited as a reason for intervening and modifying the interest rate announcement mechanism.\n\n>Indeed, flagging the deficit, the Finance Ministry also suggested that the high EPF interest rates need to be looked at. “Broad congruence between prevailing market interest rate and EPFO interest rate strengthens monetary policy transmission efforts of the Government,” the Ministry said",

        "For people about to enter the workforce: Consider opting out of EPF by submitting Form 11 to your HR for your first job. Once you're included in EPF, you can't opt out later. If you opt out, employers you'll get 24% more take home pay that you can invest in safer avenues like FDs or MFs.\n\nThe original intention of EPF decades ago was good. \n\nBut now, under an opaque sus govt, it's like systematically spending money on lottery tickets in the hopes of getting a windfall. Some people discover down the line that it's near impossible to withdraw their own money out of EPF.",
