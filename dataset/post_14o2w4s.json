    "selftext": "On July 20th, I purchased a pair of white Puma shoes worth 4700 after discounts. They were meant to be delivered on July 22nd; however, they arrived earlier, on July 21st. The sneakers had a crease and white, dusty, and yellow spots on them. Furthermore, there were no tags on the sneakers, and no official Puma shoe box was delivered. As a result, I requested a refund on July 22nd (which is within the time period set by Myntra policy). Myntra has a 5-day pickup policy, so they were scheduled to pick it up by the 27th of July. Despite being called several times, the delivery person did not show up. They finally picked it up on July 29th, in violation of their guidelines. On the same day, late at night, they messaged me, claiming the shoes seemed worn (despite the fact that I did not). In fact, you can see in the picture that I have not even broken the Zip tie thingy, and they denied my refund and reshipped the shoes despite the fact that I refused to accept them. They were scheduled to be reshipped by the 1st of July, but they were not, which is another breach of Myntra policy. When I again contacted their customer service and asked for a refund, they claimed it would take 48 hours for reshipment and then they would investigate for a refund. Every time I contact them, they claim that it will take more than 48 hours for the matter to be resolved. In addition, when I asked the executive for his full name so that I could file a consumer court complaint, he refused to do so. Lastly, when I asked him to lodge an internal complaint for return, he refused to do so and only lodged one for reshipment. All their customer support does is harass you.\n\nFor now, I have filed a grievance with the national consumer helpline. I would like to know if there is anything else I could do except file a consumer court complaint. Can I file a police complaint, and if so, under what sections of the IPC? \n\nPS: I would also like to tell the readers to avoid Myntra, as on further investigation, I realized that a Lot of people faced the same issue where Myntra Declined to give them a refund, stating some nonsense reason. I have never faced this issue with Amazon (Maybe because I am a Prime customer) or Ajio.\n\nOne important thing is that I will be traveling to a foreign country in August's first week to pursue my master's, and in addition, I won't be in India for 10 days in July, so I have little time to sort this out.\n\n[https://www.desidime.com/discussions/myntra-s-new-scam-to-not-refund](https://www.desidime.com/discussions/myntra-s-new-scam-to-not-refund)  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/12z4eux/myntra\\_scam\\_return\\_pick\\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/12z4eux/myntra_scam_return_pick_up/)  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/10g34df/is\\_myntra\\_a\\_scum\\_company\\_nowadays/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/10g34df/is_myntra_a_scum_company_nowadays/)  \n\n\n&#x200B;",
