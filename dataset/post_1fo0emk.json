    "selftext": "The world is full of clever answers in search of a genuine question. When talk of One Nation One Election (ONOE) began, it looked like a grand policy solution in search of a real problem. Either a remedy in search of a disease, or a medicine worse than the disease. It looked like a sequel to demonetisation, another brainchild of a modern-day Tughlaq‚Äôs penchant for something grand sans a vision or a blueprint.\n\nNoting the alacrity with which the present regime has gone about pushing this scheme and reading the Report on Simultaneous Elections in India of the High Level Committee (HLC), I am now convinced that One Nation One Election is not just a quixotic yet harmless fantasy. It fits into a larger political design that has been in the works for long. Originating in the middle-class fantasy to save the republic from the public and the bureaucratic quest to evacuate democracy of its popular content, this design has now fused with the rulers‚Äô desire to tame and defang democracy.\n\nThe 281-page report (18,345 pages with annexures) is a made-to-order document whose conclusions were written into its terms of reference. Just as the RBI was asked to invent virtues of demonetisation, the HLC was designed to discover the rationale for ONOE.",

        "The compulsion to discover a rationale makes for strange reading. The report claims that constant elections account for a loss of ‚Äúabout 300 days in an average year‚Äù in some states like Maharashtra (p.167). The ONOE would offer ‚Äúequitable opportunity to political workers‚Äù (p.155) since the same leader won‚Äôt contest for MLA and MP. Not just that, ONOE would lead to ‚Äúreduction in instances of hate speeches‚Äù (p.156). It would solve the problem of ‚Äúvoter fatigue‚Äù (pp.153-4) ‚Äî a problem I never heard about in two decades of doing research on Indian elections.",

        "It seems like you simply do not understand how the vast diversity could affect the systems that are built on this.",

        "I dont know. It can save some money in the short term, but it has no long term effect on anything. I think it is just busy work for modi.\n\nLike DeMo, he will talk about it a lot and it will not improve anyones life.",
        "This is a gimmick. There is no way these constitutional amendments can pass when BJP has 240 seats. You need 2/3rd majority for passing these"
