        "Playing titalfall 2 campaign. So far it's been fun.",
        "Been playing Horizon Zero dawn and A way out. Horizon zero dawn is beautiful, the lantern ceremony paired with the dialogues by the matriarchs and the music made it way too emotional.  \n\n\nAbout A way out, the game is fun to play due to it's requirement for a 2nd player and the game seems ez af, would recommend it to almost everyone who wants to chill with their friends/partners.",
        "Yo i loved that game",
        "I tried planetside 2 over the last month. Absolute epic battles, never seen anything like that before.          \n\nThen tried Destiny 2. What a beautiful game. Downloaded it for PvP, but ended up mostly playing PvE. \n\nHad to delete both games because I was wasting too much time.    \n\nFinally, I tried Orbiter 2016. Its quite difficult to setup. But after that, its great. Managed to go to the moon, though I haven't landed yet. Will stick to Earth-moon system for now and master it before going to Mars. The author made it open source last year.",
        "Completed CoD : Modern Warfare 3 in beginning of this month. Haven't played anything since. Thinking of playing the witcher.",
        "Rocket League.. Diamond player now ðŸ‘Œ",
        "I am gonna take a moment to point out how Elden ring - aside from stuttering - is very well optimized, runs at 45+~fps on my rtx 3050 xps 15 at medium/high 1200p. \n\nI downloaded it as a benchmarking tool, I am actually playing the game right now lmao.",
        "Wanna play together ? I'm champ",
        "Ps player or pc Or xbox?",
        "Xbox",
        "Pokemon scarlet and violet got announced exited for that after playing Pokemon legends Arceus",
        "Yeah runs well on 16gb and also playable at 8gb",
        "Horizon forbidden west\n\nLoved the first one, but this one was a bit of a letdown, too much of the same imo.\n\nThe first 2/3rds is too similar to the original, only in the final third is there something really different.\n\nAlso played the intro to cp2077, will prolly move onto that this week",
        "Wish I could play it for the first time again",
        "Halo Infinite campaign",
        "Ayo how is no one talking about Elden ring yet?!",
        "A board game- codename\nAvailable online too. Do play it guys. Minimum 4 people needed",
        "Exactly the same feelings, just rushed through it (thanks to Elden ring in the back of my mind maybe) but it didnâ€™t hit the same as zero dawn. Iâ€™m still looking forward to the VR game tho",
        "GOTY contender already and Iâ€™m like 5 hours in lol",
        "The Witcher 3 is a must play.",
        "Such a great game. I had thoroughly enjoyed playing it.",
        "Yeah I heard it's great to play. I haven't played any witcher games yet but I am really eager to play it and complete the whole series. It's a RPG right? Any other RPG's you suggest.",
        "I have been playing it xD it's amazing",
        "Not that hyped :/ \nSeems like a sword and shield\nBut yeah i pray the games get good like before",
        "The Mass Effect series is also pretty awesome. Part one might show it's age but still worth it. Part 2 and 3 are awesome. You could try Witcher 2 as well. The first Witcher is too old now. The Deus Ex series also comes to mind. Really good. These are all action RPGs with strong story and world building.",
        "The great thing about the Witcher is the choices. There is no good path or bad path. It's all grey and all your choices have consequences. Choices like \"throw this baby into the fire\". Don't want to spoil. In the first Witcher I remember having to choose between evil villagers and a witch. The characters are well written. Brilliant voice acting.",
        "It sounds really exciting.",
        "Thanks for your recommendation. I'll look into them.",
        "Have you played Pla it's more like Pla than sword and shield and lighting engine in the trailer was very good yeah the same team which worked on sword and shield is developing it",
        "Played all of them so yeah played Plat",
        "Elden Ring, I am almost 200 hours in and my word this game is phenomenal, almost the best one I have ever played and I have played a lot of them."
