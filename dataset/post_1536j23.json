This train seems to be myth with increase fare already we don't have such facilities to run train faster neither Ambitious project like Mumbai-Ahemdabad Bullet Train completed.

        "Such a bad take. Yes the average speed isn't 160, it still came out to be > 110 on the Delhi Kanpur - Prayagraj stretch. \n\n There is absolute need to decentralize the population choking the 6 major cities, having fast connectivity to cities where people can live and work in a different city is the way the clog gets removed, and other cities get better. You can't improve a city till connectivity gets better, companies are willing to settle there. Just look at the load intercity trains pull on everyday in India!! \n\nFares reduce when you have enough of them running on the route and infrastructure gets better. Flights used to cost a fair chunk of your salary, still does in some part, but as the demand increases the operation costs gradually start decreasing.",
        "VBE are EMUs i.e they don't have a locomotive as such they are easier on the tracks, as a 100 ton locomotive isn't crushing them daily. This isn't a new tech btw, all metro systems are EMUs only but it's the first time they were designed completely inhouse by Indian railways. \n\nAnother feature of EMUs is faster pickup of speed as such they should be in have faster run time than a locomotive train set of similar size.  \n\nSo yeah there is a technological advancent, don't dismiss it as having been done before but the tech knowdlege is spreding across Indian railways locomotive divisons as manufactring picks up with increased local supply chain. You think China went to world biggest makers of locomotives without such iterative process of improvement ? \n\nAs for tracks this a common problem in India, Rajdhaani express trainsets are rated for 130 km/hr of operation,most of them don't even run at 80 km/hr on average in reality. \n\nThe solution to that is to lay more track which we are doing, it'a continious process. Here are new tracks being added. [https://indiarailinfo.com/atlas](https://indiarailinfo.com/atlas), here a resource to check all the new tracks being laid, also includes track doubling/tripling and quadrupling in some cases.",
        "Vande Bharat is more like what's the best possible on the current infrastructure given the limitations. The rail infrastructure is massive and it would cost a lot to build actual high speed train lines covering that wide distances, just look at the Bullet train project. Concepts like Train 18 are trying to find efficiency where they can. Gatiman and Shatabdi did the same earlier. \n\nThe advertising by the govt of course wants to claim it's the best train ever made by anyone worldwide and unfortunately, people will believe that. Plenty of reasons why people believe shit of this govt, no point beating the same old drum. \n\nOn the question of are we progressing, I believe yes. It is a significant achievement to make a train in the country. Otherwise any country can get Bullet trains by taking loans and tech from Japan.",

        "If Vande Bharat is a stunt, then let it be.I am still rooting for it.\n\n\nI don't understand this mentality, why do we have to shit talk about everything govt does. Can't we appreciate something good is being done? \n\n**Vande Bharat may not be the fastest or swankiest railroad in the world, but it's leaps and bounds ahead of what we have had till now**. **It's a step in right direction and sooner and later we will catch up to rest of the world.**\n\nAnd i am against this typical Indian mindset of criticising every thing. \n\nIf govt gives subsidy /freebies , then we call it vote bank politics to appease the poor. \n\nNow when govt builds something for the middle class to enjoy , then we start giving moral lectures about how this money  could have been used for hospitals or what not, why can't we appreciate this was built to appease middle class and we fucking deserve it. \n\nNow before you start criticising that it's very costly, well no Ambani is riding that train, and govt runs enough general coaches to cater to masses.

        "Yes that is true, it's a long way to go, but in this case the govt is trying top to down approach. By making intercity travel experience better, govt wants to cash in the travellers who would have instead flown to other city. \n\nThis affluent part of society, would then be willing to spend more, hence giving incentives to Buisnesses to set up stalls and other services. And when these buisnesses come , they will want clean stations and working amenities,hence intentivizing stations to keep cleaner to attract more buisness. Thus by making it good for the rich, the poor inadvertently benefit. Govt can't keep a station clean if it's not making money.\n\nCase in point, compare the stations of Delhi and jaipur metro. Delhi metro stations are sparkling clean while jaipur metro stations are in sorry conditions, this is because Delhi metro has buisnesses on its premises and jaipur metro is a ghost town.
