        "Different marriage law for different religion..!  A muslim guy can marry a 15 year old, but a hindu girl can't be married before 18.  Then How can a muslim marry a minor hindu?      Things can only sorted out if we introduce UCC",

        "As much as I hate religion politics:\n\n>As per Mahomedan law, the marriage of a Muslim boy with a girl who is an idolatress or a fire-worshiper, is not a valid marriage. Even if the marriage is registered under the Special Marriage Act, the marriage would be no more a valid marriage and it would be an irregular (fasid) marriage.‚Äù Justice Gurpal Singh Ahluwalia stated\n\nThe correct solution here is for the girl to convert to Islam. M no one is stopping her.",
        "It‚Äôs not the court that isn‚Äôt allowing the marriage. Under Muslim law an inter-religion marriage is not considered valid and the same has been interpreted by the court. When personal law exists then that shall take preference over the other religion-neutral law.",
