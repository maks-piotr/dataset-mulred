The govt will most likely borrow this money by issuing Govt bonds. 1 lakh per year for a dirt poor family is a large amount. It will help their children eat and go to school instead of working and being malnourished. It will help them with money for starting a new venture. It will help them avoid loan-sharks who charge exorbitant interest and keep them poor. It will enable them to be a part of the economy. It will help them become consumers and raise demand in the market, and as a result will help increase manufacturing.\n\nIn short, this influx of money in the hands of the poorest of India is a bet on India's future. It is long-term thinking. It may back-fire and India may get crippled under debt. But it's a bet worth taking. Without it, we'll have ~20% people who do not add any value to the economy. \n\nHowever, let's not worry too much - even the US has trillions of dollars of debt against its name.

    "light_cleaned_comments": "Trivia: Because he's the PM of India he can't get an Oscar directly, therefore for this performance from that 2016 emotional speech, he was given an Oscar indirectly when Oscar was given to \"RRR\", it was like a shell movie, the original Oscar with someone wearing a jhola and roaming here and there giving more speeches these days. /s Trivia 2 Christopher Nolan postponed the shooting of Oppenheimer because he couldn't take a chance to compete shoulder to shoulder with Modiji's blockbuster biopic. Okay, this also /s Indian bureaucrats who are corrupted and criminal politicians will never let him do it. You tend to overestimate Modi power and most people provide funds to the party to fulfill their ulterior motives. Some politicians own hotels, hospitals,colleges and schools and teacher training centres . Do you think that they want to bring accountability to the system ? They deliberately voters uneducated to stay in power and that is they don't spend most of the funds allocated to implement the policies. They only want to mint money and send their children abroad to pursue education and want to carry on their legacy Trivia 3: I'm probably going to jail soon because I have taken a voluntary break from morning walks. 🫶🏻 /s~~~~ Trivia 4: Bhai ne bola karne ka, toh karne ka... Haan mudizi is Yudhishthir avatar also, electoral bonds are the aunty nasunal SC leftist conspiracy. Mudizi ne na khaya na khane diya Everyone wants to join the politics to become rich and powerful and i think Modi doesn't enrich his family like everyone else and Modi may be corrupted and he takes gifts ..i think Modi is after power and prestige and wants to go down like Indira Gandhi like that. That is why he is more focused on maintaining his image and personality in the public and never holds a press conference to create controversy 50 days in Kali Yugam is 500 years in Tretha Yugam. Aah, so that's my mistake only, makes sense. 🤦🏻‍♂️ All the rules are made for common man whereas the ministers and their family live a lavish life. The BJP govt previously stopped the pension of govt employees they didn't do the same for LOK Sabha or Rajya sabha members. They will still get pension, their phone bill is paid by the govt. now at 1000rs they can have unlimited callls n data yet they get 10k for that. peoples money. They make promises to commoners and then says that it was a jumla. THeir should be a law that if the elected gov didn't fulfill thier promises their whole family should be burnt in front of public. Like this we will elimnate bad peoples from our country Modi is nothing but just a joke in the nations face In a country where Politicians, actually where cows and Politicians of other countries (Trump temple in India) are treated like Gods and common people are lynched on the road or die in long queues and the government doesn't even acknowledge it, Well, what else can you expect? Treat them like Gods, they'll make sure you stay at their feet. He asked for 50 days on Miller’s planet, you noobs. So, just to clarify, he's the one on Miller's planet or we're on Miller's planet? If he's on Miller's planet, PROBLEM SOLVED, the next wave would be coming soon. That's some interstellar shit Wondering how many years is that in satya yugam as BJP wants to bring that about right? Your children and grandchildren will read a lot about Modi in their history book Like we do about hitler ? He doesn’t hold press conferences because he can only make speeches and cannot answer unstructured questions without revealing himself as a phony Ekdum kafan baandh ke nikla hai baba tum. Do you know Christopher Nolan read Rig Veda 10 times to get the inspiration for that scene? Everything is in Vedas. I mean the whole thing about the future, bitcoins, AI, celebrity news.... >!/s!< \"Merciless criticism and independent thinking are the two necessary traits of revolutionary thinking.\" - Bhagat Singh\" :) It depends which will be in the power and print books and what they will omit and keep about him It is up to him what things he wants to reveal about himself or what not Tougher to do in an unstructured interviews where you donot control the questions Even nostradamus The problem is that he can manage to do that . And we cannot do anything about it Can we question congress could not do anything about black money even after being 50 years in power? Not defending bjp, but it is a daunting ask for any party. So we should fairly question both of them. He is none other than Naradamuni. When he was in Greece he changed the name to Nostradamus Schrodinger's PM: Simulataneuously the most powerful PM who stopped war in Ukraine and the not so powerful PM who is controlled by bureaucrats around him NostraDAMNus Vote for someone else 🙃 I respect the hustle. Good job, dude But it absolutely should not be up to him. Elected leaders should be answerable to the public, and since not every Tom dick and Harry can ask questions, the media has press conferences. I don't see the Congress being in power. And I definitely didn't see Congress making a promise to bring back black money So would you say that congress never even attempted to bring back black money? At least one party wants to do so (and it has failed to do so yet). Then don't make outlandish promises? No one ever said that bringing back black money is an easy thing to do He has managed to do the same for so many years and do you think people or voters are concerned about his not holding press conference and look at the Gujarat cm tenure and he can manage to do and he knows it What about Rahul Gandhi's promise of giving 1L to every poor woman in India? Isnt that outlandish? If he does do that, it will bankrupt the country. Wasn't it also Modi who said that every Indian would have 15 lakhs in their account? So both of them make such ridiculous claims. I already said that in my previous comment. As one person in 1.4 billion, my views definitely don't count for a lot. But I'm not the only one looking for answers. Moreover, whether he has managed or not managed is not in question here. The real issue is that a democratically elected leader has not answered any media questions in a press conference in almost 10 years. And who passes every law oh wait it's the same politicians 😂 wahi to, futti kismat Hm But once again, Congress is not the ruling party. I will criticise the ruling party because they can implement policies, not Congress. Fair. So you want to vote out bjp because of their outlandish claims and vote in congress so that you can then criticize them for their outlandish claims? But, don't you all get it. We are all getting punished for the black money. It will be an outlandish claim only if they fail to implement it. Are you in favor of giving 1L to every poor woman in the country? Please tell me how would the economic work. It will bankrupt the nation. Assuming 80% of woman will be eligible (as there are these many poor people in India), it is about 68 crore * 0.8 = 53cr women. So 53 Lakh Crore. More like dream time in inception War rukhwa di papa. He posted this self flattering video on his own YT. Narcissism ki bhi seema hoti hai. Waah Modiji Waah! Correction: They're generating more profits from black money. Our existence doesn't matter much to them, we are just daily wage workers for them. They know how to manipulate the majority and dismantle the rest (make them not vote, point out that it's useless). Now if you had really done your research and actually read what the promise was you wouldn't be spouting this BS. It's actually 1 lakh to one woman from a poor family. Idk how this will play out, but i generally tend to favour cash transfer schemes to the poor. They will spend the whole 1 lakh on their basic needs like roti kapda makan, which in turn will lead to economic growth cause there's an increase in demand, etc etc. You can google and figure out how this works. Economists have debated this for a century at least. On one side people complain that tax payers dont get anything, on the other side you promote handing out free money (out of tax payer money) so that people are not incentivised to work. Yeah bro 1 lakh is enough for me to quit my job and sit at home. Are you an idiot or what. This money has only one purpose, that is to lift them out of extreme poverty. 1 lakh is enough to feed even a family of 4 for more than 2-3 months. Let's not even go into costs other than food. If anything the poor in this country work the hardest without being compensated fairly. Bhai yaar ye pehle bolna tha na This is not about people with job, this is about poor women who dont have a job (for any reason, not blaming them). So your entire premise that \"i will not quit my job if I get 1L from Government\" is invalid. This is just vote bank politics, where someone is willing to bankrupt the country to win elections. You are an idiot if you cannot see that. Why do we need to just have two parties? I'm going to vote against BJP, but that doesn't mean I'm going to vote for Congress. I look at the people standing for election in my constituency and select on the basis of that, not on the basis of parties. Also, why do BJP supporters always like to bring in Congress as a factor? Isn't the BJP supposed to be better? If they are better, why are you okay with holding them to the standards as Congress? And if they are the same, then why defend them all the time and portray them as being better than Congress? # Is it time to punish Modi? [https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-of-rs-500-rs-1000-notes-pm-modi-bear-pain-for-50-days-then-punish-me-4373933/](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-of-rs-500-rs-1000-notes-pm-modi-bear-pain-for-50-days-then-punish-me-4373933/) To quote Modi, *\"Give me time till December 30. After that, if any fault is found in my intentions or my actions, I am willing to suffer any punishment given by the Country\"*. You cam vote looking at your area MP, ultimately that will decide who becomes the PM of the country. This should be the headlines in all the leading newspapers and newschannels. You know you can have a job and still be poor Don't know know it's for making digital India. See what we got called UPI other countries are using it too. Demonitization ka asli product tho yee hai. /S /S saved you from my wrath. Handshake. Good one. You say that as a joke but bhakts would actually believe modizi went to gargantua and gave speech Gargantua se mera purana rishta hai!!! 5 crore underprivileged women * 1lakh INR is indeed a large amount of money. The govt will most likely borrow this money by issuing Govt bonds. 1 lakh per year for a dirt poor family is a large amount. It will help their children eat and go to school instead of working and being malnourished. It will help them with money for starting a new venture. It will help them avoid loan-sharks who charge exorbitant interest and keep them poor. It will enable them to be a part of the economy. It will help them become consumers and raise demand in the market, and as a result will help increase manufacturing. In short, this influx of money in the hands of the poorest of India is a bet on India's future. It is long-term thinking. It may back-fire and India may get crippled under debt. But it's a bet worth taking. Without it, we'll have ~20% people who do not add any value to the economy. However, let's not worry too much - even the US has trillions of dollars of debt against its name. Any growing country bets on its future. The 5 crore figure is from a relevant news report: why we are the one who always suffer Our grandparents thought that India would be good for their kids Our parents thought the same now we who won't have kids but still when it was drought in Maharashtra Ajit Pawar was the minister he literally said on stage that if it's not raining should I go n piss on the land for farmers or what. Like, how insensitive you are that farmers were dying the suicide rate of farmers was raising and this kind of statement just proves that they don't have sympathy, empathy for the voters. In recent past 25 people were burnt in bus accident, their body was so burnt that family was not able to take them for cremation at their hometown n on that day Their was this gatbandhan of NDA and Rashtrawadi COngress. c 👀 C H E W T I Y A When did r/India become a Modi hate subreddit Also the PM who can stop a war in Ukraine but cannot stop a conflict between two groups in a state in his own country Demonetization was not a good idea with a bad implementation. It was a downright insane idea. The flaws and lack of basic logic and economics was obvious even to non-economists. The economists of course brought intellectual rigor to the criticism, but anyone applying a bit of critical thinking could have seen it on the day he announced it. Even the Nazi party had a slogan of “1000 year reich”. We know what happened to them, let’s see how the dice rolls now time contraction due to modi's mass simple relativity - 50 days = 50 years > Give me time till December 30. Which year? 3049? It is not hate. It is the criticism that he has rightfully earned and asked for. calling spade a spade is not hating yeah sure ask modi in next press conference he gives,,, oh wait... Bhai ne toh 15 Lakhs ka bhi bola tha See a person in power cannot please everyone. Whatever he does, there are always groups who are negatively affected by it. But because of Modi, India itself is progressing as a whole and getting recognised in the international forum. India is doing much, much better than what it was before 2014. So instead of nitpicking, let's just be happy that we are citizens of a country in steady progress. Indian bureaucrats exercise unbridled power without accountability as there are no checks and balances in india to hold them accountable and they are permanent so the party can be changed through voting but they can't. There is a patronage based system operating so they can stay in offices as long as they serve their masters and most of them are bootlickers and Modi also brought his favourite bureaucrats along with him in PMO. I am not a Modi supporter or hater and I try to analyse things and personality objectively. As everyone has their own aspirations, motives and goals. That is why I can think Modi is not after money otherwise he would enrich his family like everyone else and he is after power and prestige. He knows how to market himself well and he knows what to show, how much and how long and for what . > India itself is progressing as a whole and getting recognised in the international forum. Another form of log kya kahenge? 80cr people are being fed because they are in poverty and you are claiming progress? Instead he is punishing us India is on its track to minimising poverty. Poverty exists in every country. If a group of people come together to form a society, power imbalances are natural and even required. Please do not compare India to some other Country and cite issues that any Tom dick and harry ruler will face. Compare india of 2024 to India of 2014 and see how far we have come > Compare india of 2024 to India of 2014 and see how far we have come By changing the metrics and narrative every time a major issue is faced? Comparing a country to its past is the best metric imo. 2024 India is the best it's been in 75+ years. We have no business comparing ourselves to other countries as they owe their success or failure to the circumstances of their formation, as do we. > We have no business comparing ourselves to other countries as they owe their success or failure to the circumstances of their formation, as do we. Nobody is comparing India with other countries, just pointing at the deceptive ways."
