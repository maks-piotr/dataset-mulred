    "selftext": "Is this some kind of a joke going on? 100 MPs suspended for the remaining session of the Parliament. To anyone who used to follow the political affairs of the country before 2014 would know that when NDA was in opposition there used to be far more chaos than what it is now. This isnâ€™t a great sign for a healthy democracy. This is bizarre and I believe itâ€™s just a sign of whatâ€™s in store for next 5 years at the very least.",
