        "Just picked up Flashback for free from GOG. Really stoked to play it. I remember being awestruck by the game as a kid!",
        "Finished Dragon Age 2. Awesome game. Currently playing pillars of eternity 2 and replaying Doom 2016.",
        "Haven't played dragon age in years, back when i first played it i absolutely hated the sequel. Whereas origins is my all time favourite rpg. Thankfully there's a steam sale going on and im aching for a good rpg that'll keep me hooked, so im thinking of giving dragon age 2 another chance.",
        "Yeah please do. This game gets so much hate for no reason. I do think if you manage to look under the crust you will also see the vision the passion behind it. I love all the characters and their banters and how they develop over the game. And wouldn't have seen this world and the charcaters I come to love so much if I hadn't decided to ignore reviews and play for myself. Same goes for Dark Souls 2. One of my favourite but misunderstood by the mass. They fail to see the vision behind it, they just see the clunky combat.",
        "Oh man i love dark souls 2, its my favourite soulslike game. Not saying the other games were bad or anything they are absolutely wonderful games but idk there's something about dark souls 2 that i find special and i keep coming back to it from time to time. I'll be grabbing DA 2 asap, i kind of miss having that feeling of getting addicted to an rpg. Last game i played which completely hooked me up from the beginning was divinity original sin 2.",
        "Give pillars of eternity games a try to if you can.. From what I understand you like crpgs... you will like this one. This one is a bit combat heavy. Also kinda long I have 157 hours clocked in. But fair warning be prepared to drown in wall of text. As the game is very lore heavy. There is no shame in not reading every book the game has to offer...",
        "Oh wow, pillars of eternity has been on my wishlist forever. I totally forgot about it so thank you so much for reminding me. Also it looks very similar to divinity os, ik different combat but everything else like rpg elements looks very similar. Will grab DA 2 and poe, hopefully it will keep me entertained for a while. Thanks a lot for replying :-)"
