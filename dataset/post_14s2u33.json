        "The Nagpur-Bilaspur section is a pain in the head. Once my parents travelled from Raipur to Nagpur. They were supposed to reach Nagpur at afternoon time, which is the normal time of that train. Except they reached at 11:30 night. That section is fucked since 3 years or so.",

Another problem is their research on time-tables. chennai-mysore shatabdi and chennai-mysore vande bharat leave almost at the same time on same days and reach 30mins or so apart. Absolutely no effort is made to atleast have one in down direction. My father travelled in sc-vskp vande bharat, the incoming train (vskp-sc) was late and so no one bothered to  clean and maintain the rake. this will continue down the years and cost everyone",

The drastic drop from 2021 to 2022 shows the numbers can't be compared. And the 2023 trend looks more in line with 2022.\n\nAlso, for statistical comparison, it's more imperative to have percentage of trains cancelled.",
