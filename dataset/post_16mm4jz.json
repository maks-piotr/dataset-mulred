        "Their modus operandi is fairly simple.\n\n1. Add you to a telegram group with announcements where you cant reply\n2. There you'll see them assigning tasks (like rating in gmaps). \n3. You will have a PoC who will tell you to complete task and give screenshot\n4. Once you do you will get 150 rs legit via upi\n5. This is where the scam starts, in between the rating task they'll throw in a task to invest say 5k (a whole pyramid from 5k to 1L) for the day and get back 6k (a typical scam)\n7. They won't directly tell you to do that task but its expected and they'll say complete all tasks maximize earning\n8. And you will see messages like people getting paid back their money at the EOD which is ofcourse fake (they post payment screenshots from the same account)\n9. The moment you do pay, thats it. they stop responding, remove you from the group.\n\nI did not fall for the last step, just extrapolated based on my analysis. I got about â‚¹600 for free instead ðŸ˜‚. They stopped responding after that.\n\nFYI, of course I'm not a cyber crime employee",
