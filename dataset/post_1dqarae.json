        "If they wanted a modest return on capital, they shouldn't have been buying electoral bonds especially when they were making a loss all this while. And now that burden is being pushed on to consumers of their services, who are not left with any other choice due to the telecom industry becoming a duopoly lately.",
        "Fair enough man. I used more than 2 TB of 5G data on Jio’s 1559 yearly plan. At this point it feels guilty 🙃.",
        "They even removed some of the plans right now",
        "They were waiting for the election season to get over.",
        "They've discontinued the recharge of value plans like 395 because they don't want people to recharge in advance for unlimited 5G.",
        "Not everyone has a 5g capable phone.",

        "Guys we can't reap the benefits of capitalism if we're not willing to accept the downsides.",
        "Destroyed BSNL and gave them access to their towers and look what happens.",
        "Electoral bonds was not an option for most companies (reliance Airtel aside)\n\nIt was just unconstitutional hafta the government was collecting... either pay us or be hounded out of business",
        "Govt owns majority of VI and BSNL. They've already convinced bhakts these should be privatised. There would be firesale between Jio and Airtel who can form a cartel to split up both of these equally and then keep raising prices or degrading performance. Also keep getting government funding to \n\nMasterstroke.",
        "Ever dealth with bsnl?",
        "Yup. Pre 2014 it was not bad at all. They had good plans and I had no issues.",
        "Mate anyone sating bsnl were good is just lying through their teeth.",
        "You do you! The Karnataka circle of the BSNL was pretty chill. We faced no issues. \n\nIn fact, we still have a couple of BSNL products.",
        "Nope. Not everywhere was BSNL bad. Some places it was even better than Airtel and other services. Obviously Jio wasn't a thing back then but still it was good.",
        "There's no more healthy competition in the market after 2014 tbh",
        "My mom used BSNL until 2020, and yes it wasn’t bad. At least in some regions. No 4G but back in the 3G days, it was the cheapest and you could call them up and get 50% discounts making it ultra cheap.",
        "That took a long time. They've been talking about this since Jio came out.",
        "Duopoly",
        "Capitalism benefits consumers only when there's competition. This is effectively a duopoly i.e. where consumers lose.\n\nEarlier we had options like Aircel if we're mobiledata heavy or BSNL if we wanted all India connectivity (just examples).\n\nNow we have no options. Only the illusion of choice. Both players are charging the same amount for roughly the same data.",
        "This might be an unpopular opinion, but they're businesses, for God's sake, and they'll be looking to raise revenue every now and then. They're not here to do social service for decades to come. The prices that Jio and Airtel (rather forcibly) offered for data to common citizens for years were unimaginably low if you compare the same with other countries. The fact that today every dude with a phone has a WhatsApp and Instagram installed on it, is primarily due to these companies. It's not like it'll not itch me to pay more for the same plans now, but I'd rather understand where it comes from.",
        "Sorry to say but I'm having to use BSNL in the current remote village of Rajasthan I'm in, because it's MILES better than the other private counterparts.\nWe're paying somewhere around 1.1k for 300mbps no cap, the private vendors were charging 1.2k for 10mbps :)\n\nSo no BSNL is not shit everywhere. I agree sometimes better options exist in Tier 1 and sometimes tier 2 cities also, but the situation I see here is very much in favour of BSNL",
        "And I cannot even do a recharge prematurely before 3rd July because then it will override my current recaharge. If I have validity of 6 months left and if I recharge for 1 year then my validity won't be 1.5 years but 1 years only. Happened with me.",

        "I have a question, is 1.5gb/day annual recharge of jio same or increased ?",
        "The jio 1599 pack was actually discontinued. I am confused why they have listed it here. Maybe it’ll come back after the revisions.",
        "BSNL had the best rural coverage (atleast until around 2014)",
        "The 1559 one too. Mine is about to expire and I cannot find it.",
        "I wholeheartedly welcome this, i won't mind if they increase it to 50%. Ask me why.",
        "whats the 1559 plan?",
        "Wait a min Airtel too!???",
        "Heading towards a duopoly",
        "If you have Jio then i dont think it will override. I've just recharged for a year and the plan will active after the current one ends. Use MyJio app to know more details.",
        "And my friends, this is called a duopoly and acting as a cartel.",
        "They need funds for the baby elephant's wedding.",
        "This used to be 349/month on Airtel back in 2021 or so when I lived in India. I am shocked that it has more than doubled since then.",
        "I had 15 days left on my plan. I did a 28 days recharge and my validity was 28 days on Airtel. Maybe it was a bug but it was a real one not just a visual one. I am not taking risks now",
        "Its okay, people voted for this shit",
        "BSNL was great for me too",
        "Recharge via agent asap.",
        "It comes from anti competitive practices which were highlighted in the CCI vs airtel case where jio was clearly engaging in predatory pricing however the court judged that jio is not a dominant player in the market hence we can't call it anti competitive behaviour (CCI vs bharti airtel 2016)\n\nBut a duopoly formed now can be pinned on governments willingness to let jio engage in a price war",

Here it is in writing.\n\n5G browsing between 12 am to 6 am is free on my totally basic Vi plan.\n\nThey are honestly single-handedly preventing us from becoming victims of the monopoly Jio sought to create with its predatory pricing and regulatory favours, and it is now reversing that.

Otherwise I think Jio cannot risk not being the cheapest.\n\nTata is not going to come to anybody’s rescue here btw.",

Anyways, if you think you can waste my time then go ahead, I have all the time in the world to waste. \n\nNow with that out of the way back to business. Am I happy with the price hike? You bet I am not bit am I pissed about it? Not at all considering the price hike came after like 2.5 years. I understand the inflation exists and Indian economy is inflationary in nature and prices for goods and services do not remain the same. \n\nAs for my previous point, literally nothing has changed! There is still 198 rs plan with unlimited calling for 28 days and this plan is for people like you that do not want lots of data and extra benefits. That is 2x then what you paid for pre Jio days in 2015 and I'd once again repeat I'd rather pay 350 rs for 56GB of data i.e 2GB/day with unlimited 5G (no data caps) then pay 1024MB data for the same price with calling, SMS charged. We have been over this like multiple times now. \n\nAs a gamer I deal with price hikes every single year on platforms like Steam and this is no different. If you want cheap plans they still exist for you at 200 rs even today.",

        "Ain't nobody (in hyperbole) moving to 3G and 4G when everyone is buying or upgrading to 5G handsets in 2024. If BSNL wants to compete they'll have to massively do better than competition to upgrade to 5G. It took BSNL a decade to switch to 4G when Airtel, Vodafone and Idea were doing it back in 2014-2015. \n\nWhile BSNL can technically survive indefinitely with tax payer money they cannot thrive with that money alone and considering their mountain of debt, huge losses year-on-year for nearly a decade, outdated infrastructure, Government fucking it up everytime.",
        "most people are going to upgrade their phones eventually in 2024/25 and beyond. As far as I can tell 4G phones are not being mass produced anymore in 2024.

        "Man, our full country used mobile internet for free for some time and then at pretty cheap rates. Of course we all knew that this is a common user base capture tactic to kill competition and soon they would jack up prices once they were a monopoly.

Now no more lifetime validity. No more nothing.\n\nThis is market dynamics at play. Duopoly or monopoly is bad for the consumers. Since, they are the only providers they can afford to increase the price, unless some newcomers come to undercut them.\n\nSame is the case with uber, Zomato etc.",
        "But there was a huge reduction in the cost of the internet though. It's not like we didn't benefit.",
        "Most people are not buying flagships. They don't have that kind of money. Many brands have a 4G version of a phone which is cheaper than the 5G one. Delulu is not the solulu.",
        "I know most people dont have that kind of money and I used flagship as an example for 2020 and 2021 phones! You can literally get 5G phones for less than 15000 rs with 6GB RAM, 90hz refresh rate screens, fast charging in 2024.

It happens in other countries too like US.\n\nYou can look at the how uber & Zomato are working nowadays compared to when they were launched.

That's how it's working.\n\n>Here govt isn't letting anyone survive except the chosen blessed ones.\n\nMost of the competition went under because of cheap plans given by jio initially to capture the market. Ambani has a huge income stream from the petro business with which he could sustain the initial losses, but companies couldn't.\n\nAlso, Vodafone went under because of retro tax put on them by gov. This was a double blow to it, they needed to cut the plan cost to survive & pay huge tax to gov. This was done by pranab when he was finance minister. Few years back gov did try to save it, by rolling back retro tax & giving some aid. That's why Vodafone is still operation but is now a small player.\n\nYou can argue on bsnl, but it would have lost market share because of shit customer service & bad management.\n\n\n>Here govt isn't letting anyone survive except the chosen blessed ones\n\nYou can say it for cases like leasing/selling ports/airport to adani etc. and I will totally agree.

You do not have to believe me, just go to any BSNL office, be friends with them, take them out for a cup of tea or whatever, they will tell you many more horror stories than what I shared.\n\nJust imagine, a tender happens, a vendor wins, BSNL pays amount & the vendor delays supplying the equipment.

BSNL however offered significantly cheaper 3G plans compared to the rest 3 big players. \n\nGovernment screwing up BSNL was no secret but at the same time BSNL suffered from legacy issues. Some of my friends had headache dealing with BSNL as their service was completely incompetent here in Goa and the employees acted like they were the Kings. Taking a simple broadband connection would take weeks and require multiple follow-ups and landline connection charges were also forced before they moved to fiber. When disconnection happened internet used to be frequently down for multiple days with no compensation for lost days unless you write physical letter and manually send it to BSNL offices. \n\nRegardless of how they got this huge debt it does not matter what caused it now. It does not matter anymore. The truth is BSNL cannot directly compete with Airtel and Jio. If they could you wouldn't be seeing so slow adoption of 4G services. \n\nForget about growth they should be more worried about just keeping the existing customers happy as the mounting losses continue and total outstanding debt is also ballooning. Do I think BSNL will go bust? Probably not as long as taxpayer money and cash infusion keeps it running and employees keep getting their salaries timely. I just don't think they're going to have 5G internet services ready in before the next decade starts and these guys had 4G in 2020s when the competition had it since 2014-15. \n\nFor comparison BSNL has just 7.5% marketshare as of 2024 and Vi with 18%. Both have been consistently losing marketshare since 2016 and are currently at rock bottom. Only Airtel (33%) and Jio (40%)  are getting net gains in most quarters.",
        "Internet was always a luxury. Now that tarrifs have increased we'll have less stupid people on the internet opiniating for sheit stuff.\n\nWe'll have less people on quora asking \"I have 98LPA is it enough to survive in Bangalore \", less people on indiaTech subreddit asking for next phone or laptop suggestions for their generic requirement and less folks asking how to become a generic software engineer from a person who is in his infancy stages of education on developersindia subreddit.\n\n0 crap and 100% real issues and opinions.",
        "Butthurt? How old do you think I am lol\n\nBro look, I cannot change your mind and neither can you change mine. As for inflation, the biggest brunt of it is delivered to the end consumer which is us. Now if you want to dickr-ride big corpos sucking the life out of the common peoples then please make all the noise you can about inflation. Inflation doesn't only mean unlimited price hikes til the end of time, our incomes have stayed the same for the longest time as well which makes these price hikes unfair.\n\nHey, I game too and steam is quite lenient with sales every now & then and even with the biggest titles you'd get stuff like 50-40% off and steam quite honestly isn't the best example. Cheers!",
        "You really can't get over it, can't you? It is what it is and if you're pissed about paying 200 rs for a month and compare it as dick riding Reliance and Airtel then maybe yeah! I am endorsing for it! Inflation just works like that, Indian rupee is inflationary in nature and most things will lose value over time. Your income staying the same for for a very long is unfortunate and more or a \"personal issue\" and the world sadly cannot stop and bare the grunt, a public corporation would have least concerns for the same! \n\nI think I've repeated it countless times now things will start getting more and more expensive year over year! You can compare the prices for groceries and necessities like oil, gas, petrol/diesel, electricity, rent, housing in 90s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s and they will be radically different in every single era! Hell even pre-covid and post covid had a big jump in prices for a lot of things! \n\nPeople who absolutely cannot afford these plans are usually from rural areas who have the option to buy JioPhone and get 895 rs plan which has a validity of 336 days and JioBharat phone users have a plan for 1234 rs which is unchanged as of now, probably due to price sensitivity of these customers but that's just my speculation. \n\nWhen I gave the example of Steam I meant the constant price hikes that have happened with thousands of games over the past 2-3 years. Game prices have basically doubled or even trippled for some of the older games while newer games cost now cost 3499/4000/4299/5000 rs instead of 1299/2400/2999 like before. Wasn't talking about the sales and discounts! As a gamer I've gotta deal with it or move on.",
        "i think only jio allows plan queues",
        "Correct but that also due to favorable rules to both concerns multiple times. Example -\n\nhttps://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/news-analysis/how-ril-and-jio-raised-billions-without-paying-any-tax/article62198917.ece\n\nThat 'smart deal' was only for him, no one was given access to such a smart deal b4 or after.",
        "Reliance Industries got where it is with the help of Government favors and special deals and I get it but that isn't my point! \n\nI'm saying it's too little too late for BSNL. People in large numbers aren't going to disconnect their Jio or Airtel SIM cards infavor of BSNL. They've lost the battle a decade ago and there's no going back to the old glory days. \n\nI don't know about your state but BSNL has remained stagnant in terms of signal coverage for the last 15 years. Jio has covered nearly every major town, cities as well as rural area and they're actively investing in expanding their network throughout the country! \n\nBSNL is a shitty network with a shitty service. In Goa where I live if the electricity goes down, the entire BSNL network goes down with it and I'm not kidding! With 2024 and beyond everyone is moving towards 5G meanwhile BSNL is stuck with 3G and 4G and even then you get speeds of 5 - 20 mbps which is laughable. \n\nBSNL is good if you have a good coverage where you live and travel on regular basis or if you just want affordable plans, and if you got some old smartphone or don't need unlimited 5G.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Both Jio and Airtel have increased their tariff effective from July 3rd",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Source:",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "vodafone next.. If they wanted a modest return on capital, they shouldn't have been buying electoral bonds especially when they were making a loss all this while. And now that burden is being pushed on to consumers of their services, who are not left with any other choice due to the telecom industry becoming a duopoly lately. Fair enough man. I used more than 2 TB of 5G data on Jio’s 1559 yearly plan. At this point it feels guilty 🙃. They even removed some of the plans right now They were waiting for the election season to get over. They've discontinued the recharge of value plans like 395 because they don't want people to recharge in advance for unlimited 5G. Not everyone has a 5g capable phone. Tata should come up with 1 year free internet and cheapest plan for the next 3 years. Let the cockroaches pull each other down. You owe us Tata come on. Guys we can't reap the benefits of capitalism if we're not willing to accept the downsides. Destroyed BSNL and gave them access to their towers and look what happens. Electoral bonds was not an option for most companies (reliance Airtel aside) It was just unconstitutional hafta the government was collecting... either pay us or be hounded out of business Govt owns majority of VI and BSNL. They've already convinced bhakts these should be privatised. There would be firesale between Jio and Airtel who can form a cartel to split up both of these equally and then keep raising prices or degrading performance. Also keep getting government funding to Masterstroke. Ever dealth with bsnl? Yup. Pre 2014 it was not bad at all. They had good plans and I had no issues. Mate anyone sating bsnl were good is just lying through their teeth. You do you! The Karnataka circle of the BSNL was pretty chill. We faced no issues. In fact, we still have a couple of BSNL products. Nope. Not everywhere was BSNL bad. Some places it was even better than Airtel and other services. Obviously Jio wasn't a thing back then but still it was good. There's no more healthy competition in the market after 2014 tbh My mom used BSNL until 2020, and yes it wasn’t bad. At least in some regions. No 4G but back in the 3G days, it was the cheapest and you could call them up and get 50% discounts making it ultra cheap. That took a long time. They've been talking about this since Jio came out. Duopoly Capitalism benefits consumers only when there's competition. This is effectively a duopoly i.e. where consumers lose. Earlier we had options like Aircel if we're mobiledata heavy or BSNL if we wanted all India connectivity (just examples). Now we have no options. Only the illusion of choice. Both players are charging the same amount for roughly the same data. This might be an unpopular opinion, but they're businesses, for God's sake, and they'll be looking to raise revenue every now and then. They're not here to do social service for decades to come. The prices that Jio and Airtel (rather forcibly) offered for data to common citizens for years were unimaginably low if you compare the same with other countries. The fact that today every dude with a phone has a WhatsApp and Instagram installed on it, is primarily due to these companies. It's not like it'll not itch me to pay more for the same plans now, but I'd rather understand where it comes from. Sorry to say but I'm having to use BSNL in the current remote village of Rajasthan I'm in, because it's MILES better than the other private counterparts. We're paying somewhere around 1.1k for 300mbps no cap, the private vendors were charging 1.2k for 10mbps :) So no BSNL is not shit everywhere. I agree sometimes better options exist in Tier 1 and sometimes tier 2 cities also, but the situation I see here is very much in favour of BSNL And I cannot even do a recharge prematurely before 3rd July because then it will override my current recaharge. If I have validity of 6 months left and if I recharge for 1 year then my validity won't be 1.5 years but 1 years only. Happened with me. >And I cannot even do a recharge prematurely before 3rd July because then it will override my current recaharge AFAIK it won't override. Your new plan will start after the end of old plan I have a question, is 1.5gb/day annual recharge of jio same or increased ? The jio 1599 pack was actually discontinued. I am confused why they have listed it here. Maybe it’ll come back after the revisions. BSNL had the best rural coverage (atleast until around 2014) The 1559 one too. Mine is about to expire and I cannot find it. I wholeheartedly welcome this, i won't mind if they increase it to 50%. Ask me why. whats the 1559 plan? Wait a min Airtel too!??? Heading towards a duopoly If you have Jio then i dont think it will override. I've just recharged for a year and the plan will active after the current one ends. Use MyJio app to know more details. And my friends, this is called a duopoly and acting as a cartel. They need funds for the baby elephant's wedding. This used to be 349/month on Airtel back in 2021 or so when I lived in India. I am shocked that it has more than doubled since then. I had 15 days left on my plan. I did a 28 days recharge and my validity was 28 days on Airtel. Maybe it was a bug but it was a real one not just a visual one. I am not taking risks now Its okay, people voted for this shit BSNL was great for me too Recharge via agent asap. It comes from anti competitive practices which were highlighted in the CCI vs airtel case where jio was clearly engaging in predatory pricing however the court judged that jio is not a dominant player in the market hence we can't call it anti competitive behaviour (CCI vs bharti airtel 2016) But a duopoly formed now can be pinned on governments willingness to let jio engage in a price war *Guys we can't reap the benefits of capitalism if you're not willing to accept the downsides Fixed it for you Mr. Ambani You are funny ! 😂 Tata, how? Not surprised Why? >We have ensured that there is a very modest price increase (less than 70p per day) Lol what? They should have calculated per hour then it would have been less than 3p per hour. Per minute it would be less than 0.05p. Almost free! Lol why? Should not be a surprise What?? It was showing up yesterday night. How? Yes have been using BSNL since eternity. Mi first sim and primary as well. I know it sounds unfair and I'm definitely not defending the misuse of monopolies, but in the face of neutered policies and a price sensitive population, this was always coming. Welcome to late stage capitalism 101. Nope. Here it is in writing. 5G browsing between 12 am to 6 am is free on my totally basic Vi plan. They are honestly single-handedly preventing us from becoming victims of the monopoly Jio sought to create with its predatory pricing and regulatory favours, and it is now reversing that. Probably to pay for the big fat wedding as others have said. Number portability is easy now. Switch if quality matters to you. Otherwise I think Jio cannot risk not being the cheapest. Tata is not going to come to anybody’s rescue here btw. Where's the 666 plan? Exactly what a few of us predicted back when. Just like RAILNET got ruined, BSNL got ruined, free internet unlimited at most railway stations ns got ruined. Welcome to ram rajya and acche din. I remember the days when my grandparents didn't have to recharge with a single rupee as incoming was always present while outgoing charged. Then came 2014 and everything started getting charged lifetime validity recharge went into the toilet. Now no more lifetime validity. No more nothing. ,eanwhile tata 207 is blowing cash out the wazooo. BSNL could/would have been a China Mobile or Verizon level huge, instead it's 50X smaller than them. Well deserved 👏👏. Those who sow the wind, shall reap the whirlwind. everyone back to BSNL🏃 I still use BSNL 😂😭 Sasta hai! Data chori nahi hota They should increase it much more so that the people realize exactly what is going on. Aur bolo jio Dan Dana Dan. New year offer. Players eliminate karke, supplier favouring market kar dia I knew jio would take over and make our lives miserable when 10 years ago they were handing out free sim cards with accessible internet for low price. I'm shocked it actually took so long. How? Literally said [the exact same thing](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1dpsojb/reliance_jio_hiked_plans_by_2025/lakitdh/) yesterday. Is there ANY plan/telecom left right now that gives you cheap incoming and outgoing and maybe 100-200 Mb data for many days? Most of my time is spent in a Wifi environment so I don't need mobile data It's not and I'm tired of pretending. I hope voters learn that overnight international airport, destination wedding including pree and post celebration for months, international celebrities in wedding Sangeet don't pay by themselves. If you think Tata is a friend of the people, then you should stop going on LinkedIn. They are just as selfish as any other megacorp, just better PR Happened with me as well. The override happens if you have limited data like 6gb for 84 days, then if you recharge with daily data limit. It's called inflation. If someone is curious this is what cartel pricing looks like. Yup Vi for the win VI🙂‍↔️ Is Mittal your father? Because he can pay for our recharge too Am I right? \"there is COMPITISUN in free market\" sob moho maya... coordinate kore price barache... We have to fund ambani and mittal's next mega yacht ! Kya benefit mila tujhe BSNL for now. ₹107 for 35 days gives 200 min calls and 3 Gb data. u/Charged_Dreamer happy? I'm sorry, who are you and what's the context? Apun kya karne ka.. can't avoid paying whatever the price they are quoting.. just gonna curse and then continue to pay Im the guy you were writing those walls of texts to supporting JIO and what came after. This post mentions the price hike thats arrived to due the duopoly of these companies. Feel free to read the rest of the comments. ehh. IMO VI is more or less the same as everything else. Same pricing too. I simply switched to BSNL. only available for Satan. i for sure, did. never would buy a jio sim but alteast they dont cut off incomming unlike the other two I don't think of Tata as a friend, how can I when I worked with Tata for 3 years. Just that they can jump in that war for ISPs and take down Jio. And I know about their BS PR. BSNL is in different league for recharge prices. but very unreliable Im on the same boat. I went to BSNL. prepaid is still better , me as postpaid user will be more impacted bcs first the tarrif hike then the fucking gst will added into this hiked prices. Areee just copium. They are the ones who can do it. its getting better little by little and certainly fits my use case Oh it is you! You really got butthurt with the comments and took it personally, didn't you? Must have felt the burn I guess. Anyways, if you think you can waste my time then go ahead, I have all the time in the world to waste. Now with that out of the way back to business. Am I happy with the price hike? You bet I am not bit am I pissed about it? Not at all considering the price hike came after like 2.5 years. I understand the inflation exists and Indian economy is inflationary in nature and prices for goods and services do not remain the same. As for my previous point, literally nothing has changed! There is still 198 rs plan with unlimited calling for 28 days and this plan is for people like you that do not want lots of data and extra benefits. That is 2x then what you paid for pre Jio days in 2015 and I'd once again repeat I'd rather pay 350 rs for 56GB of data i.e 2GB/day with unlimited 5G (no data caps) then pay 1024MB data for the same price with calling, SMS charged. We have been over this like multiple times now. As a gamer I deal with price hikes every single year on platforms like Steam and this is no different. If you want cheap plans they still exist for you at 200 rs even today. This is fine. Data here is exceptionally cheap already. Ain't nobody (in hyperbole) moving to 3G and 4G when everyone is buying or upgrading to 5G handsets in 2024. If BSNL wants to compete they'll have to massively do better than competition to upgrade to 5G. It took BSNL a decade to switch to 4G when Airtel, Vodafone and Idea were doing it back in 2014-2015. While BSNL can technically survive indefinitely with tax payer money they cannot thrive with that money alone and considering their mountain of debt, huge losses year-on-year for nearly a decade, outdated infrastructure, Government fucking it up everytime. most people are going to upgrade their phones eventually in 2024/25 and beyond. As far as I can tell 4G phones are not being mass produced anymore in 2024. Most flagships post 2020 should have 5G support and nearly every midrange phone released post 2023 with now budget phones selling for less than 15k Man, our full country used mobile internet for free for some time and then at pretty cheap rates. Of course we all knew that this is a common user base capture tactic to kill competition and soon they would jack up prices once they were a monopoly. I'm just wondering why everyone is acting surprised now. As if Ambani will be broken without hiking these prices. 5g browsing on vi? Does Airtel have any unlimited 5G plans? >I remember the days when my grandparents didn't have to recharge with a single rupee as incoming was always present while outgoing charged. Then you may also remember when incoming was also charged. Or when we have to cut calls quickly, so that we don't extend the call by a sec which would have increased the price by a rupee. You may have also remembered standing in long queue in post office to recharge the internet. >Then came 2014 and everything started getting charged lifetime validity recharge went into the toilet. Now no more lifetime validity. No more nothing. This is market dynamics at play. Duopoly or monopoly is bad for the consumers. Since, they are the only providers they can afford to increase the price, unless some newcomers come to undercut them. Same is the case with uber, Zomato etc. But there was a huge reduction in the cost of the internet though. It's not like we didn't benefit. Most people are not buying flagships. They don't have that kind of money. Many brands have a 4G version of a phone which is cheaper than the 5G one. Delulu is not the solulu. I know most people dont have that kind of money and I used flagship as an example for 2020 and 2021 phones! You can literally get 5G phones for less than 15000 rs with 6GB RAM, 90hz refresh rate screens, fast charging in 2024. Going forward people are eventually going to upgrade their phones or buy a new phone in 2024 or next year. Don't be an ignorant fool. 91mobiles.com/list-of-phones/best-budget-5g-phones 4G smartphones are a thing of past and like 3G smartphones that came before 2016. It was a matter of time before 3G phones went out of existence in 2016-17. Even if they somehow buy 5G phones, they'll be forced to use a 4g network because of pricing. The freebie has to end someday. Fr. They could have been the SBI of the telecom sector. VI announced tariff increase now. Seems to be a ctrl+c ctrl+v job of Airtel. Go to nearby jio store or recharge shop. They will do it. Holy shit!! I just found out it's true lol....should have recharged yesterday. Does anyone know how to recharge this 395 plan asap? bada diya bhai ab paise jutane hai agle recharge ke liye 5g hai hi nhi vi mai All the Cruise party expenses now are being covered with one strike. bsnl apni services achi kar le to uspe port hone ka option khul jayega....bohot log to switch bhi kar rahe Acha Din Vi did the same too This sucks man Are you sure it works? Can we do multiple recharges to keep them in the pipeline? Looks like people have forgotten that Tata did use to have a telecom company called Tata DoCoMo, which is now merged with Airtel. Although their plans used to be cheap, but Ive had horrible nightmares with their service and customer support. They were very anti-consumer as is with other Tata brands. Never liked any Tata brand as a customer. Which plan did you recharge? But it's available for vampires like me as well I had very bad experience with bsnl.. in the past..not going back there..when it t starTed it was good.. Cant tell about queue. Maybe agent know better. That's fun. I have 2 sims. Airtel and Jio. I'm on the hook for twice as much payment than normal user Cheapest plans for a year. You pay only for Data if you use it. Since everyone has wifi at home. They are increasing base prices so that we have to pay ₹199 (and ₹299 soon as per ARPU targets) just to keep the phone alive on the network. The poor and middle class will have jard time to deal with this considering everyone in the family uses the mobile phones now. Ab aise toh tum bol do ki 99s mein 14 outgoing 7 incoming lagta tha. Kuch bhi. Bhai main bhi metro mein hi rehta tha aur hun. Post office mein separate counter hota tha uske liye and mere ghar ke paas do they and I never had to stand behind more than 4-5 people on any given day. Btw this applied to BSNL for those who don't know. Kai jagahon pe 3rd party ko de dia tha BSNL ne and they used to come collect from 09 onwards in Calcutta. In my area there wasn't 3rd party so I hadto submit. They also had deposit service where you could deposit earn interest and bills would automatically get debited. Bsnl and india post became kings of their segments 09 onwards in most states. In rural area of Bengal I remember each village used to have sub post offices run from 10am to 3pm . This was in 2013 near haldia town. We used to get online shopping deliveries via india post till I think 2016 thereafter Amazon and others started using AWS delhibery etc in our villages. Just did it few days back, it is in last tab in jio app. Both the companies are taking customers for ride.... Unfortunately a very few choices left. I too have used Docomo. I have even used Indicom the oldest telecom service by tata. In a year? I have used 725GB in Vi in a month only in 12AM to 6 Am Kyuki yeh log Baraatiyon ka swagat paan parag se krna chahte hain🙏 budget toh badhana padhenga. And common man will pay for mota bhais wedding :) >Ab aise toh tum bol do ki 99s mein 14 outgoing 7 incoming lagta tha. >Kuch bhi. Bhai tu hi past ki baat kar raha tha pahle. As I said, airtel & jio have duopoly they can afford to increase the price. Unless some new player comes with a lower price and better offers, this won't change. Also, this is not unique to India. It happens in other countries too like US. You can look at the how uber & Zomato are working nowadays compared to when they were launched. They increased the price once they dominated the market. That's the reality, it doesn't matter which government is in power. Unless the government takes the socialist route and again starts nationalizing these companies. Since when is breaking up trade cartels socialism. And govt doesn't need to breakup cartels. Here govt isn't letting anyone survive except the chosen blessed ones. That's not a free market that's crony capitalism. And kindly don't compare Indian domestic market to murican domestic market. These are two very different animals. >Since when is breaking up trade cartels socialism. And which government will break it? Rich pays to all parties. If gov change, they will pay new ones. That's how it's working. >Here govt isn't letting anyone survive except the chosen blessed ones. Most of the competition went under because of cheap plans given by jio initially to capture the market. Ambani has a huge income stream from the petro business with which he could sustain the initial losses, but companies couldn't. Also, Vodafone went under because of retro tax put on them by gov. This was a double blow to it, they needed to cut the plan cost to survive & pay huge tax to gov. This was done by pranab when he was finance minister. Few years back gov did try to save it, by rolling back retro tax & giving some aid. That's why Vodafone is still operation but is now a small player. You can argue on bsnl, but it would have lost market share because of shit customer service & bad management. >Here govt isn't letting anyone survive except the chosen blessed ones You can say it for cases like leasing/selling ports/airport to adani etc. and I will totally agree. But this telecom is not the same case as gov tenders. Ambani had the capital to capture the market & he did, it would have been the same regardless of who is in the gov. >Since when is breaking up trade cartels socialism. It's not socialism. But sadly monopolies are a global problem. Then why are the people celebrating and being happy, and a false facade of being proud of a capitalist fat piggy's wealth jerkoff all over the internet. I don't see an iota of common sense in the words like \"india is not poor\" in the comment boxes, india is very poor and has a growing economic imbalance and i am afraid nobody is speaking up for it. These pigs need to be taxed, else india will never achieve equality Dont insult elephants they dont hoard resources which could be enough to feed 1 million people a day. Dont quote me on the maths, but it must be close How's the network compared to Airtel etc It's good for calls and messages. I've been using it as my secondary SIM for a long time and while there used to be issues with delayed OTPs and call dropping, that is no longer the case. I even get network while traveling through remote places where my primary (Jio) doesn't get a signal. But it's doshit for internet. They still use 3G in most places and have just started installing 4G towers recently. I can somehow get working internet at home (Bangalore) but it is unusably slow at some places. Yearly 3k wala The long game is to milk you and your children for decades so that they and their children live like kings. Yet here you are being thankful for 4-5 years of cheap data. That 'debt' has been made on BSNL. People have very short memories. Before jio came, all the frequencies for mobile were with BSNL. when jio & airtel came in, they were told to let go of the frequencies & they will get frequency allocations in all bands at subsidized rates. Obviously, the government didn't keep it promises & even tenders were delayed & whatnot to destroy BSNL. You do not have to believe me, just go to any BSNL office, be friends with them, take them out for a cup of tea or whatever, they will tell you many more horror stories than what I shared. Just imagine, a tender happens, a vendor wins, BSNL pays amount & the vendor delays supplying the equipment. That interest has to be borne by BSNL. That's just one example of how BSNL's debts are so high. Another thing to note, all the employees of BSNL are not of BSNL but on deputation from DOT. Bring Back BSNL So we are doing body shaming now... > Just like RAILNET got ruined It's been years since I've been to a railway station, could you please tell me more? I recall that many years back there was free wifi at some of the railway stations (I think Google partnered to offer this). That's no longer a thing? Why? Need old recharge systems where we were not forced to pay monthly Jio has ruined everything Earlier there were so many companies competetion was healthy not its monopoly of jio If I recharge the 666 plan on myjio app , will it be added to the queue and start after my current plan ends . Also will I get the 5g unlimited ? Rip my 839 airtel plan Vi - I'm still alive!!!! Careful what you wish for especially with SBI. Can't blame them. They're under high distress and have to follow suite. yeah but in the 12am-6am, vi gives free unlimited data if your plan has the benefit ig that is what he is talking about Even before Jio's lauch, I remember BSNL lacking services for 4G while Airtel, Vodafone and Idea offered them in some circles so I'm not really sure about BSNL ever having all the frequencies (LTE, 4G). BSNL however offered significantly cheaper 3G plans compared to the rest 3 big players. Government screwing up BSNL was no secret but at the same time BSNL suffered from legacy issues. Some of my friends had headache dealing with BSNL as their service was completely incompetent here in Goa and the employees acted like they were the Kings. Taking a simple broadband connection would take weeks and require multiple follow-ups and landline connection charges were also forced before they moved to fiber. When disconnection happened internet used to be frequently down for multiple days with no compensation for lost days unless you write physical letter and manually send it to BSNL offices. Regardless of how they got this huge debt it does not matter what caused it now. It does not matter anymore. The truth is BSNL cannot directly compete with Airtel and Jio. If they could you wouldn't be seeing so slow adoption of 4G services. Forget about growth they should be more worried about just keeping the existing customers happy as the mounting losses continue and total outstanding debt is also ballooning. Do I think BSNL will go bust? Probably not as long as taxpayer money and cash infusion keeps it running and employees keep getting their salaries timely. I just don't think they're going to have 5G internet services ready in before the next decade starts and these guys had 4G in 2020s when the competition had it since 2014-15. For comparison BSNL has just 7.5% marketshare as of 2024 and Vi with 18%. Both have been consistently losing marketshare since 2016 and are currently at rock bottom. Only Airtel (33%) and Jio (40%) are getting net gains in most quarters. Internet was always a luxury. Now that tarrifs have increased we'll have less stupid people on the internet opiniating for sheit stuff. We'll have less people on quora asking \"I have 98LPA is it enough to survive in Bangalore \", less people on indiaTech subreddit asking for next phone or laptop suggestions for their generic requirement and less folks asking how to become a generic software engineer from a person who is in his infancy stages of education on developersindia subreddit. 0 crap and 100% real issues and opinions. Butthurt? How old do you think I am lol Bro look, I cannot change your mind and neither can you change mine. As for inflation, the biggest brunt of it is delivered to the end consumer which is us. Now if you want to dickr-ride big corpos sucking the life out of the common peoples then please make all the noise you can about inflation. Inflation doesn't only mean unlimited price hikes til the end of time, our incomes have stayed the same for the longest time as well which makes these price hikes unfair. Hey, I game too and steam is quite lenient with sales every now & then and even with the biggest titles you'd get stuff like 50-40% off and steam quite honestly isn't the best example. Cheers! You really can't get over it, can't you? It is what it is and if you're pissed about paying 200 rs for a month and compare it as dick riding Reliance and Airtel then maybe yeah! I am endorsing for it! Inflation just works like that, Indian rupee is inflationary in nature and most things will lose value over time. Your income staying the same for for a very long is unfortunate and more or a \"personal issue\" and the world sadly cannot stop and bare the grunt, a public corporation would have least concerns for the same! I think I've repeated it countless times now things will start getting more and more expensive year over year! You can compare the prices for groceries and necessities like oil, gas, petrol/diesel, electricity, rent, housing in 90s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s and they will be radically different in every single era! Hell even pre-covid and post covid had a big jump in prices for a lot of things! People who absolutely cannot afford these plans are usually from rural areas who have the option to buy JioPhone and get 895 rs plan which has a validity of 336 days and JioBharat phone users have a plan for 1234 rs which is unchanged as of now, probably due to price sensitivity of these customers but that's just my speculation. When I gave the example of Steam I meant the constant price hikes that have happened with thousands of games over the past 2-3 years. Game prices have basically doubled or even trippled for some of the older games while newer games cost now cost 3499/4000/4299/5000 rs instead of 1299/2400/2999 like before. Wasn't talking about the sales and discounts! As a gamer I've gotta deal with it or move on. i think only jio allows plan queues Correct but that also due to favorable rules to both concerns multiple times. Example - That 'smart deal' was only for him, no one was given access to such a smart deal b4 or after. Reliance Industries got where it is with the help of Government favors and special deals and I get it but that isn't my point! I'm saying it's too little too late for BSNL. People in large numbers aren't going to disconnect their Jio or Airtel SIM cards infavor of BSNL. They've lost the battle a decade ago and there's no going back to the old glory days. I don't know about your state but BSNL has remained stagnant in terms of signal coverage for the last 15 years. Jio has covered nearly every major town, cities as well as rural area and they're actively investing in expanding their network throughout the country! BSNL is a shitty network with a shitty service. In Goa where I live if the electricity goes down, the entire BSNL network goes down with it and I'm not kidding! With 2024 and beyond everyone is moving towards 5G meanwhile BSNL is stuck with 3G and 4G and even then you get speeds of 5 - 20 mbps which is laughable. BSNL is good if you have a good coverage where you live and travel on regular basis or if you just want affordable plans, and if you got some old smartphone or don't need unlimited 5G. hey were you able to? hey were you able to? nope"
