Scammers who know what they're doing dont use the same upi id to scam tens of thousands of people. No. At best, they're scamming 10 people before their account comes under scrutiny. Also, I think 500-1000 scam has almost the same jail time if done to multiple people, but the payout is far less. With amounts like 15k or 10k scammed from 10 people. They have an easy 1 to 1.5 lakh and repeating this process multiple times before they're caught guarantees them a lenient sentence because they have the money to get out of it. Its not like law will force them to pay it when there's no way to make them pay. If banks couldn't recover money from mallya , do you think they can even get an old 1000rs note from babu chhapri?",

        "Mujhe dede bhai nhi chiye toh 😭😭",
        "bro what if some uncle sent you by mistake??\n\nThe upi transactions are irreversible so they can't send reverse request to their bank.\n\ntell your bank about it maybe they can trace where the money came from. if it doesnt work maybe take it to cyber police. after all if you've found a wallet on road you would try to return it to police.",
        "Thanks, didn't knew it was possible.",
        "What happens if you just refuse to send it back?",
        "Elections are near it seems 😂",
        "No idea....\n\nAbout 26 years ago, I got an amount in the equivalent of Rs 45,000 in my account. My salary was around the same amount. I withdrew part of the amount from the bank. Unbeknownst to me, a couple of days later, my salary came in. When I withdrew some more cash, I saw the excess. Those days, we did not have sms facility. \n\nI took a mini statement and noticed the earlier credit was not my salary and informed the bank. \n\nThe guy at the customer service did not want to admit their mistake initially but after a few days, the amount was reversed. \n\nI always wondered what would have happened if I did not report this to the bank. I know, I would have lived in fear if I used the money.",

        "I cannot believe this has 400+ upvotes.\n\nI call bullshit. No UPI provider, or even the bank in question has the power of debiting the amount back from your account and \"reversing\" the transaction.\n\nWhat you have mentioned ONLY APPLIES ON CREDIT CARDS, and NOT on UPI.\n\nIn UPI, once the amount is received, it's YOURS. There is no escrow in between and there is no scope of reversibility.",
        "Exactly this! That person is spreading so much bullshit and people here are trusting him. This could put someone who genuinely sent money to the wrong person in distress.",

        "The payment is from PhonePe and it's their generic payouts VPA. But I see 3 possibilities:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. You got a refund / credit from wallet to bank (If you're sure you didn't pay out anyone in recent times, then this rules out).\n2. Someone was trying to pay rent via CC and paid you by mistake (I'm not sure if the rental payouts go through this VPA, have to cross check).\n3. Some scammer has carded and sent you the payment to later request you to send it back to their other account which basically is money laundering, so when the actual CC holder disputes, you end up losing money since the bank will put a hold on your account while you've already lost the 15k. Meanwhile the scammer has siphoned off the stolen funds from someone via you. Victim = You. Total damage = 15k.",
        "Wow the amount of bullshit you can pull out of your ass is astonishing. What exactly do you think happens if someone reports an accidental transaction to a bank? Do you think the bank just returns the money? \n\nPeople like you are the worst kind of scum. Because of you someone who genuinely made a mistake will go through hell and at the same time no real scam will be avoided since there IS NO SCAM that works like this.",
        "And what exactly do you think will happen if the op receives the call? Well the person bite his ear through the phone?

    "light_cleaned_title": "Randomly received money on UPI",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "So I randomly received 15k from this UPI ID. Is this some sort of scam or fraud? How should I proceed with this? What are your views on this?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "2 zeroes are missing. Modiji promised 15 lakhs. Shortly you will get a call for this Don't fall for this, it's a scam. And by no chance return the money or else your account details will be shared with the scammer and you lose more money. Aise Problems toh sabko de bhagwan! Someone must have mistyped the digits of the phone number/UPI ID. You may wanna consider sending the money back to the same number/UPI ID. Think about the other person. They could be from a lower income group and maybe sending the amount for something important. Verify that the amount has indeed been reflected in your bank account and then send it back. Withdraw and keep in hand ask them to cone in person if they really want it 😂 Aj toh party hai bhai Best solution 👍 Mudijee sent you the first instalment of promised 15 lakhs. Cherish it or else you would have to buy electoral bonds It's definitely not a mistake, because the upi id is phonepe-payouts, so it's either an official payout from phonepe or some scammer using the custom upi id feature. How exactly is someone going to withdraw money by just UPI ID? Nice That's what I've been thinking but is it possible to spoof your UPI ID like this? That's the way, I am not sure if you have read recent news/events. You can withdraw money using UPI at ATM's, and understanding the way scammers are working these days, everything is available at hand and when you share details you are always one step away from getting duped. Yes it's possible, but it's not spoofing. It's a feature anyone can use. You still need their phone physically to do anything on top of that you need their phone password on top of that you need their UPI Pin. Just read about it recently in a sub, dont send the money back, they need to contact their bank and then your bank will contact you then only you should return it only out of goodwill!! Your bank won't tell you to UPI them back, they would ask for a cheque or something, your account could could get blocked if you send the money back. I firmly believe that you lack digital literacy. Bhai mujhe 6000 dede pls ek garib ka bhala ho jayga I believe the same about you Chances are you will get a call saying they sent it to your number by mistake...and to send it back to them. DO NOT DO THIS!!! They might give you a sob sorry and then might threaten you. DO NOT SUCCUMB TO THIS!!! The best way to tackle the situation is to report it to your bank, and if they want to withdraw the money, their bank should contact your bank. Scammers have been using this technique for the longest time. 15 lakhs dena tha, Modi ji doing kanjoosi Plus there are tons of posts on quora where people have been scammed. Well, I also believe you are more on that side where, you'd believe it when it happens to you.. Don't receive calls from unknown numbers. If you do end up getting a call about the money, #do not in any shap or for follow their instructions. Bank Name is automatically used when you create a UPI address after linking to a debit card / bank account. It's a tough nut to crack, especially getting such a name registered itself would be difficult. My bet is either OP received a long forgotten refund, or a bug somewhere that was sent to OP's ID instead of someone else's. Please read my comment bro... This technique has been used by scammers. My brother had his account wiped out with a similar situation. No organisation is a fool to have such weird payment payout, plus their accounts department would be questioned for such insane payouts. It's surely a scam People who get scammed are absolute dumbfucks who are not able to even read that the next person on the phone has requested money not sending money and entering their UPI PIN willingly and don't even know that you don't need to enter UPI PIN to receive money. In order to send money to someone there are a couple of things that you need - 1. Number/ID/account of the person 2. Amount that you are sending 3. OTP How scam works - They will make the person send xyz money to the scammers account and make the person share the OTP to complete the transaction. How OP can make sure they don't get scammed - 1.Enter the UPI ID from which they have received this amount 2. Enter exactly the amount the they received erroneously. 3. Enter the OTP to complete this transaction. 4. Once this transaction is completed then avoid all further transactions. People who get scammed are dumb and not everything is a scam. \\*Income tax department, CBI enters the chat\\* What happens if they send it back? Bhai kisi bechare ne galti se bhej dia hoga. Rukja kuchh din wo khud ya fir bank contact krega tujhe waapis dedena usko . (I'm assuming it's not a scam) Not really. You can have anything as your UPI id. Mine is my nickname. Yes after @ it's the address of the platform I am using. Like ybl for phonepe or @paytm for Paytm. But the main id can be anything which is unique. Acche din aa gaye tumhare Bhai mujhe 4000 dede pls ek garib ka bhala ho jayga Withdraw the money then deactivate the upi id and be happy 😀 Banks can put a hold onto this if the person who transferred reports jt Edit: I don't intend to keep this money and I highly suspect that it's a scam after reading all your comments. I think I'm just gonna contact my bank and ask them if they can revert this ammount back to whoever who originally sent it because if I do it manually I may get into trouble. What do you guys think? Yeah I want to know as well. How do scammers profit from this to and fro motion If they have recived money in there account, that means whoever have sent the money already has the account details, isnt it? Best idea. Don’t get involved. Let your bank know and let them handle it. No. Digitisation has happened rapidly and it is hard for everyone to keep up, specially old people. You should be a bit empathetic instead of calling them dumbfuks. Muje 14000 Dede garib ka bhala hoga Modi ji 15 lakh dhire dhire bhej rhe hai. Bhai mujhw bacha kucha dedo Contact your bank, don't UPI that money back. Stay alert, stay safe. Once you try to send it back, your entire Savings balance will be gone as if it never existed. Party 🎉 Do not pay it back. It's a scam I am not sure if anyone here has come across a scam process where a lady will reach out to you saying, 'we are giving you a freelancer job, where you just need to do simple tasks like subscribe to a YouTube channel or something and they will give you some 50 bucks per subscribe, and it's easy to fall for this because you will recieve money(genuinely) and once you are convinced, the tasks they share will be more in groups and here in group tasks they will ask you to either pay them 2K or 5K basis the task, and being already convinced you'd do it, that's human pysche, and there the actual game starts of duping you of lacs of yours hard earned money. This has been quite on the news lately and unfortunately one of my friends lost around 1.5L too. Bhai uss bache kuche paise se mujge party dedo How is that even possible? You got it....scammers scam people who are 'dumb' or least expect. That the reason sms sent by scammers have obvious grammatical errors. Happened to me when someone gave my UPI id when asking for a refund on Flipkart. Payment was similar to this from a official UPI id of saying phonepe Ask the Scammer maybe? I also agree, 'not everything is a scam'....my point is, why take a risk. Its best to go the proper way.... Prevention is better than cure, isn't it? So if it is withdrawn, would the possible scammer be out of money because they can simply ask for a refund from phonepe as far as i am aware.isnt that the whole scam, they ask you to send the money back and then even put in request for refund. Asking them to contact phonepe directly would be a better option. It's usually not as simple as sending it back....I wish I knew their modus operandi. Just enjoy They put in a request for a refund with the upi they used, claiming they sent the money to the wrong id before they call you. Once their refund request is accepted, they will call the victim and ask them for the money to be returned. If the person returns the money, the upi app registers it as the victim sending scammer money and not returning it, and by the time the victim realises this, the scammer deletes the id and everything related. They can get access to everything from burner phones to stolen aadhar numbers of real people. Be careful of scammers. I've heard they call you and try to get their money back from your account. When you return the money, I recommend doing a demand draft or something so that they don't get your account number. I have been reading about this scam on reddit in various subs. I got such a message on telegram and I immediately blocked them. I read somewhere that people who received even small amount of money from them got their accounts freezed if someone else complained and investigation has started. So it's quite risky to even entertain them to get few bucks. Exactly, plus they operate through telegram, and the upi's which are I believe time bound or something which cease to exists after 10-15 mins. Plus it's hard to track through UPI unless it's legit. When my friend shared the name of upi's on which he sent money, the upi's were like farooq@freecharge and something similar.so it's hard for even the cyber cell to track these Only issue is that what if its a genuine case but in this day and age caution is everything... Yes phone pe option is a good one, to bring their attention to this Send 6969 asap. I have to buy some important things Mujhe ek burger khila uncle ji Bhai usse bacha(🧒) aur kucha dono dedo, lekin paise mujhe he dena Yes...sabko Milne wala h 15 lakh...100 installments of 15k Scammers are evolving day by day. With new technology, they are find new ways to scam people. So what happens is that the scammer sends you money on one UPI ID and then asks you to return money on another. In this way, they try to launder stolen money through you. Bhai mujhe 15rs dede ek cig hojayegi Chhi ganda nabalik bacha 15 ki cig pita he, 20 wali pio better rahegi Empty your bank account fast as it might get frozen if it's scamming money. Were you a Flipkart employee? It could be a scam like others mentioned, but mannn just last month my friend sent their fees to a coffee shop by mistake instead of their friend to withdraw and pay to the college. Ofc, we went and met them personally and showed them the payment proof before we requested them to pay it back to us. So it could be a payment done by mistake... but yeah scam is a larger possibility here. Um No, Why did you ask? Remove all of your money from that account in cash. Except for that 15k. Stop using your same account for any kind of transactions. DO NOT USE YOUR SAME ACCOUNT FOR ANY TRANSACTION FROM HEREON UNTILL YOU ARE IN THE CLRAR. File an official complaint either in the nearest police station or cyber crime station. Anytime in the future if anyone contacts you for this then show them photocoy of the complaint. Do not under any circumstances send money via UPI or electronic mode. Do not entertain any request to return money in person. Ask them to come to police station where you have filed complaint and there only carry any transaction if you want to otherwise you are not entitled to return the money. Problems you may face after this Your bank account may get debit blocked or frozen because a complaint may get filed against you in some remote police station. At the time you need to dig email ID for the remote police station and their senior officials till very top Send an email to that police station about what has happened and send a copy of the complaint you have filed. Cc every senior official in the sent email. dont do anything or send to others . Everything will be resolved automatically Wo 15 lakh ka installment h kya? Sabke sath hoga toh kisika bhala nhi hoga Thk bhai 20rs marde pilunga Saw a similar scam on yt regarding pay pal the scammer pays u lot of money then calls saying pls return it back and before calling u they have called the bank itself to register a complaint to get the money back they sent by mistake. Unaware u feels sorry and sends the money back. Now in this case if u send it back you'll lose double the money because the bank will also take out money from ur acc and send to theirs. *throws 20rs like mudiji throwing 15L* It's totally refund, Because phonepe-payout@yesbank is the registered upi id of Phonepe & I cross checked with NSDL, Its linked with phonepe. It's totally refund, Because phonepe-payout@yesbank is the registered upi id of Phonepe & I cross checked with NSDL, Its linked with phonepe. Return it Understandable OP, don't fall for this. This guy is still going to extort the garib after getting 6000 from you. /s Wait I'm not understanding how this could be a scam? Few of the comments say if we return the amount to that mobile number, we'll get scammed? How does the scam????? They probably will send you a qr. on scanning that qr money would be deducted from your account. They already set the amount to be deducted and that qr scanning confirms the transaction. I might be wrong but thats what i have heard **Sabke SATH Sabka VIKAAS!** **Har kisiko ₹15K** milenge tabhi toh India banega **$5 Trillion** Economy! It's mine, I sent by mistake. please return to me :( he just did. Hahahahahahahahahha That's the usual scams people fall for when they don't have any idea on what they are doing, but here since they already have the UPI I'd, and received 15K from that account, if they just send it back this scam doesn't work. Someone clarified in one of the replies that they might report in the UPI app for refund, that kind of scan is possible Don't resend it it's a scam If I am understanding correctly, the scammer requests to return the money on different UPI ID and system flags it as the receiver is sending money to some of his other account. The scammer will get official return of the money from the bank plus the money which he received from the victim which he unofficially requested. Is it correct? God me when Bhai maine hi bheje the galti se. Savita bhabhi ko bhej raha tha. Wapas kar diyo pls uwu instead of paying them thjrough UPI try to pay them in person 5 toh ho hi jaigi ab 10 ye zada bolo It's likely a scam, you can face life imprisonment if you keep that money. Just send it to me I'll deal with it Bahi 500 Dede. Next month 600 le Leo. This is the first emi from the 15 lakhs promised in 2014. It says lhonepe pvtltd most probably someone opted out for payment through credit for bills or rent or fees . Two possibilities 1) someone has entered the wrong phone number while paying out through the credit card on the phonepe but it will ask to confirm upiid and name So a scammer Who will call you ask you money back and will issue in phone pe for refund and he may get refunded but phonepe will ask you to payback the amount If he calls just ask him to raise the issue at phonepe and get refunded from there I didn't know upi had refund requests I think this is installment of those 1.5 lac that were promised in 2014. Oh sorry , it got sent by me ...can you send it back😉😉 Oh I sent that by mistake please return my money back op. Beta ek din aisa aayega jab **Rothschild** se jyada **₹₹₹₹₹₹** apne **INDIA** ke paas hoga! Yes contacting bank would be best solution Everybody profits from a to and fro motion r/expectedcommunism Never send the money back ... Ask them to contact their bank for a reversal if you don't want to lose your money Never do that so they will ask the bank to refund the money even if they gave the money by cash there's no proof Just get your bank involved do not send money personally in this situation. No matter what happens. And don’t maintain any contact with these people. Don't spend it 200% cashback for the scammer. They will initiate a request through the proper channels i.e. bank. You might need to approve it, I'm not sure. And then they ask you to send the money back. They will give a sob story about how they need the money now and the bank is taking too much time. That's good idea. Hire some local goons and call the scammer to come to your place. Then thrash them saying, How will a normal person lead a good life with this small money and demand them extra 50K. Give the 10K to goons and take the rest. Easy money 🤑 Why does the scammer have the need to send a big amount like 15k though? Can't they just send like 500-1000 and it would have the same effect Maybe first instalment of 15 lakhs we were promised in 2014 You definitely have a business idea here, albeit an illegal one 😂 become robin hood. slide me some 15 lakh ki first installment aayi hai bro. Congratulations! 15 lakh ka phele instalment aya probably 🫥🤣 Vo nahi pata Jawaan movie ne kisi ko influence kar diya hai shayad /s It was supposed to be 15 lakhs from the black money stashed abroad. This is the test remittance. Net remittance will be for 14,85,000 so that the account is squared off :-) Modiji finally delivering the promised PM care fund for the people. Long live Mudiji. Moody forever. Almost correct, but there is no second upi id. It is the same id. Just the bank doesn’t know that the victim is “refunding” the money. As far as the bank is concerned you are just sending him money. It's not spoofing. That's his UPI ID. I had an option to create a custom UPI ID when registering on me bank's UPI app. 14,85,000 ana abhi baki par modi ji to 15 lakh bhejne bale thai... Bruhh. 😂. This business idea gives good returns if you are a big shot. If not you'll get a butt shot from the police. You got 1st instalment of 15L. Congrats! Hey bro, that's my money that I mistakenly sent you. Please send it back to me ASAP. /sarcasm Looks like this scam: [Bank A/Cs can be frozen for no fault of yours: What UPI users learned in Kerala](https://www.thenewsminute.com/kerala/bank-acs-can-be-frozen-no-fault-yours-what-upi-users-learned-kerala-175940) Gist of the scam: * Your account gets money deposited through UPI from unknown number. * Police freeze **your** account due to involvement in suspicious money transfer. * Police will harass **you** for a bribe to unfreeze your account. (YES) * Bank personnel will *advice* you to just pay up. At least inform your bank about this suspicious transfer as soon as possible. OP pls check this, you can get in trouble. Your bank account can get frozen. Give me 2000 onli Paise withdraw karke phone band kardo 2-3 din ke liye, sab theek ho jayega Although some scammers do scam from smaller amounts but it is only because they're new and aren't aware that they'll have to buy new credentials which dont come cheap. Scammers who know what they're doing dont use the same upi id to scam tens of thousands of people. No. At best, they're scamming 10 people before their account comes under scrutiny. Also, I think 500-1000 scam has almost the same jail time if done to multiple people, but the payout is far less. With amounts like 15k or 10k scammed from 10 people. They have an easy 1 to 1.5 lakh and repeating this process multiple times before they're caught guarantees them a lenient sentence because they have the money to get out of it. Its not like law will force them to pay it when there's no way to make them pay. If banks couldn't recover money from mallya , do you think they can even get an old 1000rs note from babu chhapri? Kaala dhan wapas aagya guys.. aache din begins. If you contact customer service, they can reverse the transaction. It takes 24 hours, but the scammer receives the notification of their refund request being accepted, and they close the account as soon as the money is credited to them. Not always true. I being the dumbass that I am by mistake sent about 3,000 rupees through Paytm UPI to somebody else instead of the intended person infront of said intended person. I first then sent 3000 rupees to the correct number and then after being free 15 minutes later I called the number that belonged to guy who I mistakenly sent 3000 rupees to and asked him to check his Paytm History and somehow got my money back. Thankfully he was the delivery guy that on occasion delivered my swiggy food to my house and he delivered my food 2 days prior to this happening and at the time of delivery I didn't have change with me so I Payed Via Paytm and that's how I identified myself to him.

Got 47k deposited in my account out of the blue. No information on sender or no reason given in the transaction details. I called my bank and they said I had to visit the branch to get info. So I said fuck that, no way I'm going to a branch in 2023. And I kept the money. Lol Kyu Bharosa nahi apne aap par? Apne Logo par? Kar Dikhane ki **Himmat** nahi hai ya **Haisiyat** nahi hai? Within how much time does the scammer get the refund? Merko pata nahi ke Rothschild pe kitna Paisa hai toh kese keh du, plus kabhi na kabhi toh ho hi jaiga Does anyone know if there is a way to block/filter unknown people sending money on our UPI? Sorry bro, it was a mistake I can send you my new account details and you can send it back 🤫😂 Aaaah. Purana account withdraw karlo There you go, it was the Swiggy delivery guy... though a stranger, there was a connection if a previous transaction. My point being, cases like yours are a dime in a dozen as compared to the scammer's transaction. Best to be vigilant at any cost. SCAM ALERT!!!!! Run to your bank Link that post Ignore Mudi ji deposited it. Finally. That's mine....please give it back🙂 Thank you ModiJi This is the 1st installment. Wait 9 years for the next one.

They can raise a ticket by themselves for the wrong transaction. Please don't fall prey to the scam. Neither use the money nor return it, keep it stagnant, if a ticket is raised on their end it will get deducted by itself or it can be frozen internally without your knowledge and they will bring to your knowledge later on. Just assume you never received it and leave it as it is. Modi ji ne bheja hoga Mudiji forgot two zeroes. Bharat bolo. Bharat banega **$7 Trillion** economy. (Added extra $2 trillion as a bonus due to name change) Its a scam Basically they create a fake company and use that to sent you money with credit card, once the transaction is done they call that person and ask for money they may sob or cry to you then they call credit card campany and tell them to reverse the original transfer transactions after you send them money so you lose both the mony Best bet is to keep the money for 7 days and don't transfer money if someone ask for it.

Just 15k? In this economy? The first installment of 15 lakh. 100 more to come. Seems like it's the upi id used when payment is made from paytm wallet, am not sure, but when I searched \"phonepe-payouts@yesbank\" online, few transaction histories are public (for unknow reasons) which have received money from it multiple times, and not sent back to anyone. And that's more than a year old. &#x200B; Anyone who has received money from phonepe wallet can confirm. u/SaiyanLonda From where did you check? 1 Tera 1 Mera, ye do Tera ye do mera Correct yourself.

It’s Modi ji Mudiji ne send Kiya 15000. 15,00,000 ki jagah CBI make me recall a comedy from Jailer See Jawan. You will know why haha Are you from odisha? There is news about many people getting different amounts through UPI today. Linked to only one bank Tranfer the money from you Paytm payments bank account into another account and make it nil. Wait for some days, if you receive a call from your bank bank then only take process forward by visiting them. Otherwise enjoy the money. March 2022 i received 55k in total via multiple cheque deposit into my kotak mahindra account. Cash withdrawal kiya. Then received only one call from bank asking to refund the money to nearest bank. I neglected that, rest I'm enjoying. don't spend a single rupee else you will be in big trouble If this is connected to your bank account, chances are your account will be frozen. Contact your bank asap. All the comments here explain well. You should be aware that banks will never send you money or call you asking for credit/debit cards or other financial information. The guy who sent you the money is a scammer and used the UPI refund policy after sending the amount to you. He already has this money returned to his account. Now he knows your no. so he'll call you and disguise as a bank clerk. Refuse to send and cut the call. Go to your local bank and check if the money has been sent back to the scammer then report their account. Bank name is the word after @. Word before @ is chosen by user. It could be scam. Do not send back even if they call n give some shit story. Tell them you will only give back (that's in case if it's a genuine case) in cash at a near by police station. If it's genuine they may agree and it's not they will not. Arey enjoy kar koi bole galti se di hain toh block that number Oho 15000, koi to kuchh plan kr baitha tha KLPD ho gya b echare ka Happened to me too. I received 5k from some unknown number and they called me back after a hour and asked me to return the money as it was sent by mistake. I was willing to send it back but they told me a different number and requested that the amount be sent to that number. It felt fishy to me so I told them I'd send it back to the same number only. They started saying some nonsense things like \"it's urgent, we don't have the phone, please send it to that number and WhatsApp that number the screenshot\". I hung up the phone and called my bro(he is police inspector). He told me to give him the number and called them up. after a hour he told me to send the money back to the same number i received. According to him, some people send money to random people and then ask them to send it back to a different number. Then they go to their bank and have the transaction cancelled which will result in the receiver loosing money from their bank. Since the request was done on call and most people don't record it, it will be too expensive to pursue it legally and most people will end dropping the case. Modi ji apne 15 lakh wala promise pura karna start kar diya🎊🎊🎊 Oh, so you entered the upi id in the box where you enter the upi id to make the payment. Isn't 20k the daily limit bro? Send money to my upi. I will take care of that from here on. You don't worry. My bad. Send it back to me. Ahh the classic double profit. He will ask for money from you and then he will also ask for the money from bank. Secondly once he get your id he may coax you to send some more by using techniques ki nahi mila abhi tak and all that. Gullible people fall for this. He will send 15 and get back 45. Double it and send it to next person. exactly Scammer. Scam him back by spending it and ignoring any unknown calls. This UPI ID belongs to Flipkart, when they refund in bank account, it is refunded through this UPI ID , most probably someone has mistakenly put your UPI ID while filling refund form. Or possibly someone from your family or friends have put this. Modiji ne vijwaye hai Bas 15 lakh ki jagah 15 hazar aa gye Rakhle modi ji ne bheje hai baaki ke 14 lakh 85 hazzar bhi aa jayengey Just sleep on this free money, no need to contact anyone. Anyone can file a case against you. Yes, it would be better if you file a police complaint in the nearest cyber office. He doesn't even mobile this happened with me also. its a glitch in Paytm. i thought i was a fool. Good bot Brother get some digital knowledge \"They can get access to everything from burner phones to stolen aadhar numbers of real people\" Can you tell me more about this? Do they get the victim's information after sending the money? It might be a mistake. Send it back 🤷🏽‍♀️ Hey, I think you can help me with this. Just posted [this](https://reddit.com/r/india/s/GU7ngAUWTj). Please have a look The return request will be of 150000. Sorry yar galti se dal gye tuje, u can send it back now. There is a recent scam going on in which you will receive a deposit of money like this, and later, you may receive a call from scammer's female employees claiming that they have transferred the amount mistakenly and pleading you to return it to them, as this money is for an emergency, like her father's surgery or something similar, to make you feel tense and eager to help. Now, the actual scheme starts: she will send you a payment request but will add one or two zeros to the actual amount. For example, instead of 15,000, she might add a zero, making it 150,000. So, if you are anxious and complete the transaction, boom, it could be the costliest mistake you have ever made in your life. Be cautious of this type of cheating. They will manipulate your emotions to play their games. Double it and give it to the next person Befizul 2 trillion mat add karo. Hamare PM sahab yeh extra 2 trillion duniya ko de ayenge. Mr Rathore sends his regards TBH they are Lightyear's away from ROTHSCHILD! True dat! They aren't just leaving because of Duties and restrictions! They also want Higher Standard of living along with a Good legal system that is not biased/Partial towards one Particular group! So, I had a similar case with dad’s account a few weeks ago. Someone transferred 20K to his account. And then called him and the usual drama about how he mistyped the number. Now I have trained my dad well. So, he said he would need to check with his son before anything can be done. This was at around 7pm and I was not available at the moment. Next morning, he told me. I am baffled and confused about what kind of scam this could be. I mean I did not really think about what’s mentioned in the above comment that he might try to get refund through his bank and get double the money. Anyways… I called him, asked him to send me message on PhonePe chat (where the transaction was made) that the funds were transferred by mistake and I have accepted to send the money back… so that I can have some proof of the two transactions. Not that it would have made much of a difference. And then I transferred the funds back. Nothing happened after that. So, I guess, I got lucky. One thing that did come to my mind were reports where people found their bank accounts frozen due to weird transactions with bank accounts associated with people with criminal past or something like that. [Freeze, you are being demonetised by police, banks | Kerala News | Manorama English](https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2023/04/14/bank-accounts-frozen-unauthorized-transaction.html) I can understand your position honestly. >Yes, then it will reflect the banking details under the transaction. > >But if you are speaking of the name displayed by various UPI apps, it's not like that. Actually it does not allow screen shot, otherwise I could have explained it better. Damn! Why don't these things happen to me. Yeah I mean as a student these things affect me if I get older and get job I don’t want to be judged and feminism and all that bs Jokes on you, I use fampay(50 se jada hote ni usme) On point Boi! Fuck that **WOKE** Bullshit! \"Jandhan is not real , It cannot hurt you\" Jandhan: i understood that reference Jst use the money... The same thing happened to me it was 1500rps so i used it up 🤣 nothing happened Bhyi 4k mughe dede Test Bhai party...?? Call/Email your bank & give consent to return funds to the remitter (sender), if the remitter claims the money from your bank via CHARGEBACK process, your bank will return the funds as per your consent. This happens when someone types an incorrect mobile number/VPA and sends funds w/o checking beneficiary account name Mostly it could happen by mistake . Same has done by me but the amount was very less. Please wait , the Sender will try to contact you. If not you may inform your bank. If it appears to you from a scammer after some digging, donate that to some poor in or charity Wrong bro, There are scams I know, but always give consent to the bank informing that you are unaware of the funds sent remitter/sender. this will act as records if something happens like fraud cases and online financial fraud cases, I worked for bank for 3y under chargeback/fraud investigation team, I know how this works. Your bank account will soon be blocked for any transactions by cyber cell 15 lakh ka pehla installment aa gaya.. Mujhe 1019 rs mile thhe main toh kharch kar diye. It could be Modi ji mistakenly transferred 15k instead of promised 15 Lakh. I'm still waiting for the 15 Lakh to show up in my account. SCAMMERS WILL NOT SEND you 15K, this looks like a genuine transaction, contact the bank and return it. So, I was in a hurry and I had to pay to my uber driver amount of 800rs but I had no change. Then he asked me to pay through paytm but my camera wasn't working to scan his scanner and asked for his paytm phone number instead, but I sent the amount to a different person mistakenly. Later I called that person and I asked if he had received that amount he checked and said yes. Then I sent my scanner's screenshot to him. But after that I received no amount I even texted him did you pay the amount he just blue ticked the message and didn't reply. He probably thought I am a scammer XD XD XD XD. I LOST MY 800RS THO Modi ji 15 lakh ki jagah 15000 daal diye. Expect 1485000 more. Let me answer from personal experience: it is possibly because of someone putting the wrong number while paying someone else. If they are smart, they will complain to the Bank and the Bank will investigate. Two zeroes are missing bro No, don't do this, your life might get in danger . [ref.blewcash.com/yungga](https://ref.blewcash.com/yungga) Bro. Can you explain that to me in hindi? Aapne jo bhi bola, pura mere oopar se gaya, dimaag ki field pe bounce hua hi nai. Has the sender contacted you and asked to return his money? Ohh okay. Actually, all upi providers have access to that data (IFSC code and other stuff), just that they don't show that. I don't know why. I thought it was because of some rule by NPCI, but since nsdl jiffy is showing, other providers aren't showing the data by their own choice. We just told wait some time, and then discussed and proceeded not to do anything. Cuz others said they would be reverting the money somehow Modi Ji sent money to your bank account /s If you receive call immediately report to bank and cyber crime portal, from call they use software to hack your bank account plus your mobile. Kindly return , it's a mistake . If it was a scam then they might have used 500 or 1000 Do you own an Ola scooter? Whoa... seriously?? 😮 Didn't know this could happen.. thanks. It's your money now. Party 🎉 I am a banker and that's not how it works. I've heard cases where people have been credited large sums of money which they've ended up spending and then spent time in jail. So use it at your own risk. UPI ID DM karle bro. Bhai, jab bhi upi/online koi unknown payment aata hai jisko aap nahi jaante, aap bank k official customer care email pe likho k \"yeh paisa mera nahi hai, yeh paise aap retun kar do jiska hai, yeh paise mere ko nahi chaiyeh, mera nahi hai\", toh future me koi fraud/criminal case ata hai, toh yeh email aap ko jhamela(trouble) se bachayega Kisi fresher ki internship payment mil gyi op ko Wow Modi ji ke 15lakh ka pehla instalment :D This is a SCAM! Don't send money back if requested using emotional blackmailing! Block and report. Google pay has this feature before receiving from new person. Paytm don't have it on first time, but you can visit the three dots for more options and block and report it! Also, complain to Cyber cell using it's number 1903 something like this! Yeah maybe, I recently got scammed. I had NSDL jiffy, I was able to contact the receiver bank branch & block the receivers account with few minutes & was able to save my money. If you wanna you can keep it, no one can force you, their mistake. But if you wanna just send it back to the number it came from just UPI back to same UPI account, avoid calls if scammers can try for begging for mercy and say i did not receive money, they'll complain n all, as long as it came and went back in their same bank account. Its done. Don't cave in, don't be bothered, legally its your money which you sent to them now, keep a screenshot of accounts and UPI transfers. How does it work then? I too am finding a difficult time seeing how this scam will work without being obviously visible that it’s a scam. Not everything is scam. Sometimes it's only a digits difference between upi id and people do send money by mistake. I have seen many scams as part of my job but hardly any where scammers take the initiative to send money first. Don't tell me scammers are relying on general publics honesty to get that back. Also banks don't pay you money if you send it to wrong number by mistake. Banks will be filing for delinquency if it happened like that. Also there is high chance receiver won't get call from sender if the upi id is not mobile number. Because unless you yourself don't disclose your information such as mobile number etc is protected on these apps. That's falsehood. If that happened I'll go shop at some mall and then request refund. Please don't believe in these false messages. What loads of crap this person is spreading. One you only need one fraud transaction to get under scrutiny. Second even if you close your account your personal information is still protected with the bank and police can access it with one order. I think I know this scam.. I might be wrong. But I know someone who lost 3.6 Lacs to such kinda scam recently. She got a call from a person from cybercrime (fake one) She was informed that the money is related to drug trafficking and got her on a skype call with 5/6 people and then they demanded money to let go of this case. They also had aadhar card details and so on.. Best is to report it to your bank about this and make it official like on email and so on. If you get any fraud call report it to Cybercell/police right away. Modiji Wale paise aane Lage kya?????? guys please explain how is someone accidently sending you money and asking for a return scam? Please explain to me. I dont understand this can someone explain this to me more simply? This is just a bad scam. The max profit is only 100% money. But the risk involved is too high right? Count your blessings Bhai !! G20 foreign delegates are trying digital India UPI things. I guess Modi Ji is delivering his promise of 15 lakh. Great days to come big ups folks🤡 That’s modiji giving 15lakh Ohh nice. I will also download the jiffy upi app. This is pretty useful, I didn't think of it this way. Thanks. Ha bhai muze bhi 20000rs Aaye they iske baad maine 1 month sim card nikalwake rakkha tha ki koi return call karke maang nale Mereko bhej de bhai >Although some scammers do scam from smaller amounts but it is only because they're new and aren't aware that they'll have to buy new credentials which dont come cheap. Scammers who know what they're doing dont use the same upi id to scam tens of thousands of people. No. At best, they're scamming 10 people before their account comes under scrutiny. Also, I think 500-1000 scam has almost the same jail time if done to multiple people, but the payout is far less. With amounts like 15k or 10k scammed from 10 people. They have an easy 1 to 1.5 lakh and repeating this process multiple times before they're caught guarantees them a lenient sentence because they have the money to get out of it. Its not like law will force them to pay it when there's no way to make them pay. If banks couldn't recover money from mallya , do you think they can even get an old 1000rs note from babu chhapri? 1% of modijis promised money..keep it..more installments to follow Mujhe dede bhai nhi chiye toh 😭😭 bro what if some uncle sent you by mistake?? The upi transactions are irreversible so they can't send reverse request to their bank. tell your bank about it maybe they can trace where the money came from. if it doesnt work maybe take it to cyber police. after all if you've found a wallet on road you would try to return it to police. Thanks, didn't knew it was possible. What happens if you just refuse to send it back? Elections are near it seems 😂 No idea.... About 26 years ago, I got an amount in the equivalent of Rs 45,000 in my account. My salary was around the same amount. I withdrew part of the amount from the bank. Unbeknownst to me, a couple of days later, my salary came in. When I withdrew some more cash, I saw the excess. Those days, we did not have sms facility. I took a mini statement and noticed the earlier credit was not my salary and informed the bank. The guy at the customer service did not want to admit their mistake initially but after a few days, the amount was reversed. I always wondered what would have happened if I did not report this to the bank. I know, I would have lived in fear if I used the money. Modiji ne bheja hoga 15lakh la pehla installment hoga shayad IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME!!!! 26 years ago, your salary was 45K? Wow you must be very rich Not true, you did get scammed First installment of the 15L Modi promised Lol, it was very low... I'm not in India, mate. This salary was not in India and you converted it to INR? Scam 😝 Since it is an Indian sub I cannot believe this has 400+ upvotes. I call bullshit. No UPI provider, or even the bank in question has the power of debiting the amount back from your account and \"reversing\" the transaction. What you have mentioned ONLY APPLIES ON CREDIT CARDS, and NOT on UPI. In UPI, once the amount is received, it's YOURS. There is no escrow in between and there is no scope of reversibility. Exactly this! That person is spreading so much bullshit and people here are trusting him. This could put someone who genuinely sent money to the wrong person in distress. My bad bro I think I had by mistakenly sent it, you can resend me on my number, i have dmed you the number. Thanks bro😊👍 Modiji do zero Kam Hai isme toh This also happened to me. I received 14k rs and they are messaging me to send it back. What should I do , I am doubting on their behaviour. the upi id from which it was sent seems to be impersonating a legitimate app, so seems unlikely this is an honest mistake. you can visit the npci website and claim refund for errors. Not sure how it works but they must have some sort of verification before giving you the refund. Modizee changed 15,00,000 to 15,000. But atleast he did something. Han bhai vo galti se send hogye the yaar , dm krna Han Bhai galti se mene bhej diye vapas de 😂💀 15Lackh hoga as promised by someone Idhar bhej do yaar..!!! Came here to do this exact same comment 😂 Technologically challenged? Bhai 200 milayge? Aree mene galti se bhej diye the ,plz return🙂 Try giving it back .maybe kisi gareeb aadmi ke ho It's not random bro. It's the first installment of the \"15 Lakhs\" obviously. Have seen a similar case where money was transferred by mistake. You may receive a call from the sender. Ask the person to come to your nearest police station where you can hand over the money to the person in presence of the police. As someone who works in a fintech company. This is extremely common. The payment is from PhonePe and it's their generic payouts VPA. But I see 3 possibilities: &#x200B; 1. You got a refund / credit from wallet to bank (If you're sure you didn't pay out anyone in recent times, then this rules out). 2. Someone was trying to pay rent via CC and paid you by mistake (I'm not sure if the rental payouts go through this VPA, have to cross check). 3. Some scammer has carded and sent you the payment to later request you to send it back to their other account which basically is money laundering, so when the actual CC holder disputes, you end up losing money since the bank will put a hold on your account while you've already lost the 15k. Meanwhile the scammer has siphoned off the stolen funds from someone via you. Victim = You. Total damage = 15k. Wow the amount of bullshit you can pull out of your ass is astonishing. What exactly do you think happens if someone reports an accidental transaction to a bank? Do you think the bank just returns the money? People like you are the worst kind of scum. Because of you someone who genuinely made a mistake will go through hell and at the same time no real scam will be avoided since there IS NO SCAM that works like this. And what exactly do you think will happen if the op receives the call? Well the person bite his ear through the phone? I know that spreading unwarranted fear and sensationalism is the favourite pastime of middle aged women and teenage girls but because of you someone genuinely in trouble will go through hell. Aunty ji relax No PhonePe cannot ask you to return money. What proof do they have that to the sender didn’t actually buy something from you? No possibility of a scam here. Learn to think for yourself instead of WhatsApp forwards from teenagers. Modi is giving you back what he promised. 1% at a time. Congratulations. That's your first of the hundredth 15 lakh instalment from modiji 15 lakh installments mein aa rahe hain kya? Areee 15,00,000 aane shuru ho gaye kya ? dog shit God i see what you have done for others Kuch bhi bolta hai chup Most probably galti se transfer kardiya hoga. Has happened with me once The same thing happened to me yesterday. i received 14K Rupees and they were willing me to send it back saying that their mom is serious but after a few hours 1 or 2 they are messaging that their mom is dead WTF ! Randomly pay it to me ☺️ Are you okay, buddy? Maybe it's the first installment of the money modiji had to give 10 years back. He told he will recover the black money from Swiss bank and credit to our account. So prolly 15k is the first installment lol Wait for a few months and you'll receive the remaining 14.85lakhs. Arey bhaiyye ham hi bhej diye the galati se wapas kar do 🤣 Please inform your bank and take a receiving of the same you never know where that money came from so keep yourself safe. Arey merse hogya bhai galti se return krde please, papa marenge And here I am Only receiving random spam calls from \"Mukesh Panter\" I meant say phone pe will ask your bank and will show the transaction as peoof Finally some sensible answer Vikram rathore sent it. Happy birthday Underrated comment Just report it to the bank. Don't send the money back without consulting the bank, just to be safe. It could be just a simple mistake or a scam. You have my update for your confidence Bhai mene hi Kiya tha galti se waps bhej de mereko bhaiyaa jiii thodaa panii pillaa dijyeeee I accidentally sent someone 7k by accident once and never got it back even though I tried contacting the bank and the person. I’m not sure how safe it is, but you can revert the money because someone might need it more than you. Bro stop spreading bullshit Why do you say that, please explain. Individual level pe toh hoga na. You might not need that money, someone helpless might make something out of it. He divided 15L with 10 and sent 15k 🤣🤣🤣 Send me no issues 🙂🙂 Same. A banker and this explanation is ridiculous. The only way it would work is if the bank intiates a refund without intimation, which would lead to anotherb deduction of the same amount. But that doesn't happen in India AFAIK. Do you work for any government? Don't refund anyone if they ask you unless they have undeniable proof. When we enter the UPI ID before paying, it displays the full registered name of account holder. I did the same with above ID and it shows corporate name of PhonePe Private limited. So I think it is not scam and you should contact PhonePe. Kaun hai hamare beech me \"AZAD\". Azad bhai, I didn't receive it in my account. I will mail you my account number. Yeah and even then the bank can’t do shit. At most, the bank can request you to return money. Yes and none of what she taught in the video works. It doesn’t work at all. Just because the girl looks good you’re going to trust everything she says? What a simp. Aaj dinner kaha se aa ra! A lot of people with no clue about cybersec are giving out half-assed, panicky advice. Okay boss, sounds like you are an expert. Kindly enlighten us on what you would do on such a situation? Do whatever you feel like doing. If you feel bad for the person that paid you, return the money. If you’re feeling uneasy about it, ask the bank to return it on your behalf. Yay! On a serious note, could be a mistake payment. Your UPI ID might be one letter off or something from the target individual's You are absolutely right but this scam actually do happen on paypal where money is actually refundable. Not in upi Though. Yet what the op says of going through the banks customer care is the best way to avoid any future pitfalls as the cyber police of India is as incompetent and corrupt as possible. You will get a call asking you to return the money ( through other channel than UPI ) after you transfer the money. He will undo his UPI transaction. making you lose 15000 rupees and you can not do anything about it because the UPI and the bank accounts are temporary accounts Modi ji ne bheja hoga... They will ask you to send it back, dont, tell them to come and get cash, or raise dispute through bank. Aare bhaiya bhool se apko de diya. Please return I heard that it's a scam, the person may call you or text to say like \"IT WAS A MISTAKE PLEASE I HOPE YOU RETURN MY MONEY BACK PLEASE\" but he want you account details. When you return the money, more of your details will expose to him. And he can hack your account and there are many cases few month ago that people are getting money by accident and when they return it their account got hacked... But my school driver once made a mistake in front of me and he asked him to return. Next day i ask to uncle next day that you got your money back or not... He returned his money, Good for him driver usually get paid less so i am gald that he return.... Well so you don't really know if it is a scam or not No don not do it as soon as you pay the money .. the scammer will get acces to your bank and then you know Duniya ko kyon denge? Unka anmol ratan, aakhon ka tara Adani hai na. Usko denge. Nerendre Mondis 15L is reyal Here is my story. Received 5000 from a number on my UPI. I didn't receive any call for 2 days. After two days, I got a call for a refund because it happened by mistake. I told him that his money was safe. Please raise a complaint with your bank and you will get the money. I am still rich by 5000. Though received multiple calls from unknown numbers and didn't bother to pick. Arh maine send krdiya tha glti se wps krdo 😂😂😂 Jaldi cash out karalo. Pata Chale koi maange aa jaaye 1st installment thi. Patience needed. Contact the customer team or simply return the money modi ji ne bheja hain. If you get anyone calling and asking you for sending the money back to the number get alert and as this can be a fraud you can ask him to meet directly and get cash as reverting the money back may share your confidential details to the scammer. It's mine pls return Probably the first installment of 15 lakh for every citizen?😂😜 Hi one of my close relative..unka Paytm payment bank ka account block ho Gaya which I had balance of 20,000 .. .ek scammer ne bheja 10,000 and uske baad Paytm blocked my relative account and it's a business account..aur ab paise aa rahe toh account block hai and Paytm bhi help nhi kar raha What should they do Hey! Can you share a picture/screenshot showing any random UPI IDs details? Just want to see what all shows up. You can share it here [https://imgur.com/upload](https://imgur.com/upload) or just reply with the pic here directly Not with 15 K ! I'm a Doctor and a Patient Sent me 98,000 Rupees instead of 980 Rupees accidentally. I refused to return her the money Online and gave her cold hard cash . Hey, what ended up happening? I had faced similar thing getting money from random numbers twice. Started to research on this topic. Turns out my friend was giving my number to the people he needed to get money from since he did not use UPI and forgot to tell me about it.😂😂😂 Even though these kind of scams might happen. There's a higher chance that this is just a mistake from sender's side rather than an actual scam. As scammers in general don't spend huge money directly on their single victim. Regardless take all the standard precautions while dealing with these things if sender contacted you. Check with your close ones friends and family about this transaction. Once you are sure about the transaction is suspicious just inform bank to revert it back to the sender. Bhai upi id dede magicpin pe 26 k chhole bhature aare h"
