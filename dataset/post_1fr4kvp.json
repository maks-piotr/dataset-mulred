        "I saw entire Indian hockey team at McDonald's once, no one cared about them. They just sat in peace and ate. I started a small talk with one of the players in Punjabi at the billing counter. This was in Bangalore near their training facility at SAI. ",
        "Le moot diya khud ke sports career pe!\n\nDude! Don't be jealous some people are more popular than you. Invoking *Hockey is a national sport* to rally support hasn't worked before, it won't work now. Win things and people will rally behind you. \n\nBut hockey isn't a big sport anywhere, yes it is an Olympics sport but it isn't the biggest sport in any country, so it will always be limited in economics and popularity.",
        "So what he is a self made star.",
        "Social media ka time hai, kya ho gaya bhai ko ?\nIf you want to be happy dont keep any expectations",
        "Exactly. Alot of people are popular, but every one has issues with Dolly's popularity",
        "That's the IQ of average Indian striving for recognition from even a street vendor....",
        "Tata Tea GOLD Medalist 😝",
        "Winning an Olympic Bronze medal is a big thing. \n\nAlso I assume that \"Dolly....\" is some social media celebrity. His achievements are what precisely?",
        "People think he got overnight fame last year ,nobody knows about his past struggles. I have known him since 2010, he has been quite popular in nagpur since then. Comes from very poor household, also seen many people saying education is sc6am n all on his comment section. But he himself said once that to cater his family he had to leave studies n had to work.",
        "Lmfao. I dont understand the saltiness from the cricketers here. \n\nSecondly, nobody would bat an eye lid if a celebrity like Elvish Yadav got such attention or even some other like Shah Rukh. \n\n\nI dont get why people feel entitled to shit on Dolly Chaiwala. He became viral, through a specific set of skills, which is looked down upon in society. But yet, he put it across in an entertaining fashion and he earned his fame - maybe 15minutes of it. \n\n\nLets face it, I wouldn't recognise many cricketers out there in the wild, but i will recognise Dolly Chaiwala. \n\nHere all I'm seeing is the cricketer is feeling offended ki why nobody clicked a selfie with them, these same people once they're famous will shoo people away..\n\nToo much entitlement here.",
        "Everybody ass is burning coz of his fame.. \n\nThinking is \"How can a chai seller earn more? He is lower in society than I am. I did engineering yet he earns more\".",

        "Sorry but bronze might be big because of how much we suck, but it isn't winning. I have seen us losing in a lot of hockey tournaments, 2010 world cup and 2011 Commonwealth live in the stadium, many other on the TV. Now I don't care about the team. \n\nStill love the sport but the whole federation needs to come together and win tournaments. I don't wanna feel like how the Indian cricket team was like in the 90s, good for only QFs and SFs.",
        "The fact is that in this world, people who haven't worked hard, haven't done anything meaningful can get fame and money, it HEAVILY depends on luck. But it's always temporary as most people aren't able to take the long term advantage of that fame and money.",
        "No no this cooment just shows your IQ , that guy is internet famous . This what happens to people famous on the internet. People wanna take photos with them to get some social media heat. Very new concept to you I guess.",

        "Winning an Olympic medal in India should be a big deal because of our overall count of medals around 40 IIRC\n\nI'm not saying that Indian Hockey is not frustrating. It is !",
        "Bro, there are hundreds of Olympics winners in western countries and China and their public too doesn't remember them.  \n\n\nSuppose in a room, you have the American volleyball team and a famous personality like Mr. Beast or Speed. Who will you recognise first?",
        ">Secondly, nobody would bat an eye lid if a celebrity like Elvish Yadav\n\nPeople don't like Elvish Yadav being popular too(tho he's popular for all the wrong reasons). The problem with dolly being popular is, he is a proud ambedkarite",
        ">The fact is that in this world, people who haven't worked hard, haven't done anything meaningful can get fame and money,\n\nWorked hard. Dolly was already popular before the bill gates thing and he has worked his ass off day in and day out.",
        "Hockey has a proper world cup, which matters more than the Olympics. And as I said, being good the QFs and SFs alone isn't good enough.",
        "Hire a PR team if u want recognition",
        "He must have struggled as a chai wala, but it's nothing compared to the hardwork of Olympic medalists. And people do get fame and money without much hard work nowadays, I don't hate those people, but it's just the truth",

        "“Same people will shoo them away” is sooo apt. Then it will suddenly be “please respect our privacy”, “we don’t like to be disturbed”, “It’s okay to be rude to fans, you can’t expect us to be polite all the time” etc. I think we should all let this celebrity culture die across the board. A lot of these people treat common people like vermin. Just ignore them and do your thing, they’ll come back to earth pretty soon.",

        "They talked about hockey",
        "How are you so sure about Individual entitlement and offended part here? For me it's like no one recognized player who played for India because it's not popular like cricket. He had some expectations from his country and feeling sad. I am sure player feeling would be same if some cricketer was there in place of that Chaiwala. \n\nIt's indeed sad reality of the fake world of social media. I have no issue with Chaiwala or his fans but I am sad theses days people have different priority. Everyone should become like Dolly Chaiwala and his fans and ignore things that matter in real life and for the country.",
        "When you see them peoples running for selfies for some viral clipper,you should feel happy,there’s really less competition in the world.",
        "It wouldn't have made news or a topic of discussion if it was a cricketer or a Ratan Tata.\n\nHeck I doubt the player would've made a fuss at all if that was the case, just like you assumed he would've. \n\nSorry, how does hockey or cricket matter in real life over Dolly Chaiwala? Both categories are just entertainment.",
        "Same goes for older generation 'cricket stars' - out of sight, out of mind. \n\nMy BIL and I once saw Srinath enjoying a buffet at a hotel's where we were staying. Hardly anyone bothered him till my BIL walked up to him and chatted him up. No selfies, no nothing.",
        "You didn't get the point, seems to be Dolly Chaiwala fan. Its okay.",
        "Lol so much saltiness. Wonder if he would’ve had the same problem if it was Modi, Tata or some actor or cricketer who were given the same attention while ignoring him. Dolly has worked hard and has developed his own fanbase and he’s not even been in any scam afaik",
        "I am completely out of loop. Who is this dolly chaiwala",
        "Yeah, this Guy is a self deprecating meme made famous by Bill Gates and the internet just for shits and giggles. I bet his chai isn't anything special either.. kal ko koi Suit boot pehennewala doodhwala aayega and the internet will forget this guy even existed. So let him enjoy his 5 min of fame while it lasts.",
        "No cricket?? damn..",
        "Recognition comes easy for the loud and shallow, while those who truly build the nation are left with silence and disrespect.",
        "Exactly. I can't understand the problem people have with dolly, he's minding his own business. There are so many other popular guys doing shady shit, why every one behind dolly?",
        "He's a tea seller who was popular on tiktok for his unique tea making style, his fame grew multifold when bill gates met hun",

        ">celebrity like Elvish Yadav\n\nbud he is a fucking criminal",

        "I assumed because you first assumed that hockey player being salty, offended but you didn't assumed that he could be just sad that no one recognized a National player who plays for country. You didn't assumed that he could be happy if some people also recognized him along with Dolly Chaiwala.",
        "I am here like who is Dolly Chaiwala",

It will literally make them feel inadequate. So the media, masters in psychological manipulation, will never give them enough coverage. In the end they are businesses. If the majority of society want to see an uneducated 'chaiwalla' over our sports people who have dedicated years of their life excelling in their field, it is a commentary on the kind of society we live in, not the businesses that cater to them. \n\nTLDR; society chhapri so media displays chhapri people.

        ">National sports do exist, just not on paper.\n\nJust because some people say it doesn't mean it's a national sport. It has to be identified by the country for that status.\n\n>want to see an uneducated 'chaiwalla' over our sports people who have dedicated years of their life excelling in their field\n\nIt depends on what sport. If it was a cricketer who played for the national team, he would be recognised as they are constantly in the media. If it was some famous movie stars, they would also be recognised. If it was Tata or Ambani, they would also be recognised. So it simply depends on the media. The basketball players of our country also dedicate their whole life to sport but I am sure that 99 percent (even more actually) won't be able to even name a single player. \n\nCan you yourself name the current basketball team without looking it up? Can you name our rugby team? If yes. Good and impressed.\n\n>TLDR; society chhapri so media displays chhapri people. Society fit so media will display excellence.\n\nIt would be the same for almost every country though. The people in media would be recognised more over people who are playing not so famous sports (especially in team sports).\n\nAnd finally, it's not like Dolly chaiwala became an overnight success. He too worked hard to reach here and there is only one dolly like that. Gordon Ramsay would be recognised over a lot of sports people in the UK, US, etc.. doesn't mean that's bad.",
        "We love to play cricket and watch cricket more though. Has been the case for years now. Doesn't make it the national sport of india. \n\nSo for it to be recognised as a national sport, it indeed has to be specified by the government.",

        ">common people like vermin\n\nA lot of celebrities are indeed very entitled, and do believe that their time and convenience is far more valuable than that of others, so you're not right about that\n\nBut sometimes people conflate a famous person not wanting to take a selfie (and no that's not a part of their job description), with them being rude, which is not usually the case. If a famous person doesn't want to interact with strangers and conveys the same with common courtesy, then they're fully in the right",
        "A person can easily feel the difference between these two cases. For instance, my dad met Sachin and Supriya Pilgaonkar, and while they didn’t want to get pictures clicked, they were super sweet and polite to him, and chatted with him a bit after dad told them about how our family watches their movies together, and are all big fans. We’ve thankfully never encountered a bad celebrity, but sometimes you can just feel the hostility, arrogance, and superiority coming off of somebody. I feel that especially with double-faced celebrities who act in an attention-seeking way and then complain about how everyone’s obsessed with them. Like, they conflate their own importance to feel superior to others.",
        "I have seen L Balaji and D Karthik at the airport. Not many people recognized them and attended to take photo.

        "Yeah, these are people who've built their career on their uncommon athleticism, artistic talent or good looks, of-course of they have huge egos. Some of them are just are better at masking it in public\n\nAlso, outside of a few people who probably already have a reputation for being assholes, most celebs don't actually do what you described. They might be curt to, or ignore a stranger that approached them out of nowhere, but that's less them putting others down, and more just them wanting to be left alone\n\nAgain, as a fan, you're not in any way entitled to their time, unless you actually paid for a meet and greet (or something else of the sort). A lot of celebrities just indulge their fans, because it's better for their reputation, and by extension careers. But again, that's not a part of their job",
        "Bro first of all I don’t feel entitled to anyone’s time. I haven’t asked any celeb for an autograph in my life except Gulzaar Sahab. Secondly, there are some genuinely nice people who are celebrities, who are happy to speak to you and interact with you. No ego, no pretence. And then there’s genuine assholes. I know a very mainstream indie Indian singer who broke out pretty big in the last 4-5 years, and he’s a garbage person. Nothing about his personal life or time or privacy is the reason behind his behaviour. He’s just a piece of shit human being who uses his fans for sex, scoring drugs, getting gigs, and then ditches them. He’ll show up 2 hours late for a concert and will be wasted half the time. He displays the same shit personality at every place. People like that are indefensible.",
        ">nice people who are celebrities, who are happy to speak to you and interact with you\n\n>No ego, no pretence.\n\nThose things can very much be mutually exclusive. As I said, some people see public interaction as valuable to their brand, and thus are quite generous to their fans. That doesn't mean they can't also be egotistical assholes\n\nIn fact, whenever a story about an actor being an awful person breaks, some of the first comments are usually fans saying something to the effect of \"but he was so nice that one time 12 years ago\"\n\n>broke out pretty big in the last 4-5 years, and he’s a garbage person.\n\n\"Scumbag gets fame, immediately exploits said fame, and becomes increasingly unprofessional\". Yeah, that happens too, quite a lot in fact. But isn't that a different conversation entirely?\n\nWe were talking about whether ignoring fans who approach you in public, is inappropriate, which is clearly not the central issue with the dude you mentioned",

Because they spent time and money to advertise themselves, they changed with the time by introducing T20, the recent popularity of kabbadi is again because they learned that prompting the spot is important. What coverage does hockey get for anyone not already a fan of hockey? A passing remark in the media? Why would any new person be interested in watching it?

Besides, Hockey is a fast paced sport, which makes it difficult to focus on each player and for people to recognize by just faces unless they follow regularly.\n\nTo the people complaining about non-performance, our Hockey teams are literally one of our best performing teams and are medal contenders and consistently producing results since last few years. One of the best teams in the world now. How is it that Indian footballers are more popular than Hockey players despite being mediocre at world level? Because it's not about performance, it's about visibility, coverage and fan culture which also exists in Indian hockey but not as much as Indian football or cricket.\n\nSecondly, cricket and football have a league which fans follow regularly which Indian hockey doesn't at this point. I am sure the upcoming Hockey India League at the end of the year would bring some recognition and private investment towards hockey.\n\nTo solve this issue of people only focusing on hockey once in 4 years and bringing hockey the attention it deserves, we created r/Indianfieldhockey so that more people regularly follow this beautiful sport of ours.",

    "light_cleaned_comments": "Tata Tea GOLD 🪙 I saw entire Indian hockey team at McDonald's once, no one cared about them. They just sat in peace and ate. I started a small talk with one of the players in Punjabi at the billing counter. This was in Bangalore near their training facility at SAI. Le moot diya khud ke sports career pe! Dude! Don't be jealous some people are more popular than you. Invoking *Hockey is a national sport* to rally support hasn't worked before, it won't work now. Win things and people will rally behind you. But hockey isn't a big sport anywhere, yes it is an Olympics sport but it isn't the biggest sport in any country, so it will always be limited in economics and popularity. So what he is a self made star. Social media ka time hai, kya ho gaya bhai ko ? If you want to be happy dont keep any expectations Exactly. Alot of people are popular, but every one has issues with Dolly's popularity That's the IQ of average Indian striving for recognition from even a street vendor.... Tata Tea GOLD Medalist 😝 Winning an Olympic Bronze medal is a big thing. Also I assume that \"Dolly....\" is some social media celebrity. His achievements are what precisely? People think he got overnight fame last year ,nobody knows about his past struggles. I have known him since 2010, he has been quite popular in nagpur since then. Comes from very poor household, also seen many people saying education is sc6am n all on his comment section. But he himself said once that to cater his family he had to leave studies n had to work. Lmfao. I dont understand the saltiness from the cricketers here. Secondly, nobody would bat an eye lid if a celebrity like Elvish Yadav got such attention or even some other like Shah Rukh. I dont get why people feel entitled to shit on Dolly Chaiwala. He became viral, through a specific set of skills, which is looked down upon in society. But yet, he put it across in an entertaining fashion and he earned his fame - maybe 15minutes of it. Lets face it, I wouldn't recognise many cricketers out there in the wild, but i will recognise Dolly Chaiwala. Here all I'm seeing is the cricketer is feeling offended ki why nobody clicked a selfie with them, these same people once they're famous will shoo people away.. Too much entitlement here. Everybody ass is burning coz of his fame.. Thinking is \"How can a chai seller earn more? He is lower in society than I am. I did engineering yet he earns more\". Cricketer? Read properly. Every hardik is not a Cricketer man 😂. Except every hardik is a playboy who hooks up with people at weddings. Sorry typo in anger. Corrected. He got famous after making tea for bill gates, and apparently he shot a short promo vid type with bill gates? Still, it doesn't matter Sorry but bronze might be big because of how much we suck, but it isn't winning. I have seen us losing in a lot of hockey tournaments, 2010 world cup and 2011 Commonwealth live in the stadium, many other on the TV. Now I don't care about the team. Still love the sport but the whole federation needs to come together and win tournaments. I don't wanna feel like how the Indian cricket team was like in the 90s, good for only QFs and SFs. The fact is that in this world, people who haven't worked hard, haven't done anything meaningful can get fame and money, it HEAVILY depends on luck. But it's always temporary as most people aren't able to take the long term advantage of that fame and money. No no this cooment just shows your IQ , that guy is internet famous . This what happens to people famous on the internet. People wanna take photos with them to get some social media heat. Very new concept to you I guess. What Dolly Chai waala has achieved is more than a gold medal! 😜 Winning an Olympic medal in India should be a big deal because of our overall count of medals around 40 IIRC I'm not saying that Indian Hockey is not frustrating. It is ! Bro, there are hundreds of Olympics winners in western countries and China and their public too doesn't remember them. Suppose in a room, you have the American volleyball team and a famous personality like Mr. Beast or Speed. Who will you recognise first? >Secondly, nobody would bat an eye lid if a celebrity like Elvish Yadav People don't like Elvish Yadav being popular too(tho he's popular for all the wrong reasons). The problem with dolly being popular is, he is a proud ambedkarite >The fact is that in this world, people who haven't worked hard, haven't done anything meaningful can get fame and money, Worked hard. Dolly was already popular before the bill gates thing and he has worked his ass off day in and day out. Hockey has a proper world cup, which matters more than the Olympics. And as I said, being good the QFs and SFs alone isn't good enough. Hire a PR team if u want recognition He must have struggled as a chai wala, but it's nothing compared to the hardwork of Olympic medalists. And people do get fame and money without much hard work nowadays, I don't hate those people, but it's just the truth >but it's nothing compared to the hardwork of Olympic medalists. Why are we comparing the hardwork of two different fields? Should the national player and olympic medalist? Yes. But do we have to compare their fame and hardwork with dolly. A big NO Even dogs have a standard for having role model and who they follow, your pathetic reply displays your fatherless upbringing and everything that is wrong with this country. This, he doesn't seem to have scammed people like MBA chaiwala or any other chaiwala, still gets hated more than them for that very specific reason. All I meant to say was amount of hardwork isn't directly proportional to the fame and wealth a person has or makes. Whya re you fuming over it? That's just the truth. Such a sad state of affairs in this nation. Are you illiterate ? do you not know the difference between role model and social media clout ? Get some help. Don't advertise your upbringing here. Nobody Cares. >Why are you fuming over it? Nah mate, I'm not fuming over anything. I'm just stating my opinion which happens to be different from yours. And you're not mature enough to take it and resorted to personal attacks That’s Indians buddy, humara dimaag insta tak hi rahega I don’t think they should worry about Dolly chaiwala being more famous. That not how a sports person success will be judged. Who even is dolly? I wasn't debating your opinion anyways, I just mentioned a commonly observed fact of our society. I didn't utter a single word against you, wdym personal attacks lol? True That's because people recognize him. They don't recognize you. Simple. A chaiwala who got famous Gk ke questions m dolly chai waala nahi aayega voh aaayege har saal kayi lakh baache unka naam yaad karege Half of them are bothered by Dolly because he keeps Ambedkar photo with him wherever he goes. I have seen it on Twitter, anti ambedkar people making same sick posts about Dolly. “Same people will shoo them away” is sooo apt. Then it will suddenly be “please respect our privacy”, “we don’t like to be disturbed”, “It’s okay to be rude to fans, you can’t expect us to be polite all the time” etc. I think we should all let this celebrity culture die across the board. A lot of these people treat common people like vermin. Just ignore them and do your thing, they’ll come back to earth pretty soon. On point Haan lekin wo aisa kyu expect krra tha jaise ki log line lagakr uski photo lenge. 💀😂 Means a teaseller right? How are random people getting so famous Those engineers should direct their hate to another tea seller not him. How was the interaction? Who is this Dolly Chaiwala now? I feel old Heard this name for the first time. agla PM mil gya guys! well some chaiwalas did make it pretty big he might be the next in line Jitna dikhta hai , utna hota nahi hai ....they have \" char din ki Chandni \" wala fame ...ye thoda zyada ho gaya bil gates ki vjh se ....but kachcha badam , ranu mandal ye jo log , jitni jaldi viral hote hein ...itni jaldi gayab bhi ....worst part about this ke inn logon ko idea bhi nahi hota , Inka paisa bhot zyada par Kam waqt ka hai ....jaise 3 maheene ke liye ya 6 maheene ke liye viral gaye ,to usse saal - do saal tak public appearance karke kama skte hei ...uske baad le de ke kabhi ( by chance kuchh mil gaya ) ....isss short period me kamana or bachana hota hai ....but these people started thinking like themselves as starts or paisa kharch karna shuru karte hein ....at the end the sensible one is only person who use benefits in right way ..... social media pe inki kamayi ke examples to dikh jate hein , ek ke baad ek vo viral hoke itna kama Raha hai ...but uske baad kya hota hai.... yahi log line laga kar uski lenge agar trend nikla toh jab bhi reddit pe ata hu pata chalta hai ki deshwashi kitne chuthiye hai log kya sochenge 2nd hand embarrassment I'd pick dolly over entire bolly trash any day. He reminds me of good old days of 90s when Govinda, Nana, asrani, paresh, kader and razakbhai aka faiyaz takkar and their peers ruled. Well, the downfall beings! That's very extreme n miniscule ppl. There are always sick ppl but their count is too low. Many ppl don't even know that he belongs to sc community. They talked about hockey How are you so sure about Individual entitlement and offended part here? For me it's like no one recognized player who played for India because it's not popular like cricket. He had some expectations from his country and feeling sad. I am sure player feeling would be same if some cricketer was there in place of that Chaiwala. It's indeed sad reality of the fake world of social media. I have no issue with Chaiwala or his fans but I am sad theses days people have different priority. Everyone should become like Dolly Chaiwala and his fans and ignore things that matter in real life and for the country. When you see them peoples running for selfies for some viral clipper,you should feel happy,there’s really less competition in the world. It wouldn't have made news or a topic of discussion if it was a cricketer or a Ratan Tata. Heck I doubt the player would've made a fuss at all if that was the case, just like you assumed he would've. Sorry, how does hockey or cricket matter in real life over Dolly Chaiwala? Both categories are just entertainment. Same goes for older generation 'cricket stars' - out of sight, out of mind. My BIL and I once saw Srinath enjoying a buffet at a hotel's where we were staying. Hardly anyone bothered him till my BIL walked up to him and chatted him up. No selfies, no nothing. You didn't get the point, seems to be Dolly Chaiwala fan. Its okay. Lol so much saltiness. Wonder if he would’ve had the same problem if it was Modi, Tata or some actor or cricketer who were given the same attention while ignoring him. Dolly has worked hard and has developed his own fanbase and he’s not even been in any scam afaik I am completely out of loop. Who is this dolly chaiwala Yeah, this Guy is a self deprecating meme made famous by Bill Gates and the internet just for shits and giggles. I bet his chai isn't anything special either.. kal ko koi Suit boot pehennewala doodhwala aayega and the internet will forget this guy even existed. So let him enjoy his 5 min of fame while it lasts. No cricket?? damn.. Recognition comes easy for the loud and shallow, while those who truly build the nation are left with silence and disrespect. Exactly. I can't understand the problem people have with dolly, he's minding his own business. There are so many other popular guys doing shady shit, why every one behind dolly? He's a tea seller who was popular on tiktok for his unique tea making style, his fame grew multifold when bill gates met hun whats wrong with this? This chaiwala can be our next PM, our current PM was no different…. >celebrity like Elvish Yadav bud he is a fucking criminal Again what the f is a dolly chaiwala. I suppose if this had happened to some cricketer, people might rethink how addicted to social media they have become. In this case the hockey player. Not fan or anything. But i get where this whole thing is going.. you didn't get the point, seems to be a Dolly Chaiwala hater and mainstream celebrity worshipper. You assume, I can assume too I guess most people see a chaiwala and think that such people should be beneath them. Yep, a mainstream celebrity nonetheless like Sallu, Sanju, etc If you didn't know,dolly chaiwala charges 500rs for a selfie btw. Bruh what did you guys do for PR. Ye blame game band karo. I love the sense that prevailed in the comments section. Chefs kiss becasue hockey is not that famous , i dont understand how its national game , fans always share cricket related news and its players doesn't matter if its opposition or own's country if i ask someone , who is your favourite cricketer , they will say , dhoni , sachin , kapil dev , virat , rohit but if we ask who is their favourite hockey player , no one will answer or maybe 1 or 2 might answer the question , no media cover them , media themself is crazy about cricket, People should understand that he is a real life cartoon. He is constantly in acting mode whenever he makes a public appearance. He is dressing up like a clown every time he steps outside his house. Being dolly chai walla is hard. His fashion should be on point every single time he steps outside It's more easy for the average person to recognise a cartoon instead of a sportsperson who rarely comes on TV or YouTube We live in a social media world right now and everyone is glued to their phones. It’s because chai waale hi aage chalkar desh chala rahe hai 😂 People think he got overnight fame last year ,nobody knows about his past struggles definetly agree on this , people troll him and all ,but they dont know about his struggle search on YT lmao fan base 💀 search on YT By that logic it's better the country doesn't expect any medals either from them. You can be happy that way. Get it? You dont need achievements to become famous Star 🤡 People are idiots to make anyone star, like what's his talent? He licks the pouring milk while making tea. 🤮 I assumed because you first assumed that hockey player being salty, offended but you didn't assumed that he could be just sad that no one recognized a National player who plays for country. You didn't assumed that he could be happy if some people also recognized him along with Dolly Chaiwala. I am here like who is Dolly Chaiwala I mean I will, but there was a time I didn’t had to search pop culture references, I just knew them 🥲 abhi to I dont even recognise one influencer Its okay You know people are RETARDED, just saw sector 36 and I feel like shit. Nothing will ever change in India. Distribution of 1 bottle is enough to gain votes here. Im so done with this country and feels like I’m hopeless People think that these people are real influencers... Degrading and disrespectful society Did you also get beat up by the hockey team too at the McDonalds? Lol, love the Chak De India reference This is peaceful actually. The right way. Respect them but no hero worshipping. Same should be for cricket and dolly molly chaiwala The hate against him is forced fr. He does do some weird shit like tounging milk while pouring but nothing that bad that deserves this much hate. This is status of India Nowadays I guess chapri's are getting fame while those who really work hard make India proud internationally are getting sidelined sad reality... It's simple that he is more famous than hockey players because in India: 1. First of all hockey is not a popular sport. So the players are also not popular if compared to any IPL Cricketer who doesn't even play in the ICC World Cup. 2. He is famous because of Bill Gates and has some social influence compared to the players I literally thought you were making fun of the chakde India scene Nice ! Because indians mainly respect people with money He invested in a PR team for this. Itna toh ROI he deserves He tried to, but the coach just dismissed him by saying \"humare hockey mein chakke nahin hote\" Seeing this makes me wonder how insecure the film \"stars\" must feel, that they are not so special after all and how easily people can make any tom, dick and harry famous. The coach was mesmerised by the incident Comparison is the thief of Joy Back to back Olympics medal la diy, orr kya chahiye?? Last 10 saal me kitne WC mile the cricket me, jaha sirf 4-5 teams hi relevant hain? No, it's true. McDonald's at Gopalan Arcade, RR Nagar is very close to Sports authority of India facility. You can also see Indian athletes at metro station. Why does the above incident reminds one of Chak De India movie fight sequence which was shot at McDonald's Delhi Ek chhakke ne world cup nhi jitaya 😤 People need to understand difference between an athlete and a clown. 🤡 Name 4 ISRO scientists? Leave it. Who were the leaders behind Chandrayaan-3 project. There's always some chaiwala for footage. This is the reality. There are so many videos of general celebrities behaving rudely to fans who wanted an autograph or photo with them. Why should people take the chance of being disrespected depending on their mood? Social media stars on the other hand are more approachable because their entire brand depends on people continuing to talk about them. Dolly has a good pr team. If he had a bad one or none at all then he would have disappeared after the bill gates incident but is still relevant because of his pr team. The hockey player should have one too if he wants people to recognise him That’s cool I believe he's popular on Instagram not YouTube Bhai , he met bill gates 💀 Welcome to reality. The person who made our INDIA proud is being ignored and some random chai wala is given more importance. Where are we going as a Nation?? Every individual should ask this question to themselves. Yeah , on Instagram ✔ On YT he has 2 million subscribers 💀 These hockey heroes will feel thankful no paparazzi chased away their peace of mind. Toh tu chala jata airport. It's a testament to the power of fame. A sportsman shouldn't be caring about who notices them or not He is the Main character Don't understand why you got downvoted. Not like he is gaining unfair fame at the expense of hockey players! Apart from congratulating them on their medals I don't think people should go gung-ho on any sportsperson. Respect them for their work. There's no reason to swoon over them as long as they are duly compensated for their work. From my POV, a cricket/hockey player's work is as valuable as the person who just sweeped my street. I thought OP was referring to Chak De as well Technology is double edged sword.. Cons of social media overuse 🤦🤦🤦 Ok, let's be clear you're a hockey player so what? You're also a human. I met so many rich people, politicians etc., never asked for a pic or selfie it's not like that selfie would make any difference. You should be happy you're getting privacy unlike other celebs whose personal life is exposed online and being scrutinized every second. He just pours it in the glass from a height of about 2 feet and swirls the glass while giving it to you in such a way that you feel that tea will spill on you but it does not. Nothing special imo. Only Cirket saar jabtap is desh me cinema hai… 2 chakkon ne jitaya 👌🏻 He was famous before that. He got to make tea for Bill gates because he was famous. Colour of his chai golden People are jealous of dolly chaiwala. The same fans get berated for bothering them and not giving them privacy Sorry but , why are you complaining, if you want more people to recognise you then perform better, For eg in 2021 more people in the US would have recognised Logan Paul compared to say Noah lyles, but now In 2024 almost everybody knows him there why? Won the gold in the olympics, he's winning the championships getting in the news continuously!! This people are doomed Famous hote bewakoof, toh asli bewakoof kon?? I didn't assume Hockey Player is salty. Its a fact that he is salty. He is salty because he thinks he also deserves fame. He is not entitled to it.. He maybe a national player, so what? I did some things and work in my niche field which is revolutionary or first time in the country, but I don't expect fame, because outside of my field of work, nobody cares. Same thing for this, a state level or an aspiring Indian hockey player may recognise Hardik. But you can't expect others. I don't know most cricketers playing for India except Virat Kohli, because media keeps shoving his face, but others i dont know, nor do i care. Similarly, Dolly's famous for whatever reason, and people want to be clicked with him, too bad for Hardik. Is Hardik recognized otherwise? Somebody here commented that Indian team was at a KFC and nobody recognized them. Life is unfair. No need to bring down Dolly just because somebody thinks somebody else also deserves fame. Toronto Maple Leafs Buhu hame limelight do Instagram* . Tiktok is banned in India this is the most indian thing i've heard Hockey is our national sport right? 2 din ki chaandni hai kitne aate hai kitne jaate hai Hockey walo ki koi izzat nahi hai mei hota toh mei bhi ignore hi karta chutiyo ko Can anyone tell me how dolly folly can influence someone and why he is getting paid for doing all chapri giri ?? Dolly is a fad, will go away sooner than the shine of those medals. I hope our hockey players don’t get disheartened by these incidents. This is such poor form to complain about \"Why is X more famous than I am?\" Not exactly the humility you'd expect from role models. Go fight for more funding, more facilities, and more promotion of the sport. It's embarrassing for him to fight for recognition in a train station. No they don't care, their awkwardness was because of the state of the society we live in where these so-called influencers and chapri chaiwallas are more famous than the National team of the National sport. They were implying that the the state of Sports in India is so abysmal that we being a nation of a billion people cannot win even 10 Olympic medals, and sports people don't get the respect they deserve even after portraying excellence in their field. A majority of people in this country care more about a random filmstar than an Olympic gold medalist from this country. A reflection of today's society where optics and marketing yourself sell more than talent, merit and simplicity. Everything we do be it careers, food, vacation, relationships, weddings, even health & fitness have to be insta-worthy. Those old days were trash tier too Not to forget the ones who actually make celebrities are us, if we ever collectively stopped giving a F about them then they would be devastated lol A lot of narcissists really like the attention they get from celebrity worship If those followers of his could [read your comment](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/243100573/If-those-kids-could-read-theyd-be-very-upset) they'd be very upset Agree with you.. but India has no national sport. The Constitution doesn't mention any specific name. Indian social media in a nutshell. Just make cricket national sport so that hockey players can stop complaining and bickering Brother! In India you have to expect the unexpected, things are upside down in India , it is a sad reality. New India Who is Dolly Chaiwallah? Why is he famous? In any of my comments I didn't say bad about Dolly Chaiwala, it's you who is offended because you think I should praise Dolly Chaiwala wala. And accept that hockey player is salty. Again you are not a getting a simple point that there's nothing wrong in comparison. You are assuming that player thinks negative about Chaiwala. He just thinks that playing sports for country is more important than earning money by selling chai. It's a double whammy of Indians being unaware of their Olympics champions and being over-interested in chaiwalas. Sports is mostly meaningful if there is a following. Otherwise it's just a game that you are good at. It's awkward because on one hand they were celebrating hard a few days ago for bagging a medal for their country through their lifetime efforts. On the other, the people of the country don't really care. They know this but ignore it and persevere. But sometimes reality hits hard in the face. >National team of the National sport There is no national sport. >where these so-called influencers and chapri chaiwallas are more famous than the National team of the National sport. They were implying that the the state of Sports And. People of almost all the nations will recognise people who are constantly in a type of media over sports stars of sports that most people don't follow (especially if it's a team sport). The way you described it actually feels impressive For a thing to be 'National' it does not necessarily have to be present in the Constitution. It just has to be present for the 'National' pride. For example, 'We are Indians, we love tigers and peacocks and we play hockey and kabbaddi'. 'We are Americans, we love playing football (their version) and baseball and shooting and owning guns are our right'. From the perspective of governments it is an integral part of nation building for it's citizens to feel connected to something tangible. FYI I also think it's a stupid concept; in the age of globalization and diversification of subjects national pride means shit. However it does have its utilities, key of them is to instill a sense of patriotism in people who have no guiding philosophy in their life to begin with. If I was an olympic medalist and still got to keep my privacy in public, I'd see that as a win Cause hockey is not a sport that a lot of people follow in India. It would be the similar case in a lot of footballers, basketballers, etc.. people won't remember full members of a team sport if that sport is not that famous. At the expense of Indian taxpayer? Sure. And hockey is not a favourite sport in India. So chances are that a majority of people here won't even recognise the most important hockey player of the team currently. Mate, you are just exposing yourself with these comments. Thank you Modi ji for making all of this possible. /s You know where our nation is heading towards! National sports do exist, just not on paper. Regarding media, it's actually the opposite. Media is a product, a projection of society, not the other way round. If the majority of society has nothing to do with sports, or even basic fitness (see the health and fitness levels of our previous generation) they will not respect the grit and skills required to excel in sports. It will literally make them feel inadequate. So the media, masters in psychological manipulation, will never give them enough coverage. In the end they are businesses. If the majority of society want to see an uneducated 'chaiwalla' over our sports people who have dedicated years of their life excelling in their field, it is a commentary on the kind of society we live in, not the businesses that cater to them. TLDR; society chhapri so media displays chhapri people. Society fit so media will display excellence. More on national sports from a previous reply: For a thing to be 'National' it does not necessarily have to be present in the Constitution. It just has to be present for the 'National' pride. For example, 'We are Indians, we love tigers and peacocks and we play hockey and kabbaddi'. 'We are Americans, we love playing football (their version) and baseball and shooting and owning guns are our right'. From the perspective of governments it is an integral part of nation building for it's citizens to feel connected to something tangible. FYI I also think it's a stupid concept; in the age of globalization and diversification of subjects national pride means shit. However it does have its utilities, key of them is to instill a sense of patriotism in people who have no guiding philosophy in their life to begin with. >National sports do exist, just not on paper. Just because some people say it doesn't mean it's a national sport. It has to be identified by the country for that status. >want to see an uneducated 'chaiwalla' over our sports people who have dedicated years of their life excelling in their field It depends on what sport. If it was a cricketer who played for the national team, he would be recognised as they are constantly in the media. If it was some famous movie stars, they would also be recognised. If it was Tata or Ambani, they would also be recognised. So it simply depends on the media. The basketball players of our country also dedicate their whole life to sport but I am sure that 99 percent (even more actually) won't be able to even name a single player. Can you yourself name the current basketball team without looking it up? Can you name our rugby team? If yes. Good and impressed. >TLDR; society chhapri so media displays chhapri people. Society fit so media will display excellence. It would be the same for almost every country though. The people in media would be recognised more over people who are playing not so famous sports (especially in team sports). And finally, it's not like Dolly chaiwala became an overnight success. He too worked hard to reach here and there is only one dolly like that. Gordon Ramsay would be recognised over a lot of sports people in the UK, US, etc.. doesn't mean that's bad. We love to play cricket and watch cricket more though. Has been the case for years now. Doesn't make it the national sport of india. So for it to be recognised as a national sport, it indeed has to be specified by the government. >No they don't care, their awkwardness was because of the state of the society we live in where these so-called influencers and chapri chaiwallas are more famous than the National team of the National sport. Lol. Look at yourself too, you are normalising a casteist slur \"Chapri\" and complaining about the society which you are a part of. If there's a bollywood star in place of Dolly the same hockey players wouldn't even comment anything. RR nagar Assemble 😂 all the Jain college boys too. Judging by the quality of your reply you haven't understood anything that I've written. I was talking about how the workings of media houses displays the quality of societies in EVERY country. Also are you seriously comparing Gordon Ramsay to Dolly Chaiwalla?🤣 Sadly, in our country, the only game worshipped is cricket and cricketers. Rest all sports are null and void Brand ambassador of Microsoft Windows 12 Sure whtever u say Bhai attention seek kroge to kheloge kaise, apne kaam pe dhyaan do aur log fir tumpe dhyaan denge. Sometimes you need proper space See the podcast and read the article which is based on the podcast. Yeh mamla gambhir hota dhikraha hai Frickin' Anti-nationals /s But it's very common I. South like Kerala My 2 India Can't blame. They are not influencers who is famous. >common people like vermin A lot of celebrities are indeed very entitled, and do believe that their time and convenience is far more valuable than that of others, so you're not right about that But sometimes people conflate a famous person not wanting to take a selfie (and no that's not a part of their job description), with them being rude, which is not usually the case. If a famous person doesn't want to interact with strangers and conveys the same with common courtesy, then they're fully in the right A person can easily feel the difference between these two cases. For instance, my dad met Sachin and Supriya Pilgaonkar, and while they didn’t want to get pictures clicked, they were super sweet and polite to him, and chatted with him a bit after dad told them about how our family watches their movies together, and are all big fans. We’ve thankfully never encountered a bad celebrity, but sometimes you can just feel the hostility, arrogance, and superiority coming off of somebody. I feel that especially with double-faced celebrities who act in an attention-seeking way and then complain about how everyone’s obsessed with them. Like, they conflate their own importance to feel superior to others. I have seen L Balaji and D Karthik at the airport. Not many people recognized them and attended to take photo. I was able to take one with Karthik. I think it’s more to do with the popularity and how many people are aware of a person. Even in Cricket, majority may not be able to recognize all of them until the player is popular except the playing eleven. Can’t believe our generation is getting excited by seeing dolly chai wala. And what’s this stupid trend of capturing pics at airports? It’s so sick. And again dolly chai wala is no one to be hyped about. Kal election ladne gya toh log isko vote denge? Yeah, these are people who've built their career on their uncommon athleticism, artistic talent or good looks, of-course of they have huge egos. Some of them are just are better at masking it in public Also, outside of a few people who probably already have a reputation for being assholes, most celebs don't actually do what you described. They might be curt to, or ignore a stranger that approached them out of nowhere, but that's less them putting others down, and more just them wanting to be left alone Again, as a fan, you're not in any way entitled to their time, unless you actually paid for a meet and greet (or something else of the sort). A lot of celebrities just indulge their fans, because it's better for their reputation, and by extension careers. But again, that's not a part of their job Bro first of all I don’t feel entitled to anyone’s time. I haven’t asked any celeb for an autograph in my life except Gulzaar Sahab. Secondly, there are some genuinely nice people who are celebrities, who are happy to speak to you and interact with you. No ego, no pretence. And then there’s genuine assholes. I know a very mainstream indie Indian singer who broke out pretty big in the last 4-5 years, and he’s a garbage person. Nothing about his personal life or time or privacy is the reason behind his behaviour. He’s just a piece of shit human being who uses his fans for sex, scoring drugs, getting gigs, and then ditches them. He’ll show up 2 hours late for a concert and will be wasted half the time. He displays the same shit personality at every place. People like that are indefensible. >nice people who are celebrities, who are happy to speak to you and interact with you >No ego, no pretence. Those things can very much be mutually exclusive. As I said, some people see public interaction as valuable to their brand, and thus are quite generous to their fans. That doesn't mean they can't also be egotistical assholes In fact, whenever a story about an actor being an awful person breaks, some of the first comments are usually fans saying something to the effect of \"but he was so nice that one time 12 years ago\" >broke out pretty big in the last 4-5 years, and he’s a garbage person. \"Scumbag gets fame, immediately exploits said fame, and becomes increasingly unprofessional\". Yeah, that happens too, quite a lot in fact. But isn't that a different conversation entirely? We were talking about whether ignoring fans who approach you in public, is inappropriate, which is clearly not the central issue with the dude you mentioned Excuse me chaiwalas are of highest importance as per Indian culture. Dolly is saving lives every day. Did You Use a casteist slur to make India proud too? Then what term will i use for these guys tell me uneducated or something... It’s their fault. They should have made reels and tiktoks instead of wasting their time on playing olympics for country. If you need popularity and recognition in India, you gotta dumb down to the level of general population. After all, we are a country who votes based on caste and religion in 2024. Who tf even watches Hockey? They had like 15 players squad. Not everyone know every players. OTOH Dolly is on the fees back to back reels . Olympics are just overhyped games. Jio manipulated statistics by adding cumulative views. Otherwise only less than 1 crores had watched this Olympics. I mean this just goes to show no one is someone anyway. Keep your head down and focus on your journey. Fame is cheap, it comes and goes. Feeling awkward because no one recognized you is some next level narcissism. Who cares that no one recognized you? You're still Olympic level athletes, why does it matter? Why do you need someone else to tell you who tf you are lol People gonna forget him. Focus on your goals I think they're hoping that in future this selfie turns out to be a selfie with the PM Ye hoti hai chaiwale ki taka!! I have seen the legendary Dhanraj Pillay walk alone inside Mumbai airport when in parallel people were flocking some random tv actors for selfies. Where are we going as a society? Ab ye dolly chai wala kaun hai? Haa bhai chutiyo ko zyada value hai iss time mei As an American, you are completely right. Who the hell is Dolly Chaiwala? I feel blessed to not know most of these social media caricatures. We're collectively doomed as a society for this. He is basically trying to copy salt bae. If I remember, salt bae was famous, exactly for the same reason. Instagram. is. a. mistake. That’s not how their SPORTS career will be judged, but these guys will never get big brand deals if no one recognizes their faces so their FINANCIAL success is absolutely affected Who's this dolly chaiwala? Except real chaiwalas never become PM. There's no record of him of selling tea according to people acquainted with the train station he claims to have worked in. Worse there are school pictures of him in attire that would suggest he was upper middle class or above. Few even claim that set of photos is from doon, lowkey famous for schooling kids of top elite class. lol as if the common masses in the West care for Bernie or Cobryn I had respect for this guy till recently… he has hustled for years and years before shooting into the limelight but now he is just scamming his followers by promoting scammy and shady gambling/trading apps and platforms - sad to see that really. A lot of his followers are on the younger side and mostly lower-middle class folks and are likely to fall in this trap. Last I checked I was blocked on his Insta on my personal handle 🤣🤣 To be honest, the faces that people see all the time have better recognization when they go outside. The ones who are popular and are recognized in their own domain do not really have their faces projected everywhere so they cannot be recognized. Also these celebrities have unique faces that are instantly recognized when they go out. Cricketers are well recognized/recall because of TV and advertisements. Same can be said for some olympic medal winners. But for hockey players how many times were they shown on TV screens? Face recall is very important if they want to be recognized when they go out. They need a PR team to project their faces on giant billboards, TV screens, youtube shorts, insta, and everywhere else. This is like saying \"everyone know who is foreigner bill gates but they dont know who is indian millionaire, founder of Cafe Coffee Day. No he has been doing this 2010 there's a video it on Yt and he has also said in a interview that he took inspiration for this style from Rajnikanth. I think hockey players thought that they were entitled to special treatment but didn't receive it. Obviously, when expectations fail it hurts but I think that should be the attitude of general public for most of the folks and things. And of course, Dolly met Bill. Not a single player has ever met any billionaire of our country so it is understood who has become more famous on social media and whom people recognise. Ask what exactly? Do you know how many sports there are in India? How many Olympic sports, and how many people work tirelessly to \"make india proud\". Do you know and remember all of them? Do you think it would be the same case if the Indian cricket team was there? No right. Why is cricket so famous? Because they spent time and money to advertise themselves, they changed with the time by introducing T20, the recent popularity of kabbadi is again because they learned that prompting the spot is important. What coverage does hockey get for anyone not already a fan of hockey? A passing remark in the media? Why would any new person be interested in watching it? There is no question to ask for the average person or sports viewer, they have their interests and they are happy. If you want your sport to be their interest do something about it. Sums up the indian society. Frankly I may not be aware of hocky, thats because I dont watch sports, but I sure as hell wont be hyping this clown chai guy up. I fucking hate what we have become. Everyone wants to be a tiktok or instagram star. one cup chai Is it really his fault?like PPL are gonna come after me but we have already made the wrong guys famous. Same hockey team that were happy to just qualify for olympics and then left? ...Don't know any of them... That's more indicative of how badly the Hockey side markets themselves to Indians. Many of them probably are grateful. They just can't live a normal life with crowds of fans following them everywhere. He has a rose royal man He’s still famous and earned his money and fame Ise he kahte h buddhi ka ghotala jo aam logo ke saath ho raha h. Chaiwala, selfi n all bulshit.... Who you recognize in public depends on your field of interest. If the hockey team had been on the same flight as Dinesh Kumar Khara and Dr. Rajiv Bahl, I doubt they would have these gentlemen either. lmfaoooooo Hardik Rai is genuinely a good guy, I have mutual friends with him and the guy must have shared his honest opinion,he is far from hatred & jealousy.tbh he must have been making a point about Hockey players not getting the recognition they deserve Bruh, 90s bollywood really? It's all about visibility. People and media focus on hockey once in 4 years and hence, they might also not be familiar with line ups and individual players. Most people might not even know what position Hardik plays in. Besides, Hockey is a fast paced sport, which makes it difficult to focus on each player and for people to recognize by just faces unless they follow regularly. To the people complaining about non-performance, our Hockey teams are literally one of our best performing teams and are medal contenders and consistently producing results since last few years. One of the best teams in the world now. How is it that Indian footballers are more popular than Hockey players despite being mediocre at world level? Because it's not about performance, it's about visibility, coverage and fan culture which also exists in Indian hockey but not as much as Indian football or cricket. Secondly, cricket and football have a league which fans follow regularly which Indian hockey doesn't at this point. I am sure the upcoming Hockey India League at the end of the year would bring some recognition and private investment towards hockey. To solve this issue of people only focusing on hockey once in 4 years and bringing hockey the attention it deserves, we created r/Indianfieldhockey so that more people regularly follow this beautiful sport of ours. we Indian love kirket! 😆 🤣 churket !! Investment in sports is investment in youth Hardik didn't have any problem with Dolly, he just shared his experience as asked by the interviewer. Hardik didn't have any problem with Dolly, he just shared his experience as asked by the interviewer. India doesn't have a national sport He was asked by the interviewer and he answered accordingly. He just shared his experience. Why do you feel he is complaining? How about actually following Hockey instead of sitting on cricket? You don't need to demean one to appreciate another. India doesn't have a national sport How about actually following Hockey instead of sitting on cricket? You don't need to demean one to appreciate another. Irrelevant to the comment being discussed. Role models encourage and inspire people to te up sports. Why do you think Hockey India has marketing team and social media handles? If some kid gets encouraged to pursue hockey after seeing the achievement, fame and love someone like Sreejesh, Hardik or Harmanpreet (Sarpanch) gets, it does help in development of hockey and spreading sports. Given how good our national teams are performing and being managed, Hockey India needs to do a better job to market them. Hoping that the upcoming Hockey India League this year would bring much needed recognition and private investment into the sport as well as competitive gametime which would increase our player pool. Sad state of our country!! 😒 Looks like chai wallahs get crazy for photo ops as soon as they get famous. \"Some\" of them will start putting photos on trains and hoardings one of these days.
