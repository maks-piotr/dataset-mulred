        "If anyone is a fan of the Half Life and Portal franchise, I implore you to play Entropy : Zero 2 on Steam. It's a very high quality mod and is free to play. The quality of the game play and writing is definitely up there, even better than Half Life 2 : Episode 1 in my books.",

        "Gaming does not feel as fun anymore to me.\nGrowing up makes you boring I guess.\n\nAnyway, I am an avid Apex player.\nIf there’s someone who’d like to play, hmu.",
        "I am playing Identity V and Genshin Impact. \n\nThe first is a Dead by Daylight like asymmetrical game, but a lot less scary and much more competitive. I am excited for an upcoming skin for the Indian cricketer character. His name is Ganji Gupta and he is a very strong and highly loved and frequently played character which makes me proud. He is based off of Aamir Khan's character in Lagaan.\n\nGenshin Impact is a very popular single player free to play open world adventure game. Recently, they released a new region based on India called Sumeru (also based on Persia and Arabia, but the current past that is released is the Indian inspired one).

        "Holy shit, this looks really damm cool. A question if you don't mind me asking, how do you guys find out such cool games on steam ? this one totally flew under my radar and im very active on steam. Also if you like half life and deus ex then check out this game called E.Y.E. divine cybermancy. Its a little weird game, super janky and certainly not for everyone but if it clicks then its quite fun.",

        "I just came across it on the Steam top sellers list and saw that it had overwhelmingly positive reviews. Was a bit unsure about downloading it at first because I've not had a great experience with mods outside of  checking out stuff that looked cool, but this one completely surprised me. I can't believe that a mod that has 8 hours of game play, original writing, music and voice acting is FREE."
