        "Indian judges have 7 months of vacation - they work 8 hours on regular days and then have 7 months of vacation",
        "Are you serious!? Why thought?",

        "Let me answer this being a first-hand victim of this nonsense.  \n\nSo, my dad was arrested for some crap some ppl filed against him and his brother. Well, the brother went 'missing', and they got my dad. My 69yro dad had to go spend almost 2 yrs in local jail. It took 2 years and about 20lakhs in bribe to even get his file on top of the bundle for the allahbad high court Judge to even glance at. \n\nWhatever the fkn case is idc but the fact that it takes all that long and $ to even be heard is the part why everyone languishes. \n\nThe kicker is if any senior citizens have special spot in the judiciary to be heard first given their age. It's like little relaxation the govtprovides . \n\nAt first it took months to even get a date in the lower (local) court because we had to grease the palms of the guard who got us to a lawyer who got us to the tehsildaar who then got us to DM who took us to mulayam singh. That's how far and up we had to go. All this for a classic land grab case. Dad owned it and local mla's buddies wanted 2ecres to open a 'resort' . None of it happened because we took everyone to court. First of all the judges in lower sessions and high court, incl delhi, won't show up to work. Even the senior judges work from 10am-12noon, and then they literally leave. Add to that the corruption which starts the minute you actually want justice. Fuk this. I'm glad we're not in India anymore. We all migrated. \n\nWould we dot it again? No.",
        "We have less judges per capita and the limited judges we have are on holidays most of the time.",
        "No they don't, don't spread misinformation. The majority of judges are at the lower level where they don't get anything more than two weeks and work for 6 days a week throughout the year, you arsehole.",
        "Exactly! It breaks my heart to hear your story. I'm sure there are many thousands of people with the same story out there. \n\nMy problem is no one here talks about this. And that's the real tragedy.",
        "I do know about the low strength of judges per unit population compared to better countries in terms of judiciary. \n\nMy question is why is something not being done about it!?",
        "A district court judge in Kerala once told - we are lucky to get a good stenographer, only a few courts have them.They are used to record court proceedings for the benefit of everyone. \n\nWe lack everything - from judges, to police, to forensic examiners - both techological and medical, to court employees etc. And its not just judiciary. We lack traffic police, bureaucrats, government servants everyone. India's problem is its absolutely small and miniscule government workers.",
        "Number of judges and their working time in the year are way too less\n\nEspecially HC and honorable SC\nAdd to that lawyers wanting to extend hearings so that they keep getting paid\n\nIt is a complete mess.",
        "My take, we've become too comfortable with our material lives. And become afraid of pissing off the wrong people or not wanting to go to the cops or the legal route in fear of losing our precious lives. Because the people in power haven't felt the consequences of their actions for so long, it's led to this massive power imbalance. If we'd kept them on their toes all along, wouldn't have been the case. ü§î",
        "Exactly! Then shouldn't this be talked about this more! I barely see this as even a topic of discussion in India.",
        "Completely agree!",
        "We are running the judiciary on one third of the judges that we actually need. Each judge is so overburdened that they can't properly decide the case if they ever hope to clear their case load.\n\nThe government is not interested in recruitment because they know that they would get in serious trouble if the judiciary was even running half strength. A lot of the corruption in our country is enabled by the fact that the people in power know that even if they are sued, it will take an immense amount of time for anything to happen.\n\nThere's also the corruption in the judiciary itself. You don't make much money as a judge, and often you'll be posted to some far off area in the middle of nowhere. A significant minority of judges take bribes. However, most judges just try and do their job without getting into trouble. Judges who try and get too aggressive often get taken care of, especially in the lower courts.\n\nThe answer would be that currently, no one wants the judiciary to improve. Lawyers and court support staff (registry and all) are able to earn their living only because the courts are slow. And I'm saying that applies when they're working completely honestly. 70% of lawyers in our country basically facilitate things in court, they've never argued a case. The government doesn't want a functional judiciary because the judiciary is a check on their power, and who wants that? They also have the advantage of being the organisation that has to recruit the judges, so they just don't. Additionally, the police also don't want an effective judiciary because that will cause problems for them when they do illegal shit or don't work properly... Which they do very often.\n\nDo you see, how no one really wants things to get better? Half the people on here are idiots saying judges go on vacations and don't work, when the reality is that most judges are so overworked they often don't see their children awake. But they are also easy targets, as compared to confronting the despair which is knowing that no one wants to really improve the judiciary, because even a properly staffed judiciary would be a catastrophic problem for the people in power.\n\nYou can also read this:\nhttps://www.livelaw.in/lawschool/articles/judicial-efficiency-beyond-working-hours-and-vacations-supreme-court-258847#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20judges%20work%20just,such%20as%20bail%2C%20eviction%20etc.",
        "Dude that's so much trash. Most judges are handling multiple benches at a time, and hence cannot stay at the same bench for too long. Please educate yourself.",
        "So while all the shit is happening in the country including kejrival case and neet one where is cji? Why hasn't the review petition of pmla heard yet? What about the money bill case?",
        "The court closes for two weeks during this period. Even then matters are being heard by vacation benches. As for what the CJI is doing, you can actually see that because he made it mandatory for every court to broadcast their hearings online. Go and attend court for one single day, and then say that they are not working.\n\nPlease read this article, if you really wish to educate yourself:\nhttps://www.livelaw.in/lawschool/articles/judicial-efficiency-beyond-working-hours-and-vacations-supreme-court-258847#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20judges%20work%20just,such%20as%20bail%2C%20eviction%20etc.",

        "It's a very complex problem. As a single citizen, the only thing you can do is try to become a judge and help out those you can. Many people become judges with that intention,, but the job burns out even the best of us.\n\nThe problem needs to be addressed root and stem. As a country we need to elect leaders on the basis of real issues instead of religious and caste lines. Consider this. An issue this pivotal, which affects one entire pillar of our democracy, has never been brought up by a single party.\n\nTry and remember the last time a party said they will work on recruitment of judges. It is just not important enough for them to even care.\n\nSolving a problem like this is the work of decades and multiple generations. We will have to vote for the parties that talk about real issues. Once we force all parties to stop talking about religion and caste and start talking about we get them to start working on the issues instead of just talking. You see where this is going? Solving this problem probably entails that you will not live to see the final result, which will probably come in 2090 or something.",
        "No they don't dude. Give me any high court calender which has 7 months of vacation.",
        "Your comment is something I myself could have written it resonates so much with me. \n\nI request you to please bring this issue to light in front of as many people as you can in real life or on social media. \n\nMaybe if enough people talked about it, we could trigger a change.\n\nüôèüèª",
        "I am trying. If you'll see my comment history, I've been wasting my time recently trying to convince and shift people even a little bit towards reasonable beliefs, and failing spectacularly.\n\nIt's a fine line. If you push too hard, people will fight back to protect their beliefs, because changing your beliefs hurts. So you have to find that sweet spot where you educate people without being too patronising or pushy. \n\nA thing I do is I use movies to slowly make them see where they're wrong and what they can do. It is a long process. It took me about 4 years to change the beliefs of three of my friends. Most people on here would abandon those friendships rather than genuinely work on changing their beliefs. It's hard work..but try it. Things like this can have a treble effect, and you never know if you change the beliefs of one pivotal person who brings about a thought revolution.",
        "The real problem is low number of judges per unit population which is pithy compared to countries with stronger judiciaries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa50bvyvnf8d1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84a116c4cfe5101cf36e2d2532e99bb78da8a9b6",
