    "selftext": "\nI recently watched this 36 minute exhaustive and well researched documentary by this YouTube channel called Kamdev where he gives clear evidence and proofs of various bullshit spewed by Sadhguru. His father in law accuses him of murdering his wife too. Just because he is in good books of all politicians and celebrities doesn‚Äôt make him all knowing or good. After also watching the documentary on Osho, I realise how similar he is to him, and despite the world knowing about Osho already, there are still so many people who follow Sadhguru in the similar way. Why do you think we are like this? \n\nFor those interested this is the documentary: https://youtu.be/6tozeaDnki8",

I fucking hate Jaggi. I hate every fucker who prays someone else's religious or spiritual sentiments. Aastha is supposed to be pure. These fuckers and other bull fuckers like RSS/BJP etc. prey on these people. I fucking hate it.",
        "True. I think more people should question themselves when they blindly follow these godmen because of their friends or peer pressure. It‚Äôs a clear red flag when someone who is a human claims to be a form of god themselves. Those who have actually read Bhagavad Gita should realise that all humans are filled with flaws and imperfections whereas god is perfect and absolute, how can a mere human be compared to god.",
        "I don't know anything about sadguru but I am surprised how you declared Osho as fake just by a documentary. Tomorrow I can also make documentary about anyone. Maybe Netflix too may start streaming my documentary made by me but will prove it as an ultimate truth?",
        "I declare all of those fake without watching the documentary.",
        "I don't even follow Osho but just getting this much influenced by a documentary is not something very good",
        "Netflix won't.",
        "I find Sadhguru to be an extremely insidious individual. The limited amount of content of his that I‚Äôve seen kind of convinced me that he‚Äôs full of shit. This is content from his own channels.\n\nHe manages to package regressive thinking and ideas into a progressive and a seemingly intellectual package. I‚Äôm gonna take a look at the documentary in any case. It‚Äôs high time Sadhguru‚Äôs charade is exposed.",
        "People hear what they need to hear.",
        "Its based on the evidences and facts presented in them right. If something is the truth then facts find their way to the surface eventually. He was the head of the cult and if something does happen it‚Äôs unlikely that it would happen without his knowledge. I‚Äôve also read various accounts of crimes committed in his ashram and the main bio terror attack in US.. you could give the documentary (wild wild country) a watch and form your opinion based on it",
        "Definitely watch this documentary by Kamdev where he has done good research and tells us about how Sadhguru got his so called ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù and other shady practices by him like probably killing his own wife",
        "Looking at people like Osho, Sadhguru, Nityananda, even I feel motivated to quit my career and become a godmen..",
        "Compared to SadGuru, Osho was a saint!",
        "Hahah I think you should watch Wild Wild country on Netflix and then let me know if you still have the same opinion..",
        "While I haven‚Äôt seen this documentary, the limited amount of content I‚Äôve seen on his own channels really showed how he isn‚Äôt what he claims to be (intellectual, progressive, benevolent). \n\nYou can clearly see patterns of evasive behavior when asked a posed difficult questions, he wraps the regressive ideas under the guise of progressive thinking. He‚Äôs selective about questions he answers and does it with great skill to make it seem like the people who are asking these tough questions are out to get him (basically plays victim).",
        "For all the anti-west sentiment we see, 'spiritual' and religious Indians who fall for his schtick do so largely because he can speak English fairly well which sets him above from other such charlatans.",
        "Is there a single legitimate Guru lol?\nThey're all fake.\n\nBut why do you say Osho was fake? Guy was weird for sure but he did not make any supernatural claims.\n\nHe has three good videos on YouTube.\n\nOne is where he says there's no God. \nAnother where he says marriage system should be abolished. \nAnd third where he says that people should be given safe space to try drugs but we should change society so that people don't need drugs\n\nOther videos aren't so good. In one he even talks about telepathy.\n\nBut there's no comparison. Jaggi is a complete idiot while Osho was quite well read and used to be a professor of philosophy before turning into a god-man (despite him not believing in God, he called himself Bhagwan (apparently the original meaning has something to do with light))",

        "He might be a great human. No doubt about that. Am not questioning his humanity, am questioning what makes a guru \"real or fake\". He too like Sadhguru or Asharam preaches his religious philosophy and projects himself as \"enlightened\" no?",

        "I understand the intention of OP, and what you‚Äôre trying to convey. However attributing the term ‚Äúsaint‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs in relative or comparative terms seems like you‚Äôre whitewashing all his crimes..",
        "Can you please provide a source for the sexual assaults and rapes? This is the first I'm hearing of it.\n\nWhy do you call him fake tho? Did claim to be something he was not? He was quite open about sexuality so the naked screaming fits the bill. But I've never heard of fighting, could be wrestling or sparring but not like the fight club.\n\nMaa Anand Sheela was responsible for the illegal activities on US soil, Wikipedia says she went behind his back.\n\nHe didn't claim to be a saint of Hinduism or anything. He was against all religions and was expelled from college for his views on religion.",
        "Yeah, I have also had a bitter taste since learning about him using G63 and some expensive Ducati (I think a multistrada) for save the rivers/soil project.\n\nDon't get me wrong I am a car guy myself but I won't be stupid enough to use a vehicle that has a economy in the single digits (even the bike I'm assuming has extremely low economy) and thus far more polluting than other types of vehicles to spread the message of avoiding a different type of pollution.\n\nI seriously feel it's just about him being comfortable and enjoying a drive with his project being just some sort of marketing ploy.",
        "So many comments bashing Sadhguru here but not a single one mentioning what bullshit does he exactly say and do.

        "I have watched it, and its carefully scripted narrative with cleverly hidden evidences, I have been to Isha ashram and I can vouch with my life, you dont have to believe me at the same time you shouldn't beleive a youtube video either just take some effort and explore instead of stupidly making conclusions that are not even right",
        "This is stupid, Sadhguru is the one who always beats down the idea of heave, hell and god and he does not claim to be one either. Followers have made him godlike because the immensity of transformation they have seen in their lifes. and it is a silly idea saying god is everywhere or nowhere, because let me break it to you there is no god, there are no miracles but technologies either you can use it or make stupid conclusions like above",
        "Its like saying aliens doesn't exist, have you searched for a guru? if so how much effort did you put? oh I am sorry i did not consider the fact that you have a mind of a 7 year old",
        "co-cola which is bad for you spends millions of dollars in ads, yoga which is life transforming shouldn't I market it?",
        "As we can't prove the existence of god, we also can't prove the non-existence of god as well. That's why I have added both possibilities.",
        "you proved god, so what about it?",
        "Are people's mind in here so silly, no wonder people here are not able to understand Sadhguru, I am ok with people being idiots, I am ok with people being arrogrant, But I am definitely not ok with people being both. If you are an idiot atleast be humble and try to seek or explore rather than making stupid conclusions",
        "Everyone is free to make choices and opinions. There's no need to belittle anyone for not liking what you like. We can still be civil in disagreement.\n\nYou know, 2 people can have opposite opinions and both can still be intelligent. One doesn't have to be stupid for the other to feel right.\n\nWhat's wrong in not liking Sadhguru? I am not saying that I hate him, I only said that no human should be revered as a god. You can still like and follow what he says, I just don't believe that anyone should consider them as god. Even if someone still prays to him, be my guest. We can agree to disagree. We don't have to be petty about it. It's okay for other to have different opinions.",
        "When did I prove god?\nI just told that I have 2 opposite opinions about god at the same instance.\nI can't believe either. Can I not have that opinion?\nOne doesn't need to have a conclusion all the time, there's nothing wrong in having strong yet inconclusive understanding of something.",
        "woah woah, hold one , the statement you proved god, was rhetorical. I meant to say if you manage to prove god and you are successful , so what about it? if it doesn't in some way leaves you transformed.The idea that Sadhguru thinks himself is ridiculous and false, and you think that his devotees consider him as god, maybe , but do you know why, no but you have made a stupid conclusion that those people are stupid and gullible. Two intelligent men can have different opinion, but having stupid opinions like the above ones doesn't make somebody intelligent but stupid. As I said I am ok with stupidity but people reaffirming their stupid opinions is arrogance and I am not ok with both those qualities in combination.\n\nAnd lastly everyone is free to have opinions but if you try to abuse or put down Sadhguru in any way, shape or form, I will have to put my opinion across in a more jarring way",
        "I never said anything to put him down. I only said that no matter what he would be, he isn't god, because no human is god. I have no issues with anyone, unless someone compares them to god. Not just Sadhguru, I would respect and agree with anyone if they say a right or good thing. Not being a god, doesn't demean anyone. That's as normal as calling them human. And human errs. Unless I say anything derogatory, one mustn't feel offended.",
        "The people who hated osho were politicans, dogmatic religious people who couldn‚Äôt take his criticism of religion, osho was contraversial in a rebellious way because he was the truth.

Those who have eyes to see could clearly pick out the fraud Sadguru. He‚Äôs a liar and a carbon copy NPC. He cares about fortune, he‚Äôs solely a business man who knows how to rip people off, not Osho.",

And it just reinforces and strengthens their confidence in their conning ability. They feel so much confidence because they know how dumb people are, how desparate, and how gullible, and if they say that theyre enlightened and dress the part, and talk the part, most people will believe them, and hand over their money.",

        "What courses these gurus may offer is like a buffet. Eat what suits you, no need to get upset if there are some dishes you don't like. U might wanna eat what u like, and also try a lil of something new, which u think u might like. Applies to both osho, sadhguru & all others. Osho was supposed to have been involved in sex scandals. Don't know too much about him other than this. Sadhguru has been accused of killing his wife, of which he was acquitted. And also that he usurped elephant corridor, and I don't know which that is. If anyone thinks he's a criminal, y not take him to court, instead of believing rumors repeated a thousand times? We r not barred from using our brains. Just coz someone is my guru, doesn't mean I should blindly believing what he or she says. I have a couple of spiritual masters in my life and I have my disagreements with them, on various matters, yet, the respect and gratitude remains, coz at some point in my life, they were the guiding light. They are not God, they are humans. Treat them as such. I took their guidance, however suitable to me. They didn't coerce me into their ways either. I'm not a zombie and so aren't they. I refuse to be a part of any cult, and choose to think for myself. I suggest that instead of fretting over ppl who follow anyone blindly, let's concentrate on making our lives better :)",

        "There seems to a lot of debate around this, so I want to share my experience:  \nI discovered Sadhguru on YouTube around 6-7 years ago when I was struggling with heavy joint inflammation due to years of suffering from a panic attack disorder. I was also addicted to hashish and suffered from depression and PTSD. I googled \"how to deal with anxiety\" and found a video of his. This led me to his 5-minute morning meditation, which after doing I immediately went \"wow....\" because of the instant relief. Never before had I experienced something so effective. Then I found his 15-minute Isha Kriya meditation, which was even more effective. My, what an immense relief. For the first time I possessed a technique that directly connected me to that which is beyond body and mind and my life was forever changed. This was the catalyst that led to my awakening a few years later, which was the most wonderful blast of pure love and ecstacy. I spoke to God, he told me the soul is eternal and that love is the fundamental energy of the universe, all hardships merely exist on top of the infinite foundation of love and bliss that existence, God, is.\n\nNow if you disbelieve what I just said, of course you're going to disbelieve Sadhguru and all other spiritual persons, and see spiritual practices as occult, manipulative, harmful and evil. That's obvious. Either you know or you dont, either you are spiritually tuned or not. Anyone who is not spiritually tuned will obviously see these things as completely insane, that is highly logical.\n\nHowever, this is my honest experience. I am not paid by Isha, I live in Norway and have never been in contact with anyone from the Isha foundation other than Sadhguru himself through videos.  \nNow, this is the important bit:  \nContinuing to do Isha Kriya regularly, the weight of depression and PTSD slowly faded. My panic attacks became fewer and farther inbetween. I still remembering saying to myself \"I am not this body, I am not even this mind\" and feeling immense relief on a daily basis. I am eternally grateful for this effective yogic key.  \nNow I'm doing Shambavi Mahamudra and am enjoying immense benefits of that aswell. On top of the practices, his philosophies and teachings have brought me immense peace, joy and happinness in a world that only ever told me \"life is a bitch and then you die\". Before him, everyone ever said \"this life is it, you eat, shit, fuck and die\". Like we are animals... How sad. I'm sure the Sadhguru haters deep down believe this depressing fact and are immensely jealous of those who have escaped this illusion and found even a glimpse of the truth of God.\n\nToday, I have become free from my 15-year long hashish addiction. I have no desire to get high, have meaningless sex, eat junk food, binge-watch tv, play video games, nothing like that. It's completely faded into a blissful, open, radiant silence where I am present with my own being every second of every day. I am enjoying a wonderful, peaceful life where I need nothing or noone to be happy. This is largely thanks to my guru and others like him who teach the wisdoms of eternity.\n\nThank you for reading <3 much love to all, even the haters. One day you will understand. Until then, we will simply wait. When the day comes, you will be embraced with the open arms of total forgiveness and unconditional love. Namaste.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Sadhguru is another criminal and a fake guru like Osho, and yet why are so many people following him?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I recently watched this 36 minute exhaustive and well researched documentary by this YouTube channel called Kamdev where he gives clear evidence and proofs of various bullshit spewed by Sadhguru. His father in law accuses him of murdering his wife too. Just because he is in good books of all politicians and celebrities doesn‚Äôt make him all knowing or good. After also watching the documentary on Osho, I realise how similar he is to him, and despite the world knowing about Osho already, there are still so many people who follow Sadhguru in the similar way. Why do you think we are like this? For those interested this is the documentary:",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Because people are stupid, gullible and there's always going to be someone who's going to feed on it. It just so happens that this one speaks English and talks flowery bullshit. I fucking hate Jaggi. I hate every fucker who prays someone else's religious or spiritual sentiments. Aastha is supposed to be pure. These fuckers and other bull fuckers like RSS/BJP etc. prey on these people. I fucking hate it. True. I think more people should question themselves when they blindly follow these godmen because of their friends or peer pressure. It‚Äôs a clear red flag when someone who is a human claims to be a form of god themselves. Those who have actually read Bhagavad Gita should realise that all humans are filled with flaws and imperfections whereas god is perfect and absolute, how can a mere human be compared to god. I don't know anything about sadguru but I am surprised how you declared Osho as fake just by a documentary. Tomorrow I can also make documentary about anyone. Maybe Netflix too may start streaming my documentary made by me but will prove it as an ultimate truth? I declare all of those fake without watching the documentary. I don't even follow Osho but just getting this much influenced by a documentary is not something very good Netflix won't. I find Sadhguru to be an extremely insidious individual. The limited amount of content of his that I‚Äôve seen kind of convinced me that he‚Äôs full of shit. This is content from his own channels. He manages to package regressive thinking and ideas into a progressive and a seemingly intellectual package. I‚Äôm gonna take a look at the documentary in any case. It‚Äôs high time Sadhguru‚Äôs charade is exposed. People hear what they need to hear. Its based on the evidences and facts presented in them right. If something is the truth then facts find their way to the surface eventually. He was the head of the cult and if something does happen it‚Äôs unlikely that it would happen without his knowledge. I‚Äôve also read various accounts of crimes committed in his ashram and the main bio terror attack in US.. you could give the documentary (wild wild country) a watch and form your opinion based on it Definitely watch this documentary by Kamdev where he has done good research and tells us about how Sadhguru got his so called ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù and other shady practices by him like probably killing his own wife Looking at people like Osho, Sadhguru, Nityananda, even I feel motivated to quit my career and become a godmen.. Compared to SadGuru, Osho was a saint! Hahah I think you should watch Wild Wild country on Netflix and then let me know if you still have the same opinion.. While I haven‚Äôt seen this documentary, the limited amount of content I‚Äôve seen on his own channels really showed how he isn‚Äôt what he claims to be (intellectual, progressive, benevolent). You can clearly see patterns of evasive behavior when asked a posed difficult questions, he wraps the regressive ideas under the guise of progressive thinking. He‚Äôs selective about questions he answers and does it with great skill to make it seem like the people who are asking these tough questions are out to get him (basically plays victim). For all the anti-west sentiment we see, 'spiritual' and religious Indians who fall for his schtick do so largely because he can speak English fairly well which sets him above from other such charlatans. Is there a single legitimate Guru lol? They're all fake. But why do you say Osho was fake? Guy was weird for sure but he did not make any supernatural claims. He has three good videos on YouTube. One is where he says there's no God. Another where he says marriage system should be abolished. And third where he says that people should be given safe space to try drugs but we should change society so that people don't need drugs Other videos aren't so good. In one he even talks about telepathy. But there's no comparison. Jaggi is a complete idiot while Osho was quite well read and used to be a professor of philosophy before turning into a god-man (despite him not believing in God, he called himself Bhagwan (apparently the original meaning has something to do with light)) Maybe English teachers in our country should just grow a long white beard and start preaching, it may just do wonders to them.. Since you asked that he is just another \"fake guru\", am curious - what do consider as a \"real\" guru? Brush, Wild Wild Country dekhkr aye ho tum lagta hai. But apart from those things, his teachings are just on a whole another level. Sirf ek documentary k basis pr Osho k against itna strong opinion rakhna is wrong. Nah he's right, it's a comparison. Both are charlatans but at least Osho didnt murder his wife. And I imagine Sadhguru has Osho-like scandals that havent come out yet (I *have* seen that docu). I was very neutral about him until I actually read his book, what a bunch of baloney. I feel bad for all people who fall for thousands of such fake baba/gurus pretending to give them false hope. Nasha hai bro (it‚Äôs a drug). Like all addicts need new stronger drugs‚Ä¶humans need a new flavour high as well. He knows what sells and gives that. He is nothing but a mere intelligent fraud. And people(mostly Indians) around the world are gullible so... Well, him over that bageshwar guy any day. There have been first hand reports from people in rajneeshpuram that there was clear sexual assaults, rape of women and children and yet why do people think Osho is a saint..? Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex. They ain‚Äôt got it. You do. Murari bapu Osho even openly spoke the facts like calling people gullible and retards. All it takes to persuade us is just a little bit of charisma. It doesn't matter if you're a convicted criminal or if you're speaking garbage all day. We get overtly emotional about some BS backstory or some \"sigma\" dialogue that sounds catchy. That's all it takes. Despite having a really high population of engineers and parents who force their children to pick science and ace in them, we're still backward as fuck when it actually comes to accepting science in real life What makes him any \"truer\" than the \"fake\" ones? Damn man, such fancy terminology.. definitely you can be a successful godman too üíÄ He's not biased, not into politics and seems like a good human being. For a guy who calls himself a \"mystic\" lost all credibility when lost his cool on students of NALSAR and was like openly becoming passive aggressive. The group is famous for various sexual assaults, rape on women and children, and also god knows what other shady practices used to happen behind those closed doors, I believe there was one video which was secretly recorded in these so called therapy sessions where the participants literally were fighting and screaming at each other violently and all naked lol.. also they were responsible for one of the largest bio terror attacks in US He might be a great human. No doubt about that. Am not questioning his humanity, am questioning what makes a guru \"real or fake\". He too like Sadhguru or Asharam preaches his religious philosophy and projects himself as \"enlightened\" no? He has just copied almost all of his content from Osho.. the documentary which I linked on this post gives clear evidence of it at multiple instances.. Which part of the clearly exaggerated, common expression, \"compared to x y was a saint\" are you having trouble with exactly? People fall for these scumbags in weak and vulnerable states unfortunately. If everyone had an adequate upbringing none of these charlatans would gain any traction. You do realize he was a cultist right? There are footages of group orgies and stuff from his ashram or center or what ever they call it. Osho had lot of non Indian followers and still he does have many followers despite his death.. so not just limited to Indians.. I just find it so hard to believe people actually fall for these cult leaders and sacrifice and leave out everything.. Does he ? I haven't seen or heard him say those things . But I get what ur trying to mean , questioning everything is the key . I understand the intention of OP, and what you‚Äôre trying to convey. However attributing the term ‚Äúsaint‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs in relative or comparative terms seems like you‚Äôre whitewashing all his crimes.. Can you please provide a source for the sexual assaults and rapes? This is the first I'm hearing of it. Why do you call him fake tho? Did claim to be something he was not? He was quite open about sexuality so the naked screaming fits the bill. But I've never heard of fighting, could be wrestling or sparring but not like the fight club. Maa Anand Sheela was responsible for the illegal activities on US soil, Wikipedia says she went behind his back. He didn't claim to be a saint of Hinduism or anything. He was against all religions and was expelled from college for his views on religion. Yeah, I have also had a bitter taste since learning about him using G63 and some expensive Ducati (I think a multistrada) for save the rivers/soil project. Don't get me wrong I am a car guy myself but I won't be stupid enough to use a vehicle that has a economy in the single digits (even the bike I'm assuming has extremely low economy) and thus far more polluting than other types of vehicles to spread the message of avoiding a different type of pollution. I seriously feel it's just about him being comfortable and enjoying a drive with his project being just some sort of marketing ploy. So many comments bashing Sadhguru here but not a single one mentioning what bullshit does he exactly say and do. What is someone like me with no prior opinion on this topic supposed to think? I am not simply going to go with the herd mentality and believe whatever the internet is saying. I will watch the linked video tomorrow, but it would have been great if one person made a five pointer listing what nonsense this guy actually says. That would at least help me form an opinion of my own. That is a fair request isn't it? Own self Jane Stork, or Ma Shanti B, who was one of the top members of Rajneeshpuram writes in her book about it. A glimpse of the video is shown in the Netflix documentary wild wild country. Sheela was appointed by him only right? It‚Äôs convenient for him to shift the blame on her if anything actually goes wrong, which he did‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why he never spoke much and let Sheela be his front. Because he can speak decent English with an accent They‚Äôre sociopaths, you‚Äôre not. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll stick with your boring ass job and not start a cult. Watch the documentary which I‚Äôve linked in the post, it should give good evidence and context for you. I also agree with your point and don‚Äôt form your opinion on herd mentality, it‚Äôs just an irony or else.. But yeah I think the documentary does a good job exposing him. But did he ever claim to be a saint who wouldn't do any of these things? Why do you call him fake > So many comments bashing Sadhguru here but not a single one mentioning what bullshit does he exactly say and do. He said eating lead will help you be healthy. He claims British named us \"India\". He talks about Many pseudo scientific things which makes zero sense. He considers to be biggest Mafia handling the black money of Politician. His Ashrama in coimbatore is constructed on non-permitted forest. He says sleeping on north Side will cause damage to your brain as 'magnetic field' of earth is on that side. Any link for that video? >would have been great if one person made a five pointer listing what nonsense this guy actually says Ok babu sure pakka karunga Within first 10 seconds of the above linked documentary when a journalist asks him why he didn‚Äôt take permission from forest officials before building his ashram, he loses his cool lol You yourself have written multiple paragraphs on this post till now but still have not mentioned anything you learnt from the video. As I said, it is late right now and I will watch the video tomorrow. It would not have hurt you to elaborate on the point you are trying to make. Hahah yeah you‚Äôre right. Maybe I will try to read more on him.. A new sucker is born every day. Each and every guru/preacher/maulvi/baba/etc of any religion is spewing bullshit half the time They are good at bullshiting and manipulating crowd thus making name for them and eventually links in power circuit and getting involved in all power games Do not believe or follow any one But who doesn‚Äôt like attention, fame and money!? Maybe I can start a cult where everyone actually lives peacefully and happy and even I get to be rich xD I think if there is a god, These people are damaging the faith in god/ higher entity by abusing their trust. However we can say the same thing for all major religions in the world. People are just completely missing the point Because people are stupid and scientific temper is rare in India. Also its much much harder to convince someone they ve been cheated and taken for granted than than cheat them. Because that would mean they are not smart and made a mistake and have been making it for a long time. And everyone wants to think they're smart Cults are not just limited to India though. There were lot of cults in US too.. one of them being the peoples temple cult which ultimately ended up with mass suicide of 909 people.. Go for it! Just need to not have any fear of being mocked. Focus solely on the rewards üí∞ I mean as true your statement is, isn't it really a wrong way of looking at things? I mean I hate these guys (but my perspective has changed a lot on careful thinking). The thing is evolution has pushed our brains to a marvelous capability: That is imagination (into the future), as far as we know no other animal possess such an ability of such a remarkable depth. Now this translates into humans coming together to \"collectively\" build up the entire civilization. But as good a trait it has been, like everything trait in the world, this too comes up with its negative side. In this case it translates into one thing: Faith, now no matter what you say, faith has been and is a very powerful form of imagination that has been foundation of our society, and somehow these people are able to manipulate the faith if people. And yes as you said they should be prosecuted for any kind of criminal activity they, one can not be prosecuted for saying something objectively wrong that gives faith to people, who are we to question if these talks make people happy? The entire basis of organized religions are mythical story yet we accept and respect them as faith, so same is with these people, if something/someone gives satisfaction, and joy to people what's wrong? Right and he sports a long white beard Social media algos are making fake and unscientific stuff more viral. Brother asked a very good question Of course, I would finally end up losing my virginity (sucks to be a 24 year old virgin üò≠) too lmao, and then just have sex all day üòã Bruh the word Saint has nothing to do with it, it's simply a figure of speech. Just be confident and it will be worth it. I lost mine pretty late too , and pretended to be a pro. The girl bought it. Jaggi the wife killer has blatantly ripped off lots of Osho's philosophy. Osho, even though highly controversial was still unique & presented an alternative perspective to lot of things. Jaggi is nothing like that. He's a fake through and through. Yeah I've seen that YouTube documentary ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æ±‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç! But even in countries like USA, we have seen lot of cults, and some even being deadly like the people temples cult which lead to mass suicide of 909 people.. probably it‚Äôs not limited to Indians.. >The voices you hear inside Godmen have always been charlatans feeding on blind faith and gullible people‚Ä¶they are only easier to expose in the modern world that say 1000 years ago How do I explain this to you? If you are to believe he didn‚Äôt let himself to be seen as Saint; treated as Saint, you could still claim he didn‚Äôt claim himself to be Saint. More importantly if you are not willing to consider the volume of evidence and apply critical thinking, what use is any rational explanation to you? The real truth comes out when I read his book I had never read nonsense like that, so much tantrik bullcrap in the book. People like to follow someone! I mean people are getting influenced by gurus just like you got influenced by these documentaries. About the encroachment with respect to the elephant corridor - Vishwaguru True, I did watch 2-3 documentaries about various cults on Netflix and now I‚Äôm completely anti cult, and hate these cult leaders as well.. Only Guru I listen to. Osho was highly logical and knowledgeable compared to Sadhguru. He was one of the best philosophers in India. Unlike Sadhguru, Osho actually exposed religion and considered it as a scam. He was never into politics like Sadhguru. His Ashram and activities there are topics of controversy though. Keeping his con activities aside, he was a great philosopher. Sadhguru just seems fake and self flattering. People are vulnerable about everything. When the country fails to provide what people want they all turn to gurus like this. Thinking these people can sail them fulfill their dreams. People always have wants, some are genuine and can‚Äôt complain like good health of loved ones. Unless people understand that life is going to have sad stuff as well they will never have courage to accept sad things easily and remain coward forever. I don't consider Osho as guru but he was very well read. And, he was able to conclude and propagate those learnings in very practical way. I used to say same things even without watching any documentary that everyone of these are/were fake including Osho. But when I listened a short discourse 'there is no tomorrow' and other few Hindi discourse from his earlier years, it was insightful and life changing for me. Regarding Sadguru and others, I don't know anything. I am not very much interested in religion and religious teachings, so never bothered about them. Sadhguru is given more reverence because he speaks in English. That is his only USP. all are fake It's just not Sadhguru. Any kind of guru or a baba is a fake. Religion is a drug and these Babas and Maulanas are drug sellers minting money out of it. What does he teach? Getting high on a whole another level? Better watch some of his work yourself. And then watch some videos on him. You will get better grasp of situation then someone randomly giving 5 pointers Kabhi aao Bhavnagar, Morari Bapu ki properties dikhata hun. Is Sapiens book your inspiration behind this reply ? I think Osho spoke with a lot of logic. He was a wise, well read man whose work has a great positive impact on many people's lives I know personally. And no, we aren't bhakt type people. Sadhguru seems like an idiot though. I mean, of course he's sharp as a whistle too, with great articulation, but that's that. His teachings wouldn't improve my quality of life or give me answers to some really troubling questions. In Osho's discourses, there's everything. It's because he read so much. There's an entire 10-12 hour discourse on Ashtavakra Mahageeta (a great Indian text) on YouTube. Listen to it, you'll find such immense depth and clarity there. Sadhguru genuinely spews bullshit and gives vague answers. It's like trickery going on. Haha, nope, I just have an interest in observing human behaviour in context of evolutionary progression. Scientist, engineers, doctors, top notch in the world practices what he taught, leading better and healthy life. There are lots of social programs ran by isha. All you're worth is to post something in reddit and feel great by likes and comments from hijacked group of redditters in this thread. Feel great. May his grace help you. Osho is pretty good man . Why should someone form an opinion on a documentary? ‚ÄúReal guru‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist in this world Because we are stupid and vast majority of us lack any form of critical thinking/skepticism. None of what Jaggi claims have any proof whatsoever but people just want someone to confirm their religious biases from someone who looks like he's achieved something. This is what happens when society as a whole strays away from proper scientific education and runs based on religion and superstition. Well now they removed evolution from NCERT textbooks and I'm guessing Jaggi is going to give his own theory to the next generation of idiot Indians. Even in this comment section you'll come across several people defending Jaggi so confidently. Dunning Kruger must be rolling in his grave looking at shit like this. This country is fucked. Who cares? Saying Indians are fools and lack scientific temper and rational thought. Maza hai usme. Because, it indicates we are smarter than the rest of the country taken together. Btw, you're right. Gullibility is a feature of humans and not limited to Indians. And religion latches there. Or nationalism. Politics. Activism of most sorts (vegans, some of the recent women's rights and climate activists... you get the drift). Something deeply emotional and with a possibly \"raw\" feel. Communism is another good example. I know that Isho's ashram had a controversial past but so much of what he says makes so much sense. These guys are just capitalising on people that sense that feeling of hopelessness or people who are lost and directionless. Imo, you can listen to what they say but filter it out and don't make it your personality ffs. They all have an agenda no doubt but something's that they say really add value to your life and these aren't some extraordinary quotes, they're things we all know or have experienced but just said in a well articulated manner. Osho despite all his flaws was far more spiritually and politically aware than Sadhguru. His books and speeches had real substance, unlike the latter. Osho despite all his flaws was still far more spiritually and politically aware than Sadhguru. His books and speeches had a fair chunk of real substance, instead of pseudo-spiritual nonsense the latter blurts out and somehow it still works. Osho started a cult that tried to poison people and owned like 80 Rolls Royces, lol Sadhguru started a movement trying to improve soil quality across the globe and feed malnourished people This thread is so fucking stupid lmao, you have to back to front, Sadhguru is fine people just don‚Äôt like him because no one actually wants to think about spirituality properly lol Please don‚Äôt drag Osho into the mud. Osho had read all the religious books, debated on every religion. Ishi‚Äôs liberal sexual thinking was just not palatable to the Indian society at the time. The people surrounding him indulged in corruption during his lager days when he started losing mental abilities. Osho never pretended to be a scientist or explain scientific phenomenon. Osho urged everyone to meditate and look inwards. He may have had his faults as a human being but wealth was not Oahu‚Äôs goal. This! Yea, wife killer with all sorts of material luxuries def. have some moral ground here, lmao And, improved soil quality with all polyester hoardings of his farce cause around the cities all over? Give it a rest bro, only stupid folks are suckers who keep keep falling for these fucks despite having all the resources at their disposal to know & act better than that. my man zakir bhai mujhe to delusion hai voice sunayi deti hai wo chalega? Easily the GOAT by a mile One and only follow shree krishna Also the episode shows what a shotshow that place was and how it was run by an ego maniac - and not so much about osho He teaches how to commit sex crimes on women and children and get away with it Sadhguru murdered his wife and burnt the body before Police could arrive. During the investigation he ran away to USA. I always say this is because of papa complex. Indians walk on streets searching for their new papa. Apart from that Osho was highly intellectual philosopher. Yeah he might have limitations that's with every guy - Gandhi made mistakes and ambedkar too, Ram made mistakes. I don't think there were many philosophers in history like Osho. Just try to listen him sometimes. I have a list of criticism against him too but then I don't expect everyone to be perfect like 100%. Many of the new \"spiritual teacher's\" since the 20th century are led by ego. And some others that are some sort of activists, Influencers, clinicians, psychologist etc...a specially when their knowledge is mixed with spirituality.. when you get their need to be famous it's all becomes untrustworthy.. Many time I wondered who would they be without all that money and fame. Unfortunately many human are like a herd and Don't have a spine or critical thinking. This. üëçüëç totally agree Alhamdulillah, inshaallah Brother Zakir's greatness deserves praise. Jai Shree Krishna! Because this is India. Gullible idiots will worship anything that moves. Came here to say this, you have written it well bud! üò¨üòÅüòù Yeah. You keep on believing that... Medulla oblongata is sufficient to become a successful politician in India Well articulated comment, thanks. US has a significant percentage of their population who are religious and have issues with science and logic :P Don't forget to grow a white beard before quitting your career. I don't think people would listen to Sadguru for more than 10 seconds if he shaved his beard and dyed his hair black. Please tell me how much so that I can get him out of my parents mind lol I wish he was only famous in India. I'm a westerner and so many influencers here rave about him. I saw two videos from him on youtube and was like what? Some charismatic man giving the most generic advice that lacks any substance. I have no idea who finds that helpful but we (as in westerners that are not practicing Christianity) are so desperate for spiritual guidance that we will take anything we can get if it looks exotic enough. Osho was not a fake guru. Read his teachings. He was the most original speaker ever. I don‚Äôt know how true/logical and original Sadhguru is. Bollywood, cricket, politics and religion will never have any dearth of followers...ever. Wow, many people here have commented the same.. my opinion of him is based on the Wild Wild Country documentary.. anyway if I get time I will try to read up some of his work and form a better opinion.. Damn, it‚Äôs sadder than I expected then. Haha, well I have studied science myself and yet I do believe in god, but not on godmenü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you get time, read the work of Jiddu Krishnamurti as well. He was also one of the best philosophers in India and inspired many philosophers worldwide. I am not sure about sadhguru but osho, osho is cool man ! I disagree for calling osho fake! Lmao yes you‚Äôre right. Unfortunately I think there is some problem with my testosterone levels or something, I have very less facial hair üôÑ so forget this white beard and my plan of becoming a sex guru üò≠ Watch the linked documentary, he has just copied left and right from Osho Its not just indians‚Ä¶every religion has fraudsters including hindusim,islam,christanity‚Ä¶just yesterday, a professor in pakistan had to issue apology for teaching theory of evolution because of pressure from mullahs.(https://thetruthinternational.com/latest-updates/professor-issues-apology-for-instructing-evolution-theory/) ‚Ä¶In christianity you have people like joel osteen and kenneth copeland‚Ä¶ Thanks for the recommendation, will keep it in mind. I should seriously start reading more books, I don‚Äôt read at all üò© He has to take responsibility for the bio terror attack, and various sex crimes committed to women and children in his ashram. Ik.. Zakir naik ko bhi log dekhte h Bro what now? Can you pls share the source of your information! Osho was not fake, although he called himself a conman but he was never fake.. Bro just maxed out on his charisma stat and it doesn't help that most of his followers have level 1 intellect stat This is why I don't like that documentary, it does not tell you anything about the man or his exceptional works, it's a selection of particular events to form an engaging narrative that people would love to consume. It's not a good documentary in that it does not tell you the whole picture. Saste nashe or is bro expensive? * [Narendra Modi is a criminal](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13170914) yet why are so many people vote for him? * [Salman Khan killed a man](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-32603596) yet why are [so many people crazy about him](https://youtu.be/69dUnwuecew?si=4LCG15VtSd88_DFM&t=118)? Critical thinking is not our forte. Atleast Osho talked some sense This guy blabbers whatever comes to his mind. Netflix has a documentary on him called Wild, Wild Country\". Also there's this article, and I'm sure it's in his wiki.

He‚Äôs just another dude with a fancy accent , all his sober blabber are dog shit. He was a total toast on the Joe Roegan podcast Coimbatore hills are taken by isha and karunya ( Paul Dinakaran and co).just the environmental damage is huge. Don't forget to grow a white beard before quitting your career. Imagine Sadguru with black hair and without a beard. Ok i will check the documentary and for the article > On the advice of his lawyer, he pleaded guilty to two of the charges regarding immigration fraud that were pressed against him. Only this i could find in the whole article for which he was pleaded guilty! ‡™ú‡™Ø ‡™∂‡´ç‡™∞‡´Ä ‡™ï‡´É‡™∑‡´ç‡™£ Anyone who teaches you something, is a guru. The ones who advertise themselves as some god's special angels, or god themselves, are the real culprits. If this person had only provided knowledge, things would have been fine. But his followers have made him godlike, to the level that questioning him is dangerous to people's health. This makes someone a false guru. Personally, I think that god is either everywhere or nowhere. If you only find God in selected places, then you aren't looking for God. You want miracles. You want magic, to fix your life magically, and fast. This, my friend, is the biggest fraud. Coz only hardwork (or smart work) pays. Of course, there are backdoors and wrong doors to gain faster money or fame. But don't call it a miracle. It's either a coincidence or shortcut. Don't lose heart. Nityananda has a black beard, and Vishwaguru didn't even have a beard when he started his career. Man, the more properties you show of him, to your parents, the more they'll be impressed. They'll believe that so many people believe him that they donated their properties. This might motivate them to donate some. This is a warning. I have watched many osho videos, read his books. Osho's philosophy was not to follow him, the biggest mistake he made was creating rahneeshpuram. He trusted the wrong people and his ideas were too impractical to implement in a capitalistic world especially America. These people sell hope, that‚Äôs far more addictive than anything else. It‚Äôs the same with evangelists, self-help gurus, etc. It's the accent bro! Lot of people in India, people in general stupid => Lot of stupid and gullible people in India. Buddy if your worldview and opinions are being shaped by Netflix, I have some bad news for you That one maths teacher in your school who'll teach you even if there's apocalypse going on during his lecture. You cant compare this guy with Osho, Osho was very open about being materialistic and wanting power. He practiced what he preached and was open about what it was. I hope this was sarcasm Would you by any chance know of any good books on this topic? Ain't it pretty obvious already, lol > Jiddu Krishnamurti Jiddu was based as fuck. He was groomed to become a religious head. During the ceremony, Jiddu shocked everyone by saying all religions are bs. You cannot run a business of such magnitude unless you are a narcissist. Believe me, Osho, Sadguru, Sai Baba, Sr Sri are all narcissists. They deeply believe in their own greatness. I'm on the fence about Nithyananda. I think he knows he's a fraud. Why do you believe some random YouTube guy ? Why do you follow him ? Some people are just like you . They believe in some things and follow. I The comments on that video lol. I recently learned that he pays one of the highest amounts for ads (in the world) on facebook. That's why you always end up seeing some of his meticulously crafted reels. It doesn't even matter if you are into him, he reaches the masses, intentionally or unintentionally. Moron of a person but fantastic businessman. He was a deeply narcissistic sociopath who built his empire with the help of a murderous lunatic. He was a high functioning sociopath who knew how to manipulate people and be charismatic, same as this sadhguru guy. He was neither knowledgeable nor logical. Repackaging the \"free love\" movement of the 1960s mixed with indian mysticism does not make one a philosopher. There was nothing revolutionary about him. For the sake of preserving whatever sanity that is left in our society, please maintain a high level of skepticism before admiring conmen who inflicted generational damage. He's speaking the language of Gods Vivekananda, rabindranath tagore, Aurobindo to name some though they probably are philosophers more than gurus. If you are looking for religious gurus, I would consider chinna jeeyar as far better and moral than any of these sadhguru, sri sri type con artists Osho is very good way to learn about Buddhism, taoism and all interesting eastern and western philosophy/ psychology. Of course he has done horrible stuff but you can't deny his experience and knowledge. Ignore that person. Medulla oblongata is sufficient to become a successful politician or godman in India. In fact, the latest research indicates that having a ventromedial prefrontal cortex is detrimental to achieving success in the world! Guru guru ho jao shuru‚Ä¶ Why does anyone follow a cult? He's just another dangerous guru with a curated PR team and a bullshit message. People are idiots. He is not intelligent. It's all bullshit and play with the words. Nashe har ek ke liye - koi patte pe khush hai or kisi ko coke chahiye‚Ä¶ ;). Sounds like you need some inner engineering /s Sadhguru is quite capable of holding a large audience captive and make them feel better about life! In India, we have a long long long history of deep academic philosophical thought and these guys are the last remnants of the style Vivekananda started by travelling the world, speaking in English and popularising various schools of Indian philosophy. Of course he is not a scientist or philosopher and makes up a lot of nonsense. I see him as fairly harmless to society. At least he isn‚Äôt spewing hatred or mobilising violence. Just talking to people and charging them a lot of money for it which people willingly pay. Aye. Spoken like sadhguru. This guy is snake oil salesman. Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, Vivekananda to name a few. Do you guys ever listen osho properly?, you guys can't even understant complexity of osho work, comparing him with sadhguru show how ignorant you must be, osho was not some lousy wannabe acharya who massage hindu, muslim, christian ego in name of dharma, Fake yes... Don't know if he is criminal or not... But since childhood I have learned to keep most of these self proclaimed gurus at a distance... Even after coming across so much hype about him i never dared to watch a video of him but since internet somehow throws shut at you i have watched a few shorts if him which confirmed my doubts about him that he's not the one I have to follow... Don't watch bro... Be sane... You can't decide fir others... Decide fir yourself... >one can not be prosecuted for saying something objectively wrong that gives faith to people Doing this for money is literally a crime in multiple states in India under anti superstition laws. As it should be. A charlatan defrauding you to get rich be selling a fake product, whether it be rollex or the notion offood rotting during grahan, is a criminal. Your argument holds true only for people not making money out of irrational beliefs, and there are are none of those generating irrational beliefs at industrial scale. English teachers in flowery white bears preaching participles would be a sight to behold. Prabhu ka prakop at every misplaced apostrophe, verbal violence at every you're replacing your and later replacing latter. A great find to expose one of the biggest cults of this country. Nobody should have to follow a single guy without having full knowledge about them. That's stupidity at its highest level. Personally I found some of his quotes and videos on death comforting after my father passed away unexpectedly during covid. I was devastated and like every other human was looking for some answers. I am of the firm opinion that you should only imbibe or accept the preaching which you find sane to your rational mind and throw away other bullshit. It is upto us to filter it out. Many of his quotes could be copy paste or derived from some other philosophers, but I am not blind follower of the man himself. Sadguru is the biggest impediment in the path to Dravidian enlightenment in TN and South India. Wonder how so-called rational Periyarists allow him to preach on Tamizh soil. I agree. I‚Äôve only read Osho‚Äôs books, and I absolutely loved those. Really helped with keeping myself cantered when I was going through a shitstorm when I was a teenager. Like you, I always viewed his work as closer to philosophy with a dollop of spirituality. Don‚Äôt know much about Osho beyond that, but from what I remember- his views are not even close to the garbage Sadhguru spews. He teaches all religions are scam Ranveer prayagrajia in his next podcast- Is sadhguru dissendent of Alien ancient Hindus I'm a Muslim and find this guy repulsive what oh my god 1. Ain't it pretty obvious, lol Coz its india.... Thoda padh le research kr le bhai osho ke bare me, yahi hota adhura gyaan le kar gyaan pelne se. Ek documentry dekh kr views banane se. Aww! Did I hurt your hymen too ? üòÇ More like FraudGuru. If you think Osho is a fraud without having listened to a single discourse of him, You're seriously delusional. People are gullible and they won't admin they are. Which also makes them non self aware. All these people here saying Osho wasn't 'as bad'. Bruh, it doesn't mean he was good. You like his philosophy? Sure, but you're ignoring all the crap he was involved in. You can't define a man by what they say. Anyone can say flowery stuff and preach about spirituality. It's the actions that define the man. That Ram Rahim guy had so many followers because he spoke well. Are you going to ignore all the bs he did? What about Asaram bapu? Sant rampal guy? It's easy to say whatever pleases the crowd. Anyone can sound myatical. These guys were good orators and manipulators, that's why so many people were swayed by them. Hitler was a good orator. Look at Charles Manson, the people from Scientology, Jim Jones, and so many others. It's easier to fool people than convince them that they are being fooled - Someone said. if you earn a persons respect, they will ignore your flaws. So he marketed himself as a guru first, earned peoples respect and now the truth is coming out and his followers will ignore it. You saw the flaws first, that's why you are agitated. Watch Veerapan's wife's interview in Netflix, and you'll understand what I said. Many more cases, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, Asaram Bapu. Gotta disagree with you. Was a sociopath. Was not highly logical or knowledgeable. Just regurgitated hippee taking a leaf from all religious texts and philosophers. &#x200B; You should file an fir amd go to court if you have actual evidence against him, it will expose him I'm not saying that he was a saint or even a good person I just want to know why OP thinks he was fake can you tell me your antithesis to this fake guru? Democracy means for the people, of the people, by the people. But people are retarded. Really interesting, I had my own doubts as well. Problem with enlightenment is, when they achieve even 10%, they start believing that they themselves are god. I know many such modern gurus who just correlate religion with big bang theory to create sellable literature. If he says that when we goto temple, we hallucinate god, in same way, there is no evidence that he himself is not hallucinating about his own beliefs. Does anyone know about avdhoot baba shivanand? He uses law of attraction concepts and packages it with sadhanas and sells it to gullible people. However he is not involved in any scams or other stuff. His entire family is in this business. Sure in many speeches he tells to put effort and only then result will come. But again as I said I find some of his stuff is fishy. Like in his website it is mentioned he is a cosmic scientist!!! Matlab kuch bhi. Oh my G. Exactly my thoughts. Just because he is speaking English people think he is very intelligent. Team guru is the one who makes your own master. Like Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Read more on This is totally non commercial where your Kundalini is awakened with your own desire. Experience it yourself. There are centres all over the world. And it‚Äôs Free. What makes the above \"true\" as opposed to Sadguru? And Hitchens was an atheist, not a spiritual leader of a communion. There is. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Founder of Sahajayoga.ca Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, Jiddu were true teachers because they cared very little about having a massive following and they just answered people's questions. Nisargadatta Maharaj had a bedi shop and would welcome anyone to debate with him. Christopher Hitchens is an atheist everybody knows that but I would consider him a guru for teaching people how to be articulate and how to debate with facts. Hitchens stood up to many religious bullies he is a true role model for many. I speak English really well, and the number of times I've gotten away with shit due to that in India explains Sadhguru's popularity. The bigotry is masked by the fluency of his words. Folks, it seems a case of seeing what you believe in. If Sadhguru is acquitted and proven no false doing in court, then the opinion becomes he is \"good books\" of all politicians. There are thousands of people who vouch that rheir life has improved post association with the organization. People paying for something improves their life is illegal? It seems, people cant stomach other people's success. I like Swami Nityanand better. Fucker manged to buy his own Island. \"For which, I will provide a stupid answer\" Good old Joker Naik In India, being a spiritual guru is very easy if you know what to say. Read some self help and philosophy books. Mix them with some religious and spiritual shit and bam, you're rich. Osho and Sadguru made it big because they could speak fluent English. So people equate that with intelligence here and you see the results. Billions of people in the world still believe in fake and made up things. In like 500- 1000 years future generations will look down upon us. That is if we don't kill each other for the 'GOD' Add Bageshwar Dham or something to that list... I don't actually remember that name Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh‚Ä¶ The Sadhguru follower will write an elaborate defence for him and clear his name and since there's nothing substantial about him, will go on to malign others. True Osho follower will read the entire thread, find all the back and forth amusing for its shallownes, and will simply move on. Lots of people can give spiritual guidance. The problem is when they give contradictory advice or say things that doesn't even match reality. It doesn't help when they give toxic political sentiments either. To me i think sadhguru was enlightened once. But it's also easy to fall out of enlightenment and that definately happened to him. A number would still be good. Regarding Modi the case was debated and he was given a clean chit by the Supreme Court itself right. In the case of Jaggi, he just fled to US and the case was closed due to lack of evidence. Tomato tomahto Lol Thanks for the motivation!! You should become my first follower ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è then when I become a big guru you can handle my empire while I chill.. Guru means the one who can remove the darkness within. Guru is usually the one who has walked the spiritual path and achieved a state of enlightenment or samadhi. What is samadhi you may ask? It is that state of inner mental rest and quititude which all of us are searching consciously or unconsciously. Now coming to Osho or Sathguru, for all your negative comments, I can assure you both of them achieved that state, which is considered the highest in this culture. But does that make them perfect? Well till the time a human is in the material plane there is always a risk of r erring‚Ä¶ So what‚Äôs the way? I would suggest that instead of hating someone, try and take the best of their teachings and leave what you cannot grasp. The issue is if you hate someone you close all the doors to learn, which is a self defeating process and won‚Äôt actually help achieve anything Osho was an intelligent and highly charismatic cult leader of his times. It is eww to follow such ppl but I randomly see some clips posted by friends from osho's teachings and man makes sense so I get his appeal although f*cker should've rotted in jail. What I don't understand however, is why are people my generation so impressed by sad guru. Bande me aisa kya hai üò≠üò≠üò≠. Does this indicate that my generation is superdumb? Itna low standards to following a cult toh is too much ü•≤ü•≤ ü§° I don‚Äôt think Shirdi Sai Baba is a narcissist and can be clubbed with these other gurus.. Because he has presented solid proof and evidence? And is able to get away with unpaid labour by terming it as ‚Äúvolunteering‚Äù, further is evading tax by showing the transactions as ‚Äúdonations‚Äù Ongzy bongzy bong bing bing boo Spirituality is a scam always believed that always will and nothing will change my mind. Many shameless people cash in on this due to weak emotional intelligence. People require certainty and belonging in life. Majority of Indians do not have certainty in life due to lack of infrastructure and resources. In the West people lack belonging due idea of individual freedom,waning of religion , high level of prosperity making you less dependent on others etc. Cult leaders provide certainty and belonging hence they will continue to be popular in the East and West... Because he speaks in English and his pseudo intellectualism comes off as smart or insightful. If you hear what he's saying he sounds like most of the WhatsApp forwards that are just empty analogies that don't work in the real life at all. That's just what Osho did Just a matter of time when things become ugly.. all cults are dangerous because the power is concentrated to one person and his followers will literally do anything as the leader wants them to.. history is the witness to it, people‚Äôs temple, Shoko Asahara, Osho, and probably many more Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt end up well. Maybe even if the person is actually good, cults always end up the same way and maybe power does corrupt you Exactly this needs to be the top comment. Trust me I‚Äôve literally seen comments of so many people here defending Osho and some even being aggressive about it.. maybe he was well read and had strong philosophical views, but does it make him a good human? Ma Anand Sheela was just a pawn and we all know that it‚Äôs Osho behind the scenes, so it‚Äôs quite convenient for him to shift the blame on her.. I‚Äôm just surprised to find cult followers here.. By ur own logic, anyone who teaches is a guru. U don't have to agree with their views but Sadguru, Sri Sri etc are all \"teachers\" to someone. Yeah you‚Äôre right and the veerapan documentary was quite good, I‚Äôve watched it. 4 red flags for me - long beard - modern English accent - Tons of Ads & $200 courses - self proclaimed divine birth However what do I know‚Ä¶I do give benefit of doubt to popular wisdom. So I keep my mind open about him. Besides, what he‚Äôs doing is harmless and maybe a net benefit to the society. People need a common ground to unite. I think some other YouTube channel did cover about it, maybe it was Mohak Mandal. What he sells may actually be helpful cause meditation and yoga is proven to be effective and the sense of community and togetherness which comes with it does wonders. But he is shady af and people should stop blindly following him Ppl get what they ask for. Jaggi is a 'businessman' However blind following a cult leader will only lead to a disaster in future. The followers will literally do anything as the leader demands them to do. What's so negative about Osho in that documentary that gives you the feeling that he wasn't knowledgeable? There was nothing of that sort in the documentary, in fact it actually showed his creative glimpses. I'm a real guru, I don't expect any followers but I'm always willing to teach. I don't want money from you, I don't want to start a cult and I'm not aligned to any religion. I'm a real guru. No I'm not fake. Yaar left and right people here are defending Osho despite all the shady stuff associated with his cult and his followers.. I‚Äôve never actually read or seen his teachings, so I can‚Äôt comment on it. Sadguru has an accent, speaks fluently, sports a white beard, what else is needed? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But yeah he has managed to advertise himself quite well by associating with all top celebrities (Bollywood and even Hollywood), and politicians.. as you know that we love our celebrities and they themselves are a form of cult leaders, so yeah one cult leader ends up helping the other üòÇ This post is incorrect on many levels and should not be permitted. I agree üíØ. You are intelligent than the other 75% on this plant earth. Remember the 4th Pillar! Agreed. That‚Äôs the reason finding a good guide is critical but also really hard. But all I am saying you cannot water down them altogether. They are really accomplished individuals spiritually and have achieved the state which as per this culture is the ultimate realisation. All the teachings are just pointing to a direction. The power is concentrated in one single individual and any human is not free from flaws. It‚Äôs only a matter of time when he may lose his mind and order his followers to do atrocities and they may actually do it too, because after all leader can‚Äôt be wrong Ok Akhil Where did they even say he was good. So why did you write such a long post assuming something they say? You asked for a \"good\" guru definition. Anybody can be a guru(teacher) but a good one is tough to find. So then how is he same as Sadhguru? Both are different criminals, so they ain't same at all. Sadhguru to Zakir goat naik My gut wrenches when I see people Osho and Sadhguru in the same sentence. At least have the decency to read/listen to a bit of what the guy had to say instead of making your conclusions from a Netflix documentary. Thanks for saying this! Sadhguru has nothing new to add. Hi plagiarism is embarassing. Osho at least had some really interesting things to say. So what's the dirt on you My virginity ‡§≠‡§æ‡§à ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§µ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à That is not my point. You are doing the same thing. I am asking you why and you are saying solid proof what ever that is . Other people believe him and wasting time. They will also tell the same that guy is great . It is a cult and people who know about it won‚Äôt join. His die hard fans start answer about his stupidity like this \"Not a sadhguru fan but bla bla bla ...\" I finished his book \"Karma\" just this month. Most of the ideas were derived from Geeta. However, I think that book helped me at least my reminding some basic principles from Geeta. Everyone is appreciating his patience lol I never get it how come people praise and follow those people who themselves haven't done any real shit or those who worked real hard and then after success stopped and are being lazy asses, all those motivational speakers/podcasts etc haven't done shit ,just mere big mouths like him,Mel Robin, unlike those who have done something big and yet not finished like Elon Musk, David goggins, etc Classic Dune plot. They make you the god I bet 100rs that someone will screenshot this post n post it on youknowheretheidiotsdwell... Also I respect this guy. He is bloody talented to say outright bs and get followers. Wish I was this good imao. Because Will Smith and Trevor Noah met with him This had me laughing out loud.I have been an English teacher for 8 months, and the experience was life changing.I really changed my mind about teachers.The amount of effort you put in is nothing. compared to the meagre salaries. About the spellings, and punctuation, it is too frustrating. Sadhguru is a good con artist with his words, sad to see so many people blindly follow him. That Isha foundation is multi million project of his Would never defend Osho but I've always appreciated classier and finer more intelligent villains than down right dumb villains, you see my point?? üò≠üò≠ my mind is broken. > anyway if I get time I will try to read up some of his work and form a better opinion.. And this was your undoing. Why don't you actually read and then form an opinion? Bro I need to talk to you about something may I DM you? Well I notice a lot more Osho fans here and very few Jaggi fans Very articulate, confident and good knowledge is what I get off of him. He might not be a moksha attainted person but that‚Äôs fine. He is doing a great job of propagating Hinduism internationally as well as domestically. Ask yourself, what have you done for your religion before pointing finger at others. Yo Interesting Glad someone finally said something. I‚Äôve watched his videos a few times and he never said anything of substance it was all just common knowledge and nonsense. And he killed his wife which is enough of a reason to never listen to him, Osho was a brilliant philosopher. You must read his books before saying it is hard to believe. You can't elevate yourself by passing judgements on those who are far more intelligent and educated than you. If you are saying that they are fraud then you must have intellect superior than them to come to that conclusion. Lmao.. you do have high standards, gurl‚Ä¶ however this is reality, and not some anime/bollywood story ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so tune your expectations done xD Every religious Guru is fake there is nothing special about him. Definitely you‚Äôre correct, but realistically speaking, reading all his books, listening to all his talks and speeches and interacting with his cult members is just too time consuming and not actually possible cause of limited time. It‚Äôs easier to form opinions based on well researched unbiased documentaries which give sufficient evidence and proofs to substantiate their claims. Newslaundry did a detailed reporting on this fraud Jaggi, You can read their other reports on their site. Isn't the whole concept of organized religions the same? Ramallah stands for violence for subjective righteousness. Krishna stands for scamming people, funny when someone else is tricked, not funny when you're the target. That‚Äôs right, cult leaders are always gonna be bad, and it‚Äôs just a disaster waiting to happen. We should stop with this blind following of other humans who are just as flawed as we are. Yo Teach what. Teach some positive which is universally accepted, or teach something morally subjective or non-confirmable \"facts\". How do you know what you teach is objectively useful to someone. Why not just get govt accredition to teach in schools if making a cult is not your goal Osho was a real guru don't hate the guy on the basis of a documentary learn about his teachings then decide. Sadhguru is the baba ramdev of middle-rich people power over people Criticizing others makes you feel superior, doesn't it. Hating everyone has become a trend nowadays. Some of his videos about sourcing happiness from within and not giving control over your happiness to others does makes sense. While many of his supernatural stuff doesn't make sense. But India is a country where people believe in god, when that shit doesn't exist. So he doesn't want to break people's bubble and lead everyone to chaos. Instead he uses it to make people live a content life amidst this fucked up life and to make some money ofcourse. Just take what you want and stop poking into others business unless you are sure what he does is seriously damaging the society. Wild Wild West was a documentary with criminal take on mroe complex person (thriller types), Osho‚Äôs spirituality philosophies and thoughts are never talked about. A very American take on the subject. He's a Grade A opportunist! Used to suck up to DMK and Karunanidhi when he was limited to Tamil Nadu and they were in power. But when he was in danger of getting exposed for all the land he stole from the tribals, he went into Modi's lap to protect himself. Wild Wild West was a documentary with criminal take on mroe complex person (thriller types), Osho‚Äôs spirituality philosophies and thoughts are never talked about. A very American take on the subject. He says what his Target audience wants to hear. My friend sent me some random lecture of his and I told him how such lectures are created by reverse engineering and he never sent me any of his videos since In India, success is not appreciated, people are jealous and burn themselves in this process. Critics have no work or think good about themselves, this is proven. OP may be mentally smart, but not financially to become billionaire. Many average Indians are not mentally smart, they often look for answers and if anyone is providing them guidance, people are happy with it, what is the problem with OP? Out of 10, If 8 people are happy and 2 people aren't, should we believe 8 or 2? The truth is that you don't know. Knowing about something and knowing something are two different things. You have no way of knowing for sure whether he is enlightened or not and if karma is real then spewing venom against someone enlightened on a public platform can't be good. So the wise thing to do is to do meditation/spiritual practices and try to know for yourself or just accept that you can't know and move on. If he is a fake guru and karma is real then he will deal with the consequences himself. Do you know the definition of a guru? Even one who teaches universally accepted facts to those who don't know it yet is also a guru. So what are you contesting here? If your comparing any 2 bits guru with Osho than u have no idea what Osho was all about. You need to educate yourself first about his teaching before you speak like an andhbhakt. Yes. ü§° lol What makes you credible and different then Kamdev is the channel and he makes netflix level type of documentaries , the amount of research he put is commendable If 8 people are assaulting/raping 2 people, the 8 people are happy but 2 people won‚Äôt be. Does your logic hold here too? But mere therapist toh kehta hai ki usse y schizophrenia kehte hai Why would I be worried about it and why should I prove it to you or anybody? That's exactly why I'm real, I clearly said I don't even want any followers/students. I think you are missing the point completely. So I have no reason to prove that, else I would come across as someone desperate and that isn't who a real guru is. Exactly, his video on the caste system clearly depicts this point. Everyone should watch that to know how his sinister ideology works. Sadhguru is just a front face of an org that offers protection to elite and power class as they retreat from their work life. The community is powerful and can even turn govt machinery in any direction it want to as and when needed True People.calling OSHO a fraud, don't know the difference between their elbow and ass. They know jackshit about philosophy that is agnostic to religion. People who call Sadguru fall broadly in the same category. These people are flat-earthers. They have to learn / understand what they are teaching. Pls remember OSHO downfall was because of his power Hungary student. If the movement has survived for decades after his death there must be something. People are conditioned to think in a way (brainwashed by the west)! If someone wants to debate on the philosophies of OSHO and Sadguru, pls talk to their devotees and followers. If these individuals had not had a particular effect on people the movement would not have flourished. OSHO books are outstanding. Sadguru's books are good. If someone is finding flaws , they have to talk what their accomplishments are. Happy to discuss as long as it is respectful. Cigarette companies also know what they are selling and idiots still buy them. Disclaimer : I smoke. Newslaundery has enough shit against them. If you dig you will get it. Do you have proof? Hold my beer till then Ya, hiding well in Malaysia. Putting doctors videos. Why do you care? Whatever floats a person‚Äôs boat! Certainly, Gurudev! I saw another one of Sadhguru's grifts where rich and semi-rich people pay Sadhguru's company a crazy amount of money for a supposed hike into some mountains and then the people make like videos claiming how they pushed themselves to their mental and physical limits to get closer to god and such and then they meet with Sadhguru at the end. The thing is most of these participants and the people filming are so dumb they video too much and they show that they're being brought around by a bus filled with old, out of shape people wearing just North Face fashion gear and pretending to do mountains. It's just a sightseeing tour in some mountains where they take breaks along the way to see some sights and then they hike somewhere at the end for short time from the main road and then meet Sadhguru and it's done. Per person the fee is something like 12,000 USD and they have like 40 retirees in these groups who also go on to grift using it claiming they pushed themselves when it was a pensioner sightseeing tour in a bus. Awesome, we can be the next Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and Ma Anand Sheela üî•ü•π Because he regularly \"owns\" and \"shuts up\" anyone insulting the right wing agenda, i mean our religion Dude don't drag Osho in this. Having osho and sadhguru in the same sentence is an abomination. Coz india is a fucking country of illiterates. People will blindly follow things which are pleasing their ears in the name of religion. That's why these babas have come into spotlights This guy is an absolute piece of shit. As Indians we are raised to be dependent on someone to do the thinking for us, make decisions for us. This complete lack of individuality results in always trying to find a \"parent figure\" whom you can rely on. I am living in Canada and at my university, someone posted these \"Inner Engineering\" posters with Sadhguru's face on it... I doubt the person who made the poster knows who Sadhguru really is. I took down a few posters lol. If I had the resources, time, and skill, I'd put up \"Escape the Matrix\" posters with Andrew Tate's photo just to troll them. Need chocolate ? Ryokan, a Zen master, lived the simplest kind of life in a little hut at the foot of a mountain. One evening a thief visited the hut only to discover there was nothing to steal. Ryokan returned and caught him. ‚ÄúYou have come a long way to visit me,‚Äù he told the prowler, ‚Äúand you should not return empty-handed. Please take my clothes as a gift.‚Äù The thief was bewildered. He took the clothes and slunk away. Ryoken sat naked, watching the moon. ‚ÄúPoor fellow,‚Äù he mused, ‚ÄúI wish I could have given him this beautiful moon.‚Äù He based his entire opinion about Osho based on a single documentary. The inability to form your own conclusions based on critical thinking is a massive problem of the current age. We have a lot of information sources, yet lesser people thinking about the information they take in. Never got his hype. I have seen way too many fake gurus to trust him Also he came on Joe Rogan show that's crazy What do you think about what other religions prophet and saints are? They all were humans and started to show more intelligent beings like they have answers to all questions around life and people git do impressed that made them god or god messenger etc and started to worship their clut, that's \"religion\" for you, that's how it started. He has himself told that critical thinking is not his forte Who collects money from people and says his books are private - whats hapenning with the money - who gets saved by politicians - why - who has ever been rich yet a ‚Äòguru‚Äô The same reason we still have religion. The masses have a thing for articulate, bearded, robe-dawning self-proclaimed gurus that smile all the time. Sign of supposedly enlightened ones. Lmao.. I would spend lot of money on gadgets but never on stuff like this He is deceiving people with all the spirituality bull shits, but he's a good speaker, i listen to his view on some philosophical topics it is interesting so it's not a surprise people follow him let alone all his claims of projecting himself as some sort of a devine yogi But you can definitely trust me sis ü•∫ So what you want to beleive is based on an video right? Its called influenced not research. If you want to research visit Isha visit the 12 rural school they run. Visit the river Krishna which got a new life under his campaigning. Also make exhaustive research on save Soil facts. Its a fact that mama Earth soil is producing less food than before. But hating someone who is a Rags to riches story is so easy. Why don't you give a try to run a rural school where you pay the teachers while students study free. He is running a business and doing a damn good job at it. And like all businesses, his foundation does a lot of shady stuff but then if you are rich and influential, laws don't apply to you. idk man. a friend of mine who makes about a million dollars a year at a hedge fund swears by him. I agree with you It's so sad to witness the decline in human intellect. All thanks to the internet. This dead screen makes us vulnerable to mind manipulation and we willingly get manipulated. Have you tried his free YouTube meditation ‚ÄòIsha Kriya‚Äô? Try and comeback again with your opinions. Osho was actually an intelligent guy Sri Sri Ravishankar, sadguru, Osho, Aurobindo, Brahmakumari, all Ammas are all fake He speaks logically though, take positive things from him ! Are you worried that he is making money?? He is nowhere close to Osho. Lol ! I am going to make an omnibus statement, all of hindtuva and their progenitors are two penny frauds. You can start with baba ramdev to sadhguru . Though, it's also a poetic justice that the biggest fools who subscribe to these baba are the very hindutva folks. So good going. The enemy of my enemy is... Could you please link the caste one, i have seen the kamdev one the man got away with murdering his wife god knows how many else In case of sadguru verdict is already given. He was given clean chit. Wait , can someone please explain how was Osho a fake guru? From what I have seen from him , seems legit and very knowledgeable. Sadhguru is a cheap copy of Osho , but more political and more Hindu oriented. His rise also coincides with rise in hindu nationalism and he milks it for his profit. Before 2010s I haven't even heard of the dude ( being a north Indian), maybe he was famous in South more. But I admire his skills in getting followers and running the business. Being a fake guru also requires charm and instincts , it's a different kind of genius. Despite being so openly foolish and using catch phrases like Quantum etc , and being under scrutiny from some people , also under suspicion of killing his wife , he still is probably the biggest guru in India , in top 10 Self Help gurus in World. And that takes skills , just not the ones his followers come to him for. He should teach public speaking , charm , how to cover up murders etc and I'd be his number 1 folllwer Yeah I was talking about the same doc which I have linked in main post Lmao why do you wanna learn how to cover up murders.. üíÄ and don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre asking for a friend He maybe whatever u say, But his teachings they feel practical and real , That's enough for me ,there is a sense of peace while listening to him. And also I have been following him since 3 years never have I ever paid them a penny,nor will i in future. I don't care I'll still be a fan of the persona that is sad guru besides this YouTuber is not above the court of law of he did something illegal he should be jailed yet he is not so idc Osho, Rajneesh, was an spiritual leader and a prominent figure in the New Age movement. His teachings emphasized meditation, mindfulness, love, and the importance of living in the present moment. However, his controversial viewpoints and the practices of his followers led to various scandals and legal issues in the 1980s. Despite the controversies, Osho's teachings continue to have an impact on spiritual seekers and those interested in alternative philosophies. You have to listen or read him. Don't make an opinion by just watching a documentary Lol ü§£, I won't waste time in answering hypothetical situation. Try your luck then, there would be another thread about unsuccessful tech idiot sitting on bed tying luck in spiritual world. Thanks for this post. Never really liked him anyway. Now there's a lot of proof. Bro‚Ä¶ na imma just leave you to it Thank you for your kind comment. I‚Äôve been getting lot of toxic and abusive comments as well after this post haha. But anyway I wanted to just spread awareness and don‚Äôt want people to blindly follow cult leaders. It‚Äôs the most dangerous thing. There are definitely genuine and knowledgeable gurus though but maybe he‚Äôs not one of them. Also sending more strength on your way to overcome whatever you maybe facing! Hang tight and you will come out victorious! You can't compare Osho to Sadhguru imo. Osho was knowledgeable and what he spoke was legitimate philosophy. He was also the professor of philosophy in a college and revered by many scholars in India. Osho speaks legit philosophy and he was a very learned man. then there is that cult of that fat weird guruji in delhi lmao, i keep my distance from people who worship him me. Big difference between sadguru and osho. Osho openly supported cannabis and sex. He was no way religious or attached himself to a religion whilst sadhguru is, though he is not open but he is a hardline hindutva ideologist. Osho and the 70s hippy culture went alongside each other. Sadhgurus past is shady. taar chipak gaye chaati se... now that i type it, i realise how weird the lyrics are. Apt for the song though. Dude him and his little cult tried to poison an entire town in US.Thats the reason he was kicked out of the country.What do u mean by far more \"intelligent\" and educated.An all knowing guru who couldn't even understand his close aide was trying to poison an entire town,kill an attorney or was actively trying to murder him until it was too late.What a fucking joke üòÇ Some subreddit geniuses named him \"Jatti Pesudev\" . It's crazy how the name ( In Tamil) describes the guy with a certain degree of accuracy. Sadhguru is an enlightened being. You will be stupid to believe all those propaganda videos. It's high time for Superman to be a Guru and Sell hope Oh there are lots of Osho fans here To me both are shady. I did listen to some of the talks by Osho on YouTube and wasn‚Äôt so impressed as others here are making it to be. Rather, I heard Acharya Prashant and was truly impressed with his knowledge about our scriptures and the way he is able to convey ideas which actually make sense. I just saw the whole video you posted. It was pretty well made, here are some of my thoughts: 1. I didn‚Äôt have any idea of his backstory but I‚Äôm not surprised by it, it‚Äôs in the vein of all other enlightenment/guru reincarnation stories. 2. The business models being similar to Osho is no surprise either, almost all the godmen have similar business models. 3. What was missing was a more comprehensive takedown and analysis of his talks and societal opinions. As young people flock towards him, it‚Äôs important to highlight these things and leave people to come to their own conclusions. 4. The whole mystic cop out where they say things like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt understand the meaning unless you reach enlightenment yourself‚Äù is also a very common pattern. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs even been tacked onto Sanathan Dharma. It‚Äôs the cop out that makes it a mystical / god given knowledge that select few can understand. I havent watched him extensively par maine 2/3 videoes dekhe hein. These teens/adults ask questions and if they question him about something he finds offensive, he goes very defensive and lowkey bullies them. And i started disliking him. I think he sucks. How many people know he sold cannabis in the streets of Coimbatore Tamilnadu. He's a registered criminal back then lmao Great to see people like you in our country üòÄ It's very saddening that people here will call out Sadhguru, but in the same sentence will call osho a great spiritual being, when even his closest disciples have called him a fraud. And not to say the countless reports of sexual assault and abuse in his ashrams, I have read osho's work bc my grandfather is a disciple osho and apparently he have attained enlightenment too by osho's standard and u might think a person who have achieved enlightenment must be the calmest person on earth but no, my grandfather is an abusive alcholic asshole who made his wife's life a living hell and so does his children, I hope u realise anyone who preaches enlightenment are either scammers or narcissist who think they are above everyone. Thanks for sharing your experience. I agree with you and also I‚Äôm sorry regarding your grandfather and the problems he has caused. But yeah you can‚Äôt trust any other so called guru because they are humans at the end of the day right and humans are flawed. Only people I have respect for are those who are knowledgeable, have worked hard and actually studied and read a lot. Make those people your idols :) Dude, seems like they have removed the video due to court order. Looks like Kamdev bro might be fighting a court case. I just opened the video it‚Äôs working for me? Is it because I‚Äôm in UAE? Yes. In am in India and this is what I can see. OP clearly hasn't done his homework imo, since he's comparing OSHO with sadguru. He says what people.want.to.hear ..this is your answer that's why he is popular. Second. Osho wasn't fake, I am.curious what's your definition for fake? This video exposes all that you need to know about FAKE sadhguru. Check out other videos on the same channel. Worth watching. another good video and channel exposing all his wrong doings by multiple people dangerous man skip to 35 minutes: Thank you for pointing this out. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss Osho, but he was transparent, and he shared a lot of wisdom. Others can disagree , but he can‚Äôt be just blanketed. Very wise . ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è People have since ancient times had a want and need for a concept of 'the sage' in lack of many sages in the world these days (wise spiritual men with beards), people will follow cult leaders. After all, we can't really call most of our actual nation's leaders wise men, or sages. they couldn't pin the poison thing on Osho despite finding 2000+ hours of recorded audio from tapes that sheela got by bugging his room. they had to resort to making a flimsy immigration fraud case for a reason. coz the other shit didn't stick to him. he literally wrote commentary discourses on every major and minor scripture in the world. compared to that sadhguru openly admits to not being well read un hindu scriptures let alone anything else. so yea osho was better read It's a really really low bar when you compare one with sadhguru lol. Being well read than Saddhu is not a flex you think it is. I think you misread my comment to think I am some kind of fan of Saddhu. you're the one who misread the comment you replied to. It literally says Osha was knowledgeable and well-read \"compared to sadhguru\" I'm just saying that comment is valid and your reply doesn't refute it Can someone explain to me or give me some examples/articles that discuss why he is upsetting the Indian Minority Community? My friend, an Indian woman, said, \"I cannot talk about this with you. He is a controversial figure for the Indian Minority,\" and so I am on the search to find out what's going on. Anyone who teaches you something relevant without the thought of using you. Pls suggest some that you have read. Wtf. The video is removed now?? I‚Äôm in UAE, I can still access it. Maybe it‚Äôs blocked in India? Yes, perhaps. Jeez it's fucked up. (I saw Sadhguru in Ambanis wedding, make sense, honestly, it's turning dictator by day) Maybe he filed for defamation and the courts ordered it, idk man Will you let me test you over a phone call or personal meet? I need someone like you.. hahaha What is OSHA‚Äôs scam Definitely copied Osho, the expensive, all the time different, clothes. The prolonged s on the end of words. Though Osho probably did that because off to much tranquilizers. An intelligent clown. Abuser of ignorant minds. How to stop these kind of criminals. An insult to Hinduism and ancient wisdom you idiot, you are hooked to cigarettes because cigarettes causes chemical experiences which is stronger than your will. Certain meditations taught by Sadhguru creates even more stronger and ecstatic chemical experiences, where you can stop smoking within a month P.S I was a chain smoker WTF, do you even have 3 working brain cells, if so please prove your statement, dont paste some stupid news articles etc, post valid evidence from court, law etc,because majority of the Indian news channels are run by propaganda I have watched it, and its carefully scripted narrative with cleverly hidden evidences, I have been to Isha ashram and I can vouch with my life, you dont have to believe me at the same time you shouldn't beleive a youtube video either just take some effort and explore instead of stupidly making conclusions that are not even right This is stupid, Sadhguru is the one who always beats down the idea of heave, hell and god and he does not claim to be one either. Followers have made him godlike because the immensity of transformation they have seen in their lifes. and it is a silly idea saying god is everywhere or nowhere, because let me break it to you there is no god, there are no miracles but technologies either you can use it or make stupid conclusions like above Its like saying aliens doesn't exist, have you searched for a guru? if so how much effort did you put? oh I am sorry i did not consider the fact that you have a mind of a 7 year old co-cola which is bad for you spends millions of dollars in ads, yoga which is life transforming shouldn't I market it? As we can't prove the existence of god, we also can't prove the non-existence of god as well. That's why I have added both possibilities. you proved god, so what about it? Are people's mind in here so silly, no wonder people here are not able to understand Sadhguru, I am ok with people being idiots, I am ok with people being arrogrant, But I am definitely not ok with people being both. If you are an idiot atleast be humble and try to seek or explore rather than making stupid conclusions Everyone is free to make choices and opinions. There's no need to belittle anyone for not liking what you like. We can still be civil in disagreement. You know, 2 people can have opposite opinions and both can still be intelligent. One doesn't have to be stupid for the other to feel right. What's wrong in not liking Sadhguru? I am not saying that I hate him, I only said that no human should be revered as a god. You can still like and follow what he says, I just don't believe that anyone should consider them as god. Even if someone still prays to him, be my guest. We can agree to disagree. We don't have to be petty about it. It's okay for other to have different opinions. When did I prove god? I just told that I have 2 opposite opinions about god at the same instance. I can't believe either. Can I not have that opinion? One doesn't need to have a conclusion all the time, there's nothing wrong in having strong yet inconclusive understanding of something. woah woah, hold one , the statement you proved god, was rhetorical. I meant to say if you manage to prove god and you are successful , so what about it? if it doesn't in some way leaves you transformed.The idea that Sadhguru thinks himself is ridiculous and false, and you think that his devotees consider him as god, maybe , but do you know why, no but you have made a stupid conclusion that those people are stupid and gullible. Two intelligent men can have different opinion, but having stupid opinions like the above ones doesn't make somebody intelligent but stupid. As I said I am ok with stupidity but people reaffirming their stupid opinions is arrogance and I am not ok with both those qualities in combination. And lastly everyone is free to have opinions but if you try to abuse or put down Sadhguru in any way, shape or form, I will have to put my opinion across in a more jarring way I never said anything to put him down. I only said that no matter what he would be, he isn't god, because no human is god. I have no issues with anyone, unless someone compares them to god. Not just Sadhguru, I would respect and agree with anyone if they say a right or good thing. Not being a god, doesn't demean anyone. That's as normal as calling them human. And human errs. Unless I say anything derogatory, one mustn't feel offended. The people who hated osho were politicans, dogmatic religious people who couldn‚Äôt take his criticism of religion, osho was contraversial in a rebellious way because he was the truth. Sadguru is a conartist. He copies osho and there is nothing similar about them. I cannot blame you because you have not the eyes to see a true guru like Osho. Those who have eyes to see could clearly pick out the fraud Sadguru. He‚Äôs a liar and a carbon copy NPC. He cares about fortune, he‚Äôs solely a business man who knows how to rip people off, not Osho. Why do you seem to feel Osho was a saint? What about all those cases of rape, child rape, violence and other incidents which were reported in his ashram? What about the time when they decided to use bio weapons against innocent people just to win an election? I don‚Äôt understand why do people support cult leaders? They just make money for themselves and cult always leads to blind following and ends up badly as people lose their ability to critically think and question their leaders. And, that‚Äôs exactly what Kamdev would say‚Ä¶ Shambo üôè Hello? He is called SadGuru for a reason That conman disgusts me. He's a charlatan like 'Satya' Sai Baba and Nityananda. As J.Krishnamurti puts it, you are the guru, you are the disciple. Please join r/conmangodman to share your scammy baba stories and help others get out of these cults. Spend time with con men. They think just like sahdguru does. Thinking they can say anything and people will believe it. And chuckling at how dumb they are. And it just reinforces and strengthens their confidence in their conning ability. They feel so much confidence because they know how dumb people are, how desparate, and how gullible, and if they say that theyre enlightened and dress the part, and talk the part, most people will believe them, and hand over their money. they are comparing a genuine philosopher like osho to a copycat India is not for kids either osho was not a fake guru he had his own philosophy way ahead of his times he created his own city in the USA here CM of India wouldn't get us a visa read osho Watch Wild Wild Countries on Netflix watch his insights his discourse on YouTube his foundation osho international and then u will find all are fake including osho but osho was the best of all the spiritual leaders cuz he didn't promoted any religion Let's look at the evidence regarding what Sadhguru did in the world and decide whether he is a fraud or not?

Stop making baseless statements.Can you prove your statement with facts, that Sadhguru is fake? The main issue comes when anyone thinks that a video on YouTube is well-researched. But instead is just propaganda in hiding. With not many proofs, just a story, weaved to fool everyone. Another issue is the people would downvote you when you reveal their propaganda instead of questioning. They may say they are logical but instead just have other intentions. Let's look at the evidence regarding what Sadhguru did in the world and decide whether he is a fraud or not?

Stop making baseless statements.Can you prove your statement with facts, that Sadhguru is fake or a fraud? Seems like spicy news sells more than the truth itself. What to say we have trained everyone to think negative about people who are doing positive for our country. What courses these gurus may offer is like a buffet. Eat what suits you, no need to get upset if there are some dishes you don't like. U might wanna eat what u like, and also try a lil of something new, which u think u might like. Applies to both osho, sadhguru & all others. Osho was supposed to have been involved in sex scandals. Don't know too much about him other than this. Sadhguru has been accused of killing his wife, of which he was acquitted. And also that he usurped elephant corridor, and I don't know which that is. If anyone thinks he's a criminal, y not take him to court, instead of believing rumors repeated a thousand times? We r not barred from using our brains. Just coz someone is my guru, doesn't mean I should blindly believing what he or she says. I have a couple of spiritual masters in my life and I have my disagreements with them, on various matters, yet, the respect and gratitude remains, coz at some point in my life, they were the guiding light. They are not God, they are humans. Treat them as such. I took their guidance, however suitable to me. They didn't coerce me into their ways either. I'm not a zombie and so aren't they. I refuse to be a part of any cult, and choose to think for myself. I suggest that instead of fretting over ppl who follow anyone blindly, let's concentrate on making our lives better :) Based on my experience, I can say that I have benefited from the yoga and meditation practices taught by him. When I struggled to find a solution for my life situation, Inner Engineering brought me a lot of physical and mental balance. Now Along with medication and meditation practices, I am getting better day by day. I've seen this video before but I could never trust the YouTube channel especially because at that time it had only this video. How do you even make such a documentary without any experience in making such videos and also no ad revenue prior to that? Please do your due diligence by researching on your own for anything. Just by looking at someone's youtube video people judge somebody who they don't Know at all. When the court has declared him not a criminal then why do people still go on accusing him of some thing or the other. It's rightly said the tree which bears most ripe fruits are stoned always. Just do Inner Engineering program once with open heart and mind and then ask yourself and you'll get the answer Simply because of those who does his practices sincerely get's results gets profound experience nothing more nothing less, you know how he talks about voidness in shoonya just pick up do the practices and if that doesn't happen then for you he is fraud that scammed you, if it does then you know you know it by experience even if God comes here say otherwise, it's clear within you it's as simple as that...by talking/arguing you can go as much far as you want but you are essentially just going round and round and rounnd.. And a murderer to boot! Fraudulent liar ü§• Soon too be nabbed by Feds !!! his time is up I think generally most people don't care and tend to focus more on what he is saying, and what he says does feel sensible and transformative at times. He is very charismatic and there is some substance to his ideas and thinking. In terms of everything else, we need money to survive in this world - and I think we all expect a 'guru' to live in a grass hut and eat oats and live humbly and simply - this is the image we hope for our gurus - to need nothing in this world and to want for nothing. I think the misnomer here is what 'enlightenment' actually is. These people are still human beings in a physical world. The yare not deities or gods - they are starkly human and they all are very clear about that. Absolutely fake! The question is, how can he be shut down permanently. A lot of families whose women and men started following his crap are a mess. he gives same answers, when asked differently he mocks the person who asked the question. it is so irritating to see him in his luxurious cars and watches. whereas a guru, enlightened would never care about such stuff even if his supporters ‚Äúgifted‚Äù him, he could say, instead of these gifts provide direct money to NGOs or for his own sadhnas that people pay thousands of dollars to enrolls into. It‚Äôs so sad man! YEAH BECAUSE NEW LAUNDARY IS LEFTIST AND SOROS FUNDED ORANISATION All people here talking on a website, judging a man and giving their version about life, gurus, religion, what God is. I know you won't admit, and might come up with a funny reply or just belittle me. But make yourself better, and preach what you do. People say this is cringe that is cringe(And they just might be). So don't be a spectator and pass judgements, life's too big to hate or judge anyone over the internet.(Sorry for judging you all, but I think some people would benefit and might get more self aware). Humans are part of bhagwan, nature, Jesus, So let's bring glory to his land, love everyone. (And not spread hate) Osho was just a ba graduate and ba graduates can't even crack an entrance exam Meditation has even a short effect hormonal only if done long term...may be fake jagi is mixing some thing that is injurious to your health Oshos followers murdered people in his name. Osho molested women. Osho was a rich bitch and a cult leader. They are comparing a fraud to a monster Okay Yet in this instance the world remembers him as a cult leader and a fraud. There are always people who who see radical anti establishment people and think the inherent corruption of the system makes that person good. Hitler was an anti establishment radical, some people still think he was great, most don‚Äôt. People all but worship Lenin and he was a monster. Does it make their broader points necessarily wrong? Not entirely. But they were both morally reprehensible hypocrites and liars despite having legitimate criticisms of the status quo. Osho was led away in chains by federal agents because his followers were terrorists > > if you'd rather ignore ideas that don't fit neatly into a \"good person\" mold, that's on you. Just don't confuse that with genuine intellectual openness. video got privated lol yeah right,swastika, keep believing that bullshit. This guy goes around bashing the ideas of ‚Äúheaven‚Äù and devotees saying god will not lift his little finger for you. Then he goes on attempting to convert modern people into devotees/monks which he use them freely as well as consecrated a ‚Äúdeity‚Äù devi. So ppl can worship. Like wrf There seems to a lot of debate around this, so I want to share my experience: I discovered Sadhguru on YouTube around 6-7 years ago when I was struggling with heavy joint inflammation due to years of suffering from a panic attack disorder. I was also addicted to hashish and suffered from depression and PTSD. I googled \"how to deal with anxiety\" and found a video of his. This led me to his 5-minute morning meditation, which after doing I immediately went \"wow....\" because of the instant relief. Never before had I experienced something so effective. Then I found his 15-minute Isha Kriya meditation, which was even more effective. My, what an immense relief. For the first time I possessed a technique that directly connected me to that which is beyond body and mind and my life was forever changed. This was the catalyst that led to my awakening a few years later, which was the most wonderful blast of pure love and ecstacy. I spoke to God, he told me the soul is eternal and that love is the fundamental energy of the universe, all hardships merely exist on top of the infinite foundation of love and bliss that existence, God, is. Now if you disbelieve what I just said, of course you're going to disbelieve Sadhguru and all other spiritual persons, and see spiritual practices as occult, manipulative, harmful and evil. That's obvious. Either you know or you dont, either you are spiritually tuned or not. Anyone who is not spiritually tuned will obviously see these things as completely insane, that is highly logical. However, this is my honest experience. I am not paid by Isha, I live in Norway and have never been in contact with anyone from the Isha foundation other than Sadhguru himself through videos. Now, this is the important bit: Continuing to do Isha Kriya regularly, the weight of depression and PTSD slowly faded. My panic attacks became fewer and farther inbetween. I still remembering saying to myself \"I am not this body, I am not even this mind\" and feeling immense relief on a daily basis. I am eternally grateful for this effective yogic key. Now I'm doing Shambavi Mahamudra and am enjoying immense benefits of that aswell. On top of the practices, his philosophies and teachings have brought me immense peace, joy and happinness in a world that only ever told me \"life is a bitch and then you die\". Before him, everyone ever said \"this life is it, you eat, shit, fuck and die\". Like we are animals... How sad. I'm sure the Sadhguru haters deep down believe this depressing fact and are immensely jealous of those who have escaped this illusion and found even a glimpse of the truth of God. Today, I have become free from my 15-year long hashish addiction. I have no desire to get high, have meaningless sex, eat junk food, binge-watch tv, play video games, nothing like that. It's completely faded into a blissful, open, radiant silence where I am present with my own being every second of every day. I am enjoying a wonderful, peaceful life where I need nothing or noone to be happy. This is largely thanks to my guru and others like him who teach the wisdoms of eternity. Thank you for reading <3 much love to all, even the haters. One day you will understand. Until then, we will simply wait. When the day comes, you will be embraced with the open arms of total forgiveness and unconditional love. Namaste. Christianity, Islam, Hindu etc are all bullshit I find him very insightful and I‚Äôm guessing that it‚Äôs religious people who dislike him because he challenges conventional thinking and religious nonsense."
