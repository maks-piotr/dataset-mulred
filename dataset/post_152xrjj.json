People starts fundraiser likes its nothing! \nI do donate money! But you people who seriously needs it   \n\nMy father is alcoholic and we struggle financially but we never went to some ngo or started a fund raiser.. meri mummy used borrowed money from relatives and always returned the money whenever she had some , i dont usually borrow money but when i do i return them as soon as well and with little extra everytime , I work hard so i can repay all the karja .. i can easily start a fund raiser but I don't instead I work hard",

Your ignorant and   immature comments are inexcusable unless you are a 12 year old spoilt brat.\n\nOP had already posted biopsy report in the link which confirms the carcinoma. \n\nYou have no clue about the disease and what kind of physical, mental toll it has on the people who have to take care of the patient. I happen to have my aunt treated and its not pretty.\n\nOnce endometrial cancer reaches stage 4, surgical options are often meaningless  and your only chance is chemo and radiotherapy and you have a survival rate of  15%.\n\nWhat does your father being an irresponsible alcoholic has anything to do with this context. Everyone has their own personal situations and hardships including me.  \n\nSave your preaching for when your mother gets cancer and you have to stay at home to take care of her and you don't have enough income to get her treated. Then you can brag how you would rather let your mother die because you are too proud to do whatever you need to do you save her.",
