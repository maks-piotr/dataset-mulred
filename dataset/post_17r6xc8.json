Beryl Rawson, pp. 79–98. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-814918-2]. The punishments for breaking these limits were harsh; men's faces were cut to disfigure them, et cetera. [Edwards, Catharine (1993). The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome. Cambridge University Press]. In East Rome the minimum age for females was raised to 13, to reflect the Persian customs. Those two empires, the Persian and East Roman, dominated the Middle East and lay the foundation for essentially all legal norms in the region. There exists no evidence in the historical record for child marriage being \"the norm\".\n\n\"There exists no evidence in the historical record for child marriage being \"the norm\".\n\n>I guess your parents never bought you an English book.

Let me educate you.\n\n**In the 1800s, the age of consent in the US was 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of Delware, where it was seven.**\n\n[Source.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States)\n\n**The legal history, for England though very complicated, can be summarized: the age of consent for girls was 12 in the 13th century, but was lowered to 10 in 1576, and remained there until it was raised to 12 in 1861, then to 13 in 1875, and then to 16 in 1885. One could enter into a Common Law marriage at the age of 12.**\n\n[Source.](https://rictornorton.co.uk/though16.htm#:~:text=The%20legal%20history%2C%20though%20very,at%20the%20age%20of%2012)\n\n**The legal age of consent in India was 10 years till 1860**\n\n[Source.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/oct/11/did-you-know-that-the-legal-age-of-consent-in-1860-was-10-years-1671391.amp)\n\nLook at the history of Indian hindu kings. They married women below 18. It's funny how untouched with reality you are.\n\n>Are you saying just bcz she got puberty she is no longer a child?\n\nYes, that is the physical evidence, you buffoon. Since you never passed primary school, here's another lesson for you and make sure you take notes:\n\n**At puberty, the pituitary gland (in the central part of the brain) starts making hormones that stimulate the ovaries to make female sex hormones, including estrogen. The secretion of these hormones causes a girl to develop into a sexually mature woman.**\n\n[Source.](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/female-repro.html#:~:text=At%20puberty%2C%20the%20pituitary%20gland,into%20a%20sexually%20mature%20woman.)\n\n>Well in that case let me tell you there are case where girl have got puberty at 1 yr old soo please don't come up sith another disgusting excuse\n\nShow me your proof when a 1 yr old hit puberty.\n\n>Only one who's butthurt here is you and what are you facts anyway?

There has to be a mother right if he's father? But there is literally none cuz she's literally other half of energy of him \n\nYeah, right. As if he didn't fuck her. Talk about having the same wife and daughter. Who's disgusting now. If your morals are so high, why are you defending this? Amazing. It's just amazing.\n\n>You talk a lot of shit for a muslim who doesn't even knows both Christians and Muslims beleive in adam and eve that's why earlier i said I don't take your shit seriously 😂 \n\nDamn, I've you're one of the biggest idiots I've ever met.

You're quite clearly illiterate. \n\n>Buddy i hope you rethink this one after my response\n\nI don't need to. I think you're an illiterate hypocrite with double standards.

Naive of me to presume otherwise. I can't make out if you forgot /s. Is it worthy of watching in 2023? Is it worthy of watching in 2023? After the idiots finish celebrating whatever brain dead festival they celebrate, we common citizens need to either file an FIR or repair it ourselves. कोशिश कीजिये मगर याद रखिये.. इस देश में आवाज़ उठाने वालो के साथ क्या सलूक होता है। [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road\\_House\\_(upcoming\\_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_House_(upcoming_film)) You could watch this one instead. They have remade it. Not released yet. I have no issues with anyone celebrating their religion & beliefs. Infact the cities light up in diwali, durga puja and eid (now-a-days some places in Christmas too). It is a part of being Indian. It is an unique experience which you can only get in this country. Unfortunately the problem lies with the lack of civic sense & sense of duties in individuals irrespective of religion. Be it parking or encroachment on footpath, digging up or blocking roads or the entitlement attitude towards everything. Even if common folks repair the roads themselves using gravel, mud or cement, it starts deteriorating at accelerated pace at the point of damage ultimately leading to bigger potholes. Thanks. Adding to the long weekend list :) मैं किसी के खिलाफ नहीं जाना चाहता. यदि संबंधित अधिकारी पर्याप्त सतर्क होते तो यह स्थिति नहीं होती। मैं बस यही चाहता हूं कि मेरी सड़कें बनी रहें क्योंकि हम 7-8 साल से अधिक समय तक उचित सड़कें पाने के लिए संघर्ष करते रहे. काश, कोई सरल ऑनलाइन पोर्टल होता जहां कोई व्यक्ति गुमनाम रूप से ऐसे छोटे मुद्दों की रिपोर्ट कर सकता और संबंधित अधिकारी उस पर कार्रवाई करते। >whatever brain dead festival they celebrate Ofc a kerala guy says it Indiaaaaaaaahh, incredible indiaaaaa.. These small things add up and common people gets irritated, and when they leave the country they get the tag of \"Brain Drain\". Instead of blaming citizens government should focus on real development rather than just \"Divide and Rule\" Same happened in my locality. They dug the road for Durga Puja \"Pandal\" and didn't even cared to repair that. Now there are other types of pipes/rods coming where we don’t need to dig the holes in road, I know because I have hosted 1 function recently. The guys who have done this probably don’t have the knowledge of it or they don’t want to put money. Govt/ police must need to make aware the citizens about new ways and need to ban these old ways The locals there should make sure that they do not vote for any politicians whose fugly faces are on the banners to be installed there Shabdo pe mat jaao bhavna samjo Bhai sarcasm overflow ho raha hai already... /s karke swaad bigad jaega. The same people will complain about paying taxes because the roads have potholes. You can't do anything, no one will listen and complaingin to Mc will get you this answer. \"Sir ye hamare department ki responsibility nahi hai aap doosre vibhaag me ja kar shikayat karain.\" Nah bro these wannabe intellectual fuckers should be called out, had another guy from kerala saying sanatan dharma values cows lives more than human lives then i asked where does it say and not to talk shit without knowing anything Mfs downvoted me and he never replied💀 Somebody had brought this up in r/pune during Ganpati and many people's first line of defence was \"Just 10 din ke liye adjust nahi kar sakte?\" And this is exactly what I had said then - its never just 10 din. There's Ganpati, then Navratri, then Diwali, then Christmas, then Republic Day, then Independence Day, iski jayanti, uski jayanti, and the half dozen Eids sprinkled throughout the year - this country is an endless procession of inconveniences for its most honest and loyal citizens. Roads ki cha modne ki ninja technique This is why we have a very long way ahead to match the quality of life in developed countries. Even if a very high quality infrastructure is developed, a few dumbwits will ruin it for temporary, small gain and then we are stuck in perpetual cycle of damaging and fixing the infrastructure. So much time, money, energy is lost in such trivial matters. These same organisers and decorators do the same work every year, multiple times on multiple occasions. I wonder how not even one among the thousands of participants who attend these functions/events never point this out. I'm sure even if a few handful people complain everytime, the organizers and decorators will look for alternatives. If a Dalit person is caught a smuggling a cow in UP, he will be lynched. I can bet on it. And on your same brain dead logic, where does it say that a Kerela guys hate festivals. Absolutely agree. Swatch baharat abhiyaan was a brilliant initiative to inculcate good hygienic practices among the citizens. Same with 'Har Ghar Sauchalay Yojana', brought tremendous change in our society (specially rural). Next is 'Har Ghar Jal'. I guess India is not ready yet to learn about civic responsibilities & fundamental duties. We are still focused on minimum bare necessities like toilets & access to water. The rich can anytime leave the country but middle class is stuck here. Ofcourse if even after 75 years of Independence we are stuck here, all political parties are collectively responsible for this. That interesting to know. I've seen aluminium (or maybe aluminium) frames which do not require digging but never with bamboo. Maybe people still practice this method to save money. Also most folks don't even think twice digging roads & footpaths because of their absolute disregard for public property and lack of any moral & civic sense. I thought he was being serious lol. Shut up dude. He's probably just another dude who wants to spread hate against kerala. I think we all should talk about these issues. Nobody really cares about the problems we are having. People are simply busy with what they are doing. I'd like to disagree. Festivals are instead occasions for joy & celebration. It is our fellow countrymen with absolute disregard for anyone & anything who ruin these festivals. Lack of civic sense, basic etiquettes, morals, hygiene, compassion & respect towards the nation ruin everyday lives of a law abiding honest citizen. It is high time we try to change this culture and start talking more about it. Just learned the meaning of /s now. 😁 Isme kya h, baap ka sadak h Arey ek baar ke kaam se ek baar hi commission milega. Kaam bar bar hote rehna chahiye, commision ate rehna chahiye. Logo ka kya hai, wo mandir banta dekh khus hai aur adjust karneki addat pad gyi hai aur better life ki umeed rakhte nhi aur chahiye bhi nahi >Festivals are instead occasions for joy & celebration. I don't have any problems with festivals. >Lack of civic sense, basic etiquettes, morals, hygiene, compassion & respect towards the nation Exactly what I'm criticizing too. >high time we try to change this culture and start talking more about it. I'm 37 years old. I gave up long ago. My only wish in life is to pay off my home loan and die from choked arteries like I always wanted to. I don't see that happening anytime soon. With unlimited funds, political parties have no lack of money to spend on banners and such. We'd have been a better country already if voters votes on real issues which would help build the nation. Voters are not dumb but their priorities do not align with the development of our country. That's why we rank so low on Happiness Index. Any law abiding honest citizen feels like being at the wrong place at the wrong time in this country. >If a Dalit person is caught a smuggling a cow in UP, he will be lynched Every country has problems with extremism remember what happened when nupur sharma qouted that muhammad raped a 9 yr old (he did) and every one went crazy? But what does it has to do with my comment >where does it say that a Kerela guys hate festivals. almost everyone i have encountered on this sub or r/india who are unnecessarily talking shit about religion are from kerala Someone suggested the following: > wait to see who puts up their banner on the structure. > After ownership has been decided, file an rti for just 10 rupees to your city's civic body asking about permission to dig up/pbstruct the road and if no permission has been taken what penal action was taken. I wonder of I should go this route too. No one's spreading hate against kerala but most people i have encountered who wrre unnecessarily talking shit about religion were from kerala Just adds to the ugliness of the background. The fact that our justice system is also insanely slow due to extreme backlogs and incompetent police department, seeking legal action is like punishable oneself. All it would do is suck me into the system and draw the life out of me before I could get the guilty punished. This country's judiciary & police need reforms urgently. That is the only thing stopped us from leapfrogging towards becoming a developed nation. Yeh mera India, I love my India! This reminds me of a Sanskrit proverb I learned from School. The translation was something like: *”What’s the point of bathing a pig with finest sandalwood? He will eventually roll around in the mud.”* Same music ran in my mind lmao Very well said. Atleast kaam baar baar ho toh people will even tolerate this. This is a small area situated on the outskirts of a small industrial town. People suffered everyday due to bad roads for almost 10 years until we got this road repaired in 2012-13. And unnecessarily repaved in 2015 along with proper footpath and everything. Issue is baar baar toh bante hi nahi hai roads yaha even after countless written complains and newspaper articles. It is ultimately people who keep suffering. I have no issues with mandir and all. Anyways it was Supreme court who directed to build the mandir. I have issues with the system - political, judiciary & police. The system is designed to make the people suffer. It is BHARAT bro! “India” is a name given our colonial masters. People will say you forgot the '/s', but the sad reality is this statement is a real representation of the state of the country. Did he lie though. You Fuckers would be the first to insult other religions but when someone criticizes your holy oldest religion a bit you all loose your mind. Grow up and get over \"Kerala and TN bad because they criticize our great tanatan drum\", start taking criticisms and stop making such beautiful culture a dumpster fire >Did he lie though Yes he did >You Fuckers would be the first to insult other religions but when someone criticizes your holy oldest religion Criticism is welcomed talking shit,isn't.Too hard to understand for your brain? >Grow up and get over \"Kerala and TN bad because they criticize our great tanatan drum\", As I said critisize all you want but don't expect flowers when you are talking shit >stop making such beautiful culture a dumpster fire No one's making dumpster fire.Don't expect flowers when you are spewing filth about my religion So why should we keep calm when you are criticizing our states just because our practices and belief system is different from yours. We don't use religion us a tool to start riots or for segregation like you uneducated fucks. Also I don't have enough free time like you to reply to each and every single baseless criticizm of yours. Go live in your fairytale Third world country for a reason What the actual f..... Well the labour who dig this did not go to school or anything. So cannot think in the long run like how you are thinking. >So why should we keep calm when you are criticizing our states Lol when did I criticize your state,are you illiterate 😂😂 >our practices and belief system is different from yours. We don't use religion us a tool to start riots or for segregation like you uneducated fucks Ohh yeah yeah there comes wE ArE BeTTeR tHaN YOu bCz wE ArE EdUCAteD It's the classic >uneducated fucks.

My family home colony(delhi). They made a rule beginning of 00's that all support beams can't be put up by digging the road/park etc. So they used metal rods with circular flat bottoms that didn't damage the road. Why did you assume that the original commentor meant Hindu festivals that you had to bring up the Nupur Sharma case? It's the blind hate and no \"critical thinking\" which makes you go for whataboutism when someone criticizes your views >that muhammad raped a 9 yr old (he did) and every one went crazy? Funny how your double standards and hypocrisy work. You said this: >sanatan dharma values cows lives more than human lives then i asked where does it say and not to talk shit without knowing anything Where does it say anywhere? Give your source. BTW, what happened between brahma and saraswati? >almost everyone i have encountered on this sub or r/india who are unnecessarily talking shit about religion are from kerala Oh, so you want sources for others, but when it comes to your subjective opinions and feelings, are you all that matter? Did I call out your double standards and hypocrisy yet? Nothing has changed since I lived in India. I was working as security. I knew it was fucked up when I was given a pistol that couldn’t get through a single magazine without a malfunction. Welcome to India 🇮🇳 >Why did you assume that the original commentor meant Hindu festivals Which major festival is coming up? And is it appropriate to call someone's festival braindead?? >It's the blind hate and no \"critical thinking\" which makes you go for whataboutism when someone criticizes your views My point was every religion has problem with extremism and i gave an example,what are you even blabbering about😂 >Where does it say what you claimed? Give your source Sahih al-Bukhari 5134 : that the Prophet (ﷺ) married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that `Aisha remained with the Prophet (ﷺ) for nine years (i.e. till his death). Sahih al-Bukhari 6130 : I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13) >BTW, what happened between brahma and saraswati? I knew you would resort to this actually it's pretty easy to understand but here you go • people focus on the puranas,They are just metaphorical stories to explain a particular •The dawn (Usha) of the Rig Veda is feminine and is meant to represent the enlightenment that arises when darkness has been eliminated.

(Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13) And?!? She married him when she reached puberty as she herself mentioned. Or did you not read that part? Funny, how you take a hadith from Aisha r.a., take what part justifies your bigotry and hatred and leave the rest. Wonder why that is!!! If these were your big gotcha moment, you're definitely a melon. So, I'll ask again where your proof that he rped her. >I knew you would resort to this actually it's pretty easy to understand but here you go >• people focus on the puranas,They are just metaphorical stories to explain a particular >•The dawn (Usha) of the Rig Veda is feminine and is meant to represent the enlightenment that arises when darkness has been eliminated.

Again, since you chose to use a strawman and not answer me, I'll ask again. What happened between them? Considering they are father and daughter. >I can give you my sources of claims dm me if you want although I'm not gonna dm you. If you have sources, put it here. Otherwise, keep on showing your double standards and hypocrisy. >Where does it say rped her? Do you live in delusions? Do words just appear on paper for you? Do you see Scooby-Doo, too? So if someone has sex with your 9 yr old daughter but she likes it and doesn't says to stop It's not rape? Do you wanna realise how disgusting you sound rn ?? Ngl bro I feel disgusted but not surprised >And?!? She married him when she reached puberty as she herself mentioned. Or did you not read that part? Funny, how you take a hadith from Aisha r.a., take what part justifies your bigotry and hatred and leave the rest. Wonder why that is!!! Are you illiterate?? Can you not read the verse Sahih al-Bukhari 5134 Translation Source : Read any reliable translation you like He fucked her after she got puberty married her before she got it \"READ YOUR SCRIPTURES\" >take what part justifies your bigotry and hatred and leave the rest. Wonder why that is!!! Just stfu and read your own scriptures before Running your mouth here >Since you chose to use a strawman and not answer me, I'll ask again. What happened between them? Considering they are father and daughter You lack a lot intellect (sorry if it hurts you) nothing happened between them >What happened between them? Considering they are father and daughter Even this logic is bullshit..if she is his daughter who's the mother? God created eve out of Adam's ribs does that makes them brother sister or father and daughter? I am ignorant about it but does it explain why there is soo much in breeding between muslims? :/ My brother,Turn to your lord jesus christ ✝️ He is the only way to heaven not your false prophet muhammad ✝️ Surely there are people who are higher in hierarchy who are involved in this. There is contractor/decorators and the puja/event management committee. It is all about having a little conscience and respect for the country. Even an illiterate labour can have a sense of basic civic duties but if forced to do such insane tasks, I don't think he'd have much choices. >So if someone has sex with your 9 yr old daughter but she likes it and doesn't says to stop >It's not rape? Do you wanna realise how disgusting you sound rn ?? Ngl bro I feel disgusted but not surprised You're so dumb, but it's not surprising. Do you really think 1400 yrs ago, the age to get married was 18? Hahaha!!! Go 300 or 400 hundred years back, and women were married at 10-12. Do read up sometimes. It'll help you not make a fool of yourself. >Are you illiterate?? Can you not read the verse >Sahih al-Bukhari 5134 Translation Source : >Read any reliable translation you like >He fucked her after she got puberty married her before she got it \"READ YOUR SCRIPTURES\" I guess your parents never bought you an English book. Man, you're really illiterate, aren't you? Where does it say in the link you posted that he consummated the marriage before she hit puberty. You're really setting the bar for how dumb a person can be. Even your own translation doesn't say what you said. Talk about you being a version of dumb meets dumber. >Just stfu and read your own scriptures before Running your mouth here Owwww.....someone's getting butthurt cause he can't take facts. Boohoo, cry me a river. >Even this logic is bullshit..if she is his daughter who's the mother? How the hell should I know? Am I the hindu here? Stop deflecting and answer it instead of moaning like a coward. I'll ask again, since you're too chicken to answer. What happened between them? Where are your morals now? Aren't you disgusted by yourself, hypocrite? >God created eve out of Adam's ribs does that makes them brother sister or father and daughter? That's Christianity, you stupid melon.

So, I'll ask again: Since you're a broken record player, give me the sources of your claims, you hypocrite. > iski jayanti, uski jayanti lol. They do this for various parts of town where some weekly markets are set up, those roads have become increasingly terrible to drive on. look you and i know that those taxes are used to build substandard roads with ultra premium prices. Welcome to India :) >You're so dumb, but it's not surprising. Do you really think 1400 yrs ago, the age to get married was 18? Hahaha!!!

Ohh yeah classic try to drag every one in filth so that it looks like everyone lived in same filth what's the problem It was demonstrably not \"the norm\". In Rome -- prior to the split into West and East Rome -- the minimum age for marriage was 12 for females and 14 for males and Rome was unequivocally monogamous, and the upper classes were not exempt [Bradley, K.R. 1991. \"Remarriage and the Structure of the Upper-Class Roman Family\", In Marriage, Divorce, and Children in Ancient Rome, eds. Beryl Rawson, pp. 79–98. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-814918-2]. The punishments for breaking these limits were harsh; men's faces were cut to disfigure them, et cetera. [Edwards, Catharine (1993). The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome. Cambridge University Press]. In East Rome the minimum age for females was raised to 13, to reflect the Persian customs. Those two empires, the Persian and East Roman, dominated the Middle East and lay the foundation for essentially all legal norms in the region. There exists no evidence in the historical record for child marriage being \"the norm\". \"There exists no evidence in the historical record for child marriage being \"the norm\". >I guess your parents never bought you an English book.

Only one who's butthurt here is you and what are you facts anyway? That it's not rape is a 9 yr old child doesn't says no? >How the hell should I know? Am I the hindu here?

Aren't you disgusted by yourself, hypocrite? You talk a lot of shit that , no they didn't had sex and i explained what it means in my above response and I literally asked if she's daughter of bramha who's the mother? There has to be a mother right if he's father? But there is literally none cuz she's literally other half of energy of him But that whole 80% of that paragraph was just talking shit please do better from next time responses it wastes a lot of my time and I don't even take them seriously from a fool like you >That's Christianity, you stupid melon. Ask Christians about that. You talk a lot of shit for a muslim who doesn't even knows both Christians and Muslims beleive in adam and eve that's why earlier i said I don't take your shit seriously 😂 Here you go Quran 7:189:- He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful >Owwww.....guess you didn't get the memo saying, \" I don't care what your personal opinions are cause you've already shown how smart and intellectual you are.\" Buddy i hope you rethink this one after my response >I love that when you guys don't have anything to actually debate, you just start using your red herrings and logical fallacies.

So, I'll ask again: Since you're a broken record player, give me the sources of your claims, you hypocrite. I am sorry for this but about what claims you need sources for? Half dozen eids 💀 pretty sure there are only 2 eids >Ohh yeah classic try to drag every one in filth so that it looks like everyone lived in same filth what's the problem Damn, how can someone be this dumb. Let me educate you. **In the 1800s, the age of consent in the US was 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of Delware, where it was seven.** [Source.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States) **The legal history, for England though very complicated, can be summarized: the age of consent for girls was 12 in the 13th century, but was lowered to 10 in 1576, and remained there until it was raised to 12 in 1861, then to 13 in 1875, and then to 16 in 1885. One could enter into a Common Law marriage at the age of 12.** [Source.](https://rictornorton.co.uk/though16.htm#:~:text=The%20legal%20history%2C%20though%20very,at%20the%20age%20of%2012) **The legal age of consent in India was 10 years till 1860** [Source.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/oct/11/did-you-know-that-the-legal-age-of-consent-in-1860-was-10-years-1671391.amp) Look at the history of Indian hindu kings. They married women below 18. It's funny how untouched with reality you are. >Are you saying just bcz she got puberty she is no longer a child? Yes, that is the physical evidence, you buffoon. Since you never passed primary school, here's another lesson for you and make sure you take notes: **At puberty, the pituitary gland (in the central part of the brain) starts making hormones that stimulate the ovaries to make female sex hormones, including estrogen. The secretion of these hormones causes a girl to develop into a sexually mature woman.** [Source.](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/female-repro.html#:~:text=At%20puberty%2C%20the%20pituitary%20gland,into%20a%20sexually%20mature%20woman.) >Well in that case let me tell you there are case where girl have got puberty at 1 yr old soo please don't come up sith another disgusting excuse Show me your proof when a 1 yr old hit puberty. >Only one who's butthurt here is you and what are you facts anyway? That it's not rape is a 9 yr old child doesn't says no? You aren't even smart enough to have your own comebacks. Take another hit of thay copium. >You talk a lot of shit that , no they didn't had sex and i explained what it means in my above response and I literally asked if she's daughter of bramha who's the mother? There has to be a mother right if he's father? But there is literally none cuz she's literally other half of energy of him Yeah, right. As if he didn't fuck her. Talk about having the same wife and daughter. Who's disgusting now. If your morals are so high, why are you defending this? Amazing. It's just amazing. >You talk a lot of shit for a muslim who doesn't even knows both Christians and Muslims beleive in adam and eve that's why earlier i said I don't take your shit seriously 😂 Damn, I've you're one of the biggest idiots I've ever met. We believe in Adam doesn't mean our beliefs are the same. The part about Eve being born from the rib of Adam isn't in Islam. >Quran 7:189:- He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her.

Love to see how you can't even respond without posting it other places. >Where does it say rped her? Do you live in delusions? Do words just appear on paper for you? Do you see Scooby-Doo, too? What do you call someone \"consummating\" a marriage with a 9 yo child? Because on planet Earth, it's called RAPE. Not only that, but it endangers their lives. Does the god you worship condone and support rape now? If it's wrong now then how is it that your infallible god was okay with it then? u/devilcross2 You are defending the rape of children, so these must be the values that your mother, father, and your religion taught you. Tragedy of the commons. Bro jokes work on hyperbole. Just admit you wanna fuck a 9 year old and move on I just saw that in Mirzapur! >What do you call someone \"consummating\" a marriage with a 9-year-old child?

If it's wrong now then how is it that your infallible god was okay with it then? Show me your proof that a 9yrs old wasn't mature 1400 yrs ago. You guys are so dumb. You have no idea how the human body works and evolves and how the age of consent has changed over the years. I guess in a country where the age of consent is 16, you consider everyone living there to be a pedo. Very logical. Great!!! >u/devilcross2 You are defending the rape of children, so these must be the values that your mother, father, and your religion taught you. My parents taught me logical thinking. I'm not stupid to apply the rules of today to a society 1400 yrs ago. BTW, the age of consent in India is 1800s, and it was 10 years old. This is the difference between buffoons like you and me. I don't work on emotions but facts. So, cry me a river. I don't. Maybe you do. Talk about yourself. The \"common people\" are part of the problem. They engage in these kind of behaviors We can't really speak out against these since most of the usual \"pandals\" are put up for religious reasons, and complaining might offend people's beliefs. Additionally, many politicians use these bamboo banners for their promotion, and since they have influence, we find ourselves in a bit of a powerless situation. I hope this explains the whole situation Well all major parties like playing \"Divide and Rule\" and supporting particular \"caste or Religion\" for their vote bank. And the voters fall for this trap every 5 years! Yea, am talking about the common man who is setting these things up with attitude of \"humko kaun rokhega\" or \"chalega\""
