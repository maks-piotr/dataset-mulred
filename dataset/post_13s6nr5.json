    "selftext": "I heard a song a month or two back, it was a hindi Indie song by a female singer. Got the tune stuck in my head today randomly but I can't remember the name of the song or the artist, for the life of me. The music is somewhat EDM-ish (very Ritviz like), and in the lyrics the girl's asking whoever she's in love with to come and hurt her again. I guess some parts of the lyrics go like *Aao na*..... something something.....*dard deke jao na*  \n\nBeen trying to google those lyrics for an hour now but NOTHING, searched through all possible Spotify playlists but NOTHING. I think it's a fairly new song\n\n\nEDIT: Found it finally after endless browsing through Spotify: [Silly by Rii](https://open.spotify.com/track/1JouRQ8Ak8nwCKFXm7JojK?si=1vZjgPkDQ8eqapfdSs9B9A).",
