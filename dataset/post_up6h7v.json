        "Your lucky day.  They dropped the jukebox on youtube 1 day back. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/M3OM_w4aKRA\n\nSome of the songs are just amazing,  but they hit even more after the 'mahaul' has been set by the story.  ðŸ˜…",
        "This weekend I'm watching twin peaks again for second time.reall a masterpiece.",
        "I watched Everything Everywhere all at Once. Loved the movie. Itâ€™s a sci-fi movie with amazing action sequences while being a emotional roller coaster at the same time. The theme revolves around nhilism, and the act of kindness in face of nhilism.",
        "Watch Tomorrow Korean web series on Netflix. Pretty good, first series I watched through subtitles and its really good",
        "Watched a few movies after almost 2 years. Taxi 9211, Hasee to Phasee and Lakshya.",
        "Where did you watch it? Do you live outside India?",
        "Watched at a local theater, I live outside",
        "Sad i will never be able to see it in theatres. After Green Knight, they didn't release any A24 movie here.",
        "Dang that sucks. I think movie is really brilliant and lot of our generation could relate with it. Not to give the plot away, it revolves around a struggling asian family and lot of the family dynamics are something that I could see in our on culture. A kid looking for acceptance from her mom.",
        "Yeah I was so excited for EEAAO and The Northman, but they will never  get released here.",
        "The first episode of Modern Love (Season 2). Minnie Driver was phenomenal, the story quite poignant.",
        "Watched\n\n  \n\n\n1.saani kaayitham - soaring in technical aspects, absolutely brutal\n\n  \n\n\n2. Rocky (Tamil) - by the same saani kaayitham director debut movie - similar to saani kaayitham in all aspects but the single shots were a treat to watch\n\n  \n\n\n3. Puzhu (Malayalam) - got me depressed after watching the movie. My awe for Malayalam movies is increasing day by day. Starring mammooty without an ounce of heroism, no masala songs, comedy, fight. Movie based on caste discrimination.",

        "The Northman is available for streaming. EEAAO has its digital release on 17th May",
        "Puzhu was awesome. Captivating without any masala or over the top moments.\n\nIMHO, the movie talks about Caste discrimination and about men afraid of losing power (power play)",
