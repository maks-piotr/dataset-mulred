They have said 'new masala, more magic' there is no magic  in it, the magic that was there is not there anymore, I have written to their customer care and I have not got any reply. This is really sad, magic lays was a comfort food and this is causing a lot of issues to my mental health. 10rs ka packet I used to buy when I used to come back from work and it used to make me feel soo good. I don't know how I'm going to go ahead in life. FUCK YOU PEPSICO INDIA, You can't play with your customers like this.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Lawyers of India, can I sue lays for false advertising ?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "The new blue lays tastes like a fukin rip off of lays magic masala, if feels like their masala supplier is the same as balaji's supplier, I would literally short PepsiCo India stocks after tasting this atrocity. They have said 'new masala, more magic' there is no magic in it, the magic that was there is not there anymore, I have written to their customer care and I have not got any reply. This is really sad, magic lays was a comfort food and this is causing a lot of issues to my mental health. 10rs ka packet I used to buy when I used to come back from work and it used to make me feel soo good. I don't know how I'm going to go ahead in life. FUCK YOU PEPSICO INDIA, You can't play with your customers like this.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Lol, this company is literally poisoning people. Sure. Sue them for not fitting your taste, they're already dreaded Lmao that is so stupid, obviously you cannot sue them for it. New Masala Can Taste the same, Magic is really no parameter to measure taste in difference. I just recently made the switch to pringles, and I'm never looking back. Edit: removed the rest of text praising pringles to not make it look like I am pringles PR. Cricket may be a religion, but Magic Masala is our heart. To war with Lays! Boycott them! damn bro, you really do be feeling it üò≠ hey, on the bright side, they did say they're bringing back the old magic masala back so you can just sit tight till then ig? Bhai ke upne alag hi kalesh chalrahe hain. \"Sue\" them for what? You don't like it, that's why? Soja bhai ü§£ Yes.first rule of lawsuits. You can sue anybody anywhere for anything. Bro got a bit of 'tism It's causing emotional and mental harm, so yes. If they can sue companies and individuals that may come in their normal functioning why can't we Someone sued Red Bull for not giving them wings and they became a millionaire with a trophy wife. As always, shoot your shot - *where‚Äôs the magic?* Blue lays really lived long enough to becoming a villain Go for it but big corporations have a massive legal team and it'll just be a bunch of money going to waste. Would make for a funny af headline tho Start a gofundme or something. Youtube Law School graduate over here Not in India. If you bring frivolous law suits in India, you would be fined for wasting courts time. Lol People are so fragile nowadays It's ad man, don't take it literally just like girls don't chase you when you put on axe ü§£ü§£ü§£ Yeah because they are very busy serving people. nincompoops Choti bacchi ho kya? Yes. It‚Äôs same everywhere. Most lawsuits never see a day in court. They are paid off way before cause it‚Äôs cheaper for companies to pay off the party than go spend their time in courts. I worked with a company who paid off one individual every year just not to file a lawsuit instead of changing a product specification which would have cost millions. Haldiram's masala (blue one) tastes same and is much better, screw these billion dollar companies and have our own home made ones. They don't lack in quality now. Bold of you to assume that they respond to emails. I remember emailing to Parle 1-2 years back and they never responded back. Apparently Magic masala is coming back thanks to the rant that an influencer Bunshah had on Instagram. Lays got a lot of backlash and now it‚Äôs being reinstated üòÇ what a world Can you please elaborate on poisoning part. I am avid lays consumer Choose the non violent route, buy Patanjali noodles, it's full of magic masala. Bhai thodi km liya karo Don't want to criticize, but bhai bohot cheeze hai life mai karne ke liye aur khane ke liye. Don't waste your time on these things. Let's Sue them too!!! NAL. You can sue, but you won't win. I too mailed them, they'll call you in a week. They said they'll send a hamper, give feedback to the product team and would try to bring back the original taste. If it is fucking chips that causing you emotional and mental harm, i envy your life dude Lays Indian flavour was good till 2010, post that they ruined it. Pepsico is poisoning people with their beverages. It's already done dude - Wait..no one chases your after you put on axe? Usually the ladies chase me around quite a bit (you have to take their phone or their purse for the full effect of axe to work) Give it time buddy. Another 3 years or so, you'll get your response. First world problems in third world countries It's not just lays. All manufacturers in India have lowered their standards and are selling subpar products Wasn't there a guy in India who sued because his biscuit packet had one biscuit less? Was this in India or am I misremembering? You are right bud... \"This company is poisoning people\" \"Pls elaborate\" \"This company is poisoning people\" Thanks for elaborating mate I thought I was going fucking crazy. Glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is off. Cum* Are you saying that you can no longer get the original magic masala in India now? Cuz I can get [this big ass packet](https://imgur.com/gallery/r7qy9z9) in Canada. It might even taste better than what I remember from back in India. You will win the case and judge will award you million dollar settlement. The million dollars will come in a big suitcase. But you open the suitcase it‚Äôs just ten thousand rupees in there, and a Pok√©mon tazo. \"This n\\*gga has lost his composure\" That same masala is on everything French fries chips getting tiring. It‚Äôs like asking for noodles at an Indian restaurant doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs Hong Kong style or Indonesian they all taste the fuckin same You bought it right! That was the magic! I Lays my case your honor! Funny to see this as a foreigner. All I know about India is directly linked to my interest in Hinduism and Buddhism. Didn't know they are lays. But in the end it's also brahman. üòÖ Bro find some work Taste is a subjective thing not objective, it may taste better to some, no grounds for a legal case what magic they promised? pigeon out of packet? /s But... Taste is subjective While it's shitty of companies to do this (no surprise, companies only care about their bottomline), if your mental health hinges on a single packet of chips, you have bigger things to worry about. I'd suggest a therapist. And by poisoning, do you mean their drink has sugar? Or some specific chemicals that are killing us? Because by the first logic, every halwai in India is also killing us. The drinks are cancerous, as shown by the toilet cleaner community Pringles PR really focussing on Reddit. As companies grow they try to maximise profits by making manufacturing simpler/cheap/homogeneous it is same as to what happened with kfc and dominos. Lawsuit against a billion dollar mammoth that too in a \"developing\" country of 1.3 billion people, with your job will be shooting on foot. I'd say make a insta page or something to make people aware as it will gain traction sue them as a group, you can go to people and ask them to sign a petition about that and make a yt video out of it. That's all i can think of now. Bruv, what season of SUITS made you to do this ? Yes i felt the taste getting same like Balaji too. I love the Balaji taste so it was a win win for me I liked this more than the previous one. This is coming from supportive who's loved blue lays since 15 years if not more Don't eat lays. Not healthy at all! My question is how much time do you have to fight a case, it takes yearsssssssssssss They are under no obligation to provide you with chips. This is not an essential service protected by law. Please don't waste your time. bro tu /s lagana bhool gaya I am assuming OP has huge amounts of time in his hands.... Lol I would have never thought to file a case on masala used in chips. Buy bikaji chips, they are best chips rn out there No. ‚ÄúMore magic‚Äù is subjective, since there is no real definition / known usage of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù in the field of flavouring for chips. If you do ill -advisedly choose to file, you‚Äôll be slapped with cost most likely. Stop eating lays dude. Very bad for health !! My bad ü•≤ Damn can you send me some to Europe loll I‚Äôll pay for shipping and the chips *on his hands Whole my life, I wanted to Sue them for the air they sell Agree The case had a significant amount the company made as a result each day. Wtf did I just read.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Judiciary in India is so broken , you can sue anyone even if u don't have any proof as the case to get filed will probably take 100 years and waste your whole life to just prove your innocence. Hope u know Pringles aren't 'potato chips'. Read the ingredients next time. they're allowed to display anything in the front as long as the back contains the ingredient list and nutritional info. so i dont think you can do anything about it. Okay. That didn‚Äôt make any sense! what are they then? Disliked the cheesy cummy taste and have never ordered pringles since i miss lays baked Save the lawyer money and hire a therapist instead. Get a grip dude these are just some chips. People use mental health so casually these days with anything. If some masala gives you mental health issues then you seriously need to see some doctor. I actually didn't like the previous masala but something changed in the last few months and I love the new taste! I got like 20 packets in stock The usual industrial processed garbage, Check the ingredients, if you don't know where to pick or gather it, it's from a chemical plant. Usually glutamate, iodine (not the healthy kind from spinach ;)) and so on... Oh man you are right about the flavor, I thought I baught Balaji Masala and had to check the packet twice. I hate that sweet masala flavor of balaji masala. Old lays magic masala was perfect. All the comments shitting on op for no legitimate reasons. These corporations continue to blindly deliver a failure of a product and yet we are supposed to just deal with it?They are merciless moneymaking machines who would sue everything and everyone on a whim yet we are supposed to just sit there and take it?wow They've been selling us air packets since I remember. Yes, sue them. I tried this as well it‚Äôs bad Well, if you have the time and money to sue them over a packet of Rs 10 chips, then sure, go ahead. infinite money glitch Same bro‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Its literally the only flavour of chips I used to eat. there‚Äôs no more magic in the masala, just want the taste that was there 5yrs back. But on the bright side‚Ä¶now I have a healthier diet thanks to their shitty tasting chips. Lol, Bunshah reminded me of my classmate from school so I went and checked his insta... It was him only ü§£ I would sue them for supporting israel. PepsiCo also funds genocide >elaborate on poisoning part. Not an expert, but perhaps they're talking about the I'll effects of the parmolin oil generally used in such snacks I mean the air has use like... Preventing chips from breaking. Oh wait... Wow devastating news, mm was goat status Which company? Why aren't you using this information to make money from that company ? Tell me and I'm ready to share a %! What's the specification and what did he want to change it to?????? And what's the name of the company? Why lawsuit? Stop buying, let people stop buying. They'll reintroduce the original taste then. Something that had happened with coke a long time ago. Kar na OP.. maza ayega. Cause I have a soul my friend. Bingo Hashtags : Spicy Masala is the new blue lays. Plus, touch√©, they fucked up blue lays big time Just eat orange lays like normal people. Lol, have nothing to say and all you do is repeat ingredients? Where is the harmful stuff in the two ingredients you said? at least show something that's actually harmful. Hating something because you don't understand ingredients doesn't qualify it as harmful. I have one too. It hasn't done me any good. I have realized it's time to switch sides and watch the world burn :D That's what you have been told üòÇ yes, earlier this was the best lays now it is the exact replica of balaji wafers blue coloured chips &#x200B; hate it too Even legally speaking this isn't really a false advertisement, I seriously doubt that this case would be maintainable. Ten thousand rupees in 1000 rupee notes I came here just to ask how did this post got up vote button with sparkles around them nice look somehow make me wanna upvote for no reason.... I wrote this on some other rant on lays that they will take it back. They clearly can't lose the customer as it's a money making product. They will simply change back to the other vendor or replicate the old flavour with a new vendor as soon as the stock for the current production run gets over. Nope. Not even in US. Most ridiculous cases of successful lawsuits are either fake news or partial truths. What do you mean by its coming back? It never stopped coming Pretty lame reason for suing, if you ask me. Everybody knows that advertisements are bullcrap. Why did your first comment get more than 100 upvotes and this followup explanation is getting downvotes? Certified Reddit moment. Balajis taste is great for the price per weight ratio abey american ka choddal! üòÇ I literally threw the last pack couldn't imagine how they fucked it up so bad. There should be also a petition to stop use of pathetic palm oil use in all Indian products why do other countries enjoy products with good quality ingredients. you dont know what they were putting in the magic masala previously which made you addicted. maybe gov found out and banned it so lays had to change their whole recipe. It's always been shit. That‚Äôs why it tasted so different! It‚Äôs literally just sodium, fat and carbs. And the bad kind. They provide no good nutrition to the body. That‚Äôs common sense. If you love processed garbage so much, go eat only processed foods for a month. And check your blood test results before and after. I guarantee you it will be worse in every metric. There youtube videos about medical professionals who‚Äôve done it and it always leads to worsening of all metrics such as cholesterol, fat, a1c, etc And the damage to the body from junk food is slow but gradual so it manifests after 30s and 40s. And ALL kinds of processed food increases insulin resistance because there‚Äôs a sudden increase and decrease in blood glucose. You repeat that many times in a day, and it badly affects metabolic rate. Insulin resistance being high is linked with almost all diseases like heart, poor pancreatic functioning, kidney problems, poor metabolism, obesity, etc. Source : Idk which court will admit the matter and entertain it, but it‚Äôs not like it hasn‚Äôt been done before- So go off I guess, find a lawyer and register the case Oh Imma mail them too(for the hamper) because indian judicial system was never designed to bring justice FOR people. First make money and later become a Humanitarian lawyer who fights for human rights for free üòÇü§£. It's fast food man, you have packaged food conveniently available. Nice to have when needed, don't make a meal out of it? The quantities present in one packet, consumed responsibly should not do anything dangerous to you. Consume responsibly and have an overall healthy lifestyle. If you're a couch potato binging on junk, there are bigger things to worry about. It‚Äôs shit now man Without divulging company name, can you please tell us what spec or change we're talking about here? I'm so curious You can sue but you will definitely lose this one(if it didn't land with a nut judge). 1. Magic should not be taken literally, they will argue that are you even a sane person who falls for the word magic? Their lawyer will ask you if you believe in tooth fairy and Santa Claus and the whole court will laugh. 2. It's their prerogative to alter the flavour of their product, and it was you who bought it even after clearing saying through their label that it was a changed flavour. Your fault, not theirs. 3. Then lastly their lawyers will ask you if you have ever heard the term inflation?? That things go expensive with passage of time and so to keep the price of the product same they reduce the amount of chips in each product. Case closed, you can be fined with wasting the time of company and its lawyers. PS- am a supreme court advocate. Hard to swallow pills ;) Bhai chutiyapa ke disha me badh rhe ho, smbhal ke. But really, is \"being an avid lays customer\" really something to be for an adult? I thought it's only kids who are like that... easily fooled by colorful packaging and 5 seconds of sensation on the tongue... Damn you know Balaji? That's kinda cooool. This is what is called first world problems! You will be surprised to know that Lays in itself is a scam .90 percent air and 10% chips. Atleast it tastes good. > Magic lays was a comfort food and this is causing a lot of issues to my mental health Does anyone have a pin to prick this bubble? Source ? You cant technically sue over this. Use that money for a therapist instead Source? Most likely Pepsi‚Äôs bribing government officials to take too much water from places where it‚Äôs scarce. They do this in the US too here‚Äôs an Indian one, old but they never stopped. i think u have contracted COVID (again?) Ok I did some research and apparently when abused on Instagram pages on why they changed the taste laysindia is replying that the magic masala is coming back they used your favourite and not old so I don't even know what to expect lol NOT A LAWYER! Unless you have proper evidences and no-loophole statements presented, you will either be fined for wasting court time or they may sue you back. If you have a good case, 1. They'll try to sort this outside the court by buying you to shut your mouth 2. Pressure you by indirect \"blackmail\" (if the company is a dark on the inside works 3. If you still make it out of all that stress and court dates, you'll win compensation depending on the infringement and they'll just change the branding a bit and keep selling the same thing. I remember back when lays had Dhoni as its brand ambassador that the dark blue flavour was launched. They stopped producing it years ago if I'm not wrong. Apart from mental health you should also take care of your physical health and avoid LAYS kind of junk food altogether. :) Sue them for what exactly? No reasonable person would expect there to be actual magic in the chips. And Lay's decided to change their recipe, it's their right, you can't do anything about it. They can make whatever recipes they want, as long as they follow the health & safety guidelines, it's their choice. They wanted to change their flavor, they did. There's no case or claim here. The only thing you can do is not buy their products. And that's pretty much it. I mean, what you are basically saying is that you wanna sue them because you don't like the taste of their, which, btw, is extremely subjective. A frivolous lawsuit like this wouldn't do shit even in a country like US where filings lawsuits & suing companies is a lot easier, let alone in India. P. S. - NAL All this ranting about Magic Masala reminds me about Masala Jazz from Kaala Paani but I agree with you OP You want to get paid I only like green lays so can someone explain what the issue is here? Sue them for what exactly? Think of this as a chance to get out of your lays addiction. mail me kya likhu ye batao , hamper to mai bhi leke rahunga Green one is my favourite Just a coincidence, that varun beverages limited, the master franchisee of pepsico in India is 4.82% in a single session today ü§£ chile lemon be gud > iodine (not the healthy kind from spinach ?? aise toh bhai you can use every other company in India, like Kissan, Hindustan Unilever Limited, many more Let's go They are not that bad. Its like a mix of lighter blue lays and a bit of chilli lemon from green. Although i understand why some would absolutely hate it, my mrs also hates the new one. I hope both can co-exist Blue and Cream and Onion lays fav This is the best advice. If you are mentally disturbed because of chips, then there are some other underlying issues here. We're first world, my man Yeah why aren't Indian talking about this! I ate this and had to confirm thrice that I wasn't Balaji. Kyu kyu kyu Unpopular Opinion: Yellow >>> Orange >>> Green >>> Blue Lays Bruh, you eat it in enough quantities it starts tasting like VIM liquid, not that I've ever tasted VIM but I somehow always get that feeling. Still tasty though, if I look past it. Damn , influencers are really good at influencing public opinion (writes down possible business promotion strategy) The only magic is the air in the packets that makes you feel that nothing is inside Lol. Imagine being so stress free that some company changing its chips flavour causes you emotional distress. In the words of Chelsea Peretti, \"Men used to go to wars\". i feel like that if i buy a bigger than 20 pack but the 20 one wont give that affect haa pls btao na (asking for a frnd) happy cake day bud! Haha ask ChatGPT.. That's what I did. Ask your best frAInd ChatGPT. He helped me too. Sure, tell me what they replied. thanks man üçª I calculated an estimate just out of curiosity. It'll cost about 90 CAD through Canada Post lol. The very basic difference lies in the smell of the farts after eating both. More of Zero is still Zero. Saved you time, money and embarrasment. Still the reason for any of that is not \"processed industrial garbage\". Eating junk for a month is no different to eating sweets and desserts daily and expect that you stay healthy, you'd still get the same health issues, you need a balanced diet with reduced carbs intake. I know this coz I ate junk for more than a month, without any balance and had to visit a doctor, now I still eat junk without any adverse effects because I maintain a balanced diet. I hope you are smart enough to understand that junk food is inherently not the problem but it's the people who are unable to control eating junk food and have a balanced diet."
