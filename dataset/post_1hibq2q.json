    "selftext": "The Court observed that more often than not, provisions like Section 498A (cruelty), \n376(rape), \n377(unnatural sex), and \n506(criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code are invoked as a *\"combined package\"* to pressurise the husband to accede to the demands of the wife in matrimonial cases.\n\n\n> *\"The provisions in the criminal law are for the protection and empowerment of women but sometimes are used by certain women more for purposes that they are never meant for. In recent times, the invocation of Sections 498A, 376, 377, 506 of the IPC as a combined package in most of the complaints related to matrimonial disputes is a practice which has been condemned by this Court on several occasions.\"*\n\n*\"In certain cases, the wife and her family tend to use a criminal complaint with all the above serious offences as a platform for negotiation and as a mechanism and a tool to get the husband and his family to comply with their demands, which are mostly monetary in nature,\"*\n-the Court added. Sometimes this is done in a fit of rage, while at times, it is a \"planned strategy.\"",

        "Women need to realize that marriage is not a profession. \nYou become a housewife, work like a maid in husband's house. You don't get paid, unlike a professional job where you can get paid. \nHe can abuse you. The so-called laws that you can use like 498a will now onwards become extremely difficult to use so your husband can torture and abuse you, cheat on you and he will still refuse to pay you alimony or give you any rights on residential property (empowered by the likes of Deepika bhardwaj). \nSo women need to get serious about career. Do not be a housewife. If you like cooking, become a home chef , don't work like a free maid for the in-laws.\nBuy your own fucking house. \nAnd don't get swayed by the media frenzy around ma ki mamta. If you birth a child, remember that men's right movement will ensure that only father has right on child. No child support will be given. Your job will be that of surrogate and financier for your child, nothing else.",
