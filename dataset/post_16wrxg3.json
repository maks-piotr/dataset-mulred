Is there no thought to how this might affect the security of India, with using philosophy and tactics developed for the people of the past to be used by a modern military? It might have some merit if it was thaught to politicians or administrators, since Arthashastra is mainly a treatise on statecraft, but it is being rubbed on the Army.",

        "can't wait for the mighty 'GADHA' to make a comeback",
        "Even ignoring the fact that we use different weapons, the ancient war strategies are going to be useless. Having your soldiers stand in formations is cool and all, except when they can easily be penetrated by a tank or blown up by planes or even cheaper drones. And ancient weapons are far inferior to modern ones so no need to even talk of them",
        "We are gradually becoming like Pakistan. Until 80s, Pakistan was relatively prosperous than India for at least a couple of decades after partition.\n\nZia Ul Haq unleashed religious extremists under his dictatorship the results of which started becoming visible in Pakistan after he was dead. 4 decades later you can see how Pakistan is nearing a collapse and sadly, the same fate awaits India.",
