        "I have been playing the Dark Souls series again. I am currently in the [3rd game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/DARK_SOULS_III/) and it seems to me that it's the easiest one in the series. I had played these games before, but not as a trilogy. Also, the story makes a lot of sense now. I didn't even realise there was an actual story the first time I played it. It's tough, but fair. That hit that one-shot you, yeah, it's not sudden. The bosses have tells and predictable movements. It forces you to not just smash the attack and block buttons, but also look at what the enemy is doing. Even the grunts can get you. I understand now, why beating the DS series gives a \"gamer\" bragging rights.\n\nOn mobile, I have been playing [Stardew Valley](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chucklefish.stardewvalley). I owned this for a long time but never quite got around to it. Each NPC has a unique storyline and the farming, mining, fishing mechanics are fun enough to make you keep coming back. The thing that bothers me is the game doesn't tell you much in the first 2-3 hours of your gameplay. I didn't realise there's a mine, or a bath that can be used to refill your energy until a few hours into the game. There's so much to do that it may be overwhelming in the beginning but as you get the hang of its fun characters and the gameplay, you will keep coming back. A day in the game is around 15 minutes real time and it's perfect for playing in short bursts or at a time, whichever you prefer.",
        "Returned to Forza Horizon 4 after a 6 months hiatus and I am having a blast again. The best racing game I've played. Can't wait for FH5.",
        "Playing ds3 myself too. I found it much easier than the first one. I haven't completed the second game because I hate the yellow filter it has",
        "Addicted to Divinity Original Sin 2. Love the lore, the gameplay, and the fact that I can have character interactions even vaguely reminiscent of the Mass Effect series is a massive plus\n\nFinished Ghostrunner before, truly an exhilarating experience from start to finish\n\nPrior to see I also finished [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://ramblings-of-a-stargazer.netlify.app/post/2021-06-24-an-ode-to-horizon-zero-dawn/) which was spectacular! Wrote about it in the link, if you're into that check it out!",
        "I finished ds3 second run, has high replay value. I think from perfected the game in ds3. Next looking at Sekiro, or if I can get my hands on PS5, DemonSouls",
        "I think they toned it down a lot in the Scholar of the First Sin version of thr 2nd game. Also, I think the rolling mechanics have been made simpler in the 3rd game, hence, making it easier for us to play. Or maybe we have become desensitized from all the deaths.",
        "Oh man, please play Sekiro. The combat doesn't involve many weapons, therform, Fromsoft has perfected it. It's my favourite FromSoft game. Hope you are lucky enough to get a PS5 and do tell us how you find Demon Souls.",
        "Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition\n\nAlso waiting for aoe4",
        "DOS2 is one of the best games I've ever played. It took a while to get in and I gave up once but it is so worth it and this is coming from someone who wasn't into turn based games.",
