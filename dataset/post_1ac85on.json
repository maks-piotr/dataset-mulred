    "selftext": "\n\nOn the 16th of January, a routine train journey turned into a nightmare for a 55-year-old man and his family as they traveled from Gujarat to Delhi. The fateful moment unfolded at Daya Basti railway station when the train unexpectedly made an unscheduled stop. Seizing the opportunity to disembark, the man approached the train door with his family and belongings, unaware of the impending danger lurking nearby.\n\nAmidst the chaos of the unscheduled stop, a group of snatchers targeted the man, attempting to wrestle away his bag. In the struggle that ensued, the man lost his balance and tragically fell onto the tracks, where the unforgiving wheels of the train severed both his legs. Shockingly, instead of rushing to his aid, bystanders chose to document the horrific scene on their smartphones, prioritizing sensationalism over compassion.\n\nAdding to the distressing ordeal, the authorities entrusted with ensuring public safety, including the CRPF and local police, failed to intervene effectively. Despite the desperate pleas of the man's son, Kamal, for assistance, help was nowhere to be found. Even the basic request for a stretcher was met with callous indifference from railway workers, who callously cited bureaucratic regulations, claiming the stretcher could not leave the confines of the station.\n\nLeft with no other recourse, Kamal turned to his landlord for help, illustrating the heartbreaking reality of a system that failed to respond promptly in a moment of crisis. Eventually, through sheer determination and the assistance of compassionate individuals, the injured man was transported to a nearby hospital before being referred to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Karol Bagh, New Delhi, for urgent medical attention.\n\nThis harrowing incident serves as a stark reminder of the dire consequences of negligence and apathy within our public institutions. The failure of bystanders to offer assistance in a time of need, coupled with the inadequate response from authorities, highlights systemic flaws that must be addressed urgently. Every individual deserves the assurance of safety and support, especially during moments of vulnerability.\n\nAs the community grapples with the aftermath of this tragedy, it is imperative that accountability is upheld, and measures are implemented to prevent such incidents from recurring. Let this serve as a rallying cry for justice, empathy, and solidarity in the face of adversity. Together, we must strive to create a society where compassion triumphs over indifference and where every life is valued and protected. #JusticeForVictim #Negligence #RailwaySafety #HelpInNeed #CommunitySupport",
