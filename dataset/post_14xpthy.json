Only in the fine print on the toothpaste it will actually say that you only require a pea-size amount. People do what they see, and end up covering the whole brush in the paste.

MSG is used in lots of food throughout the globe and traces of lead were theorized to be plant buildup and within the limitations ( the wheat used in making those samples was most probably grown in a fertilizer-contaminated land).\n\nLabs at Jaipur, Hyderabad and Punjab also found it to be safe. However, Nestle recalled and destroyed some 300 crores worth of Maggie at that time. \nFurther research has been done and Maggie is totally safe for consumption \n\nI too like and eat a lot of Maggie and instant noodles",

Wait, when did Dettol claim that liquid hand washes are better than bar soaps? Can you share any ad that claimed this? Yea Dettol ads increasingly feature liquid soaps since they're more profitable, I don't recall them comparing the two formats. Even if it kills me, I’m gonna slurp every last noodle of maggi in my bowl Just that, washing hands for merely 10 seconds won't eliminate certain germs, especially virus What about facewash ? Liquid hand wash is better if you have more than one individual using it. Because with soap, it’s kinda unsanitary for multiple people to use the same soap. Does it include salt? True. This is what I use, more people should try it! I dont even fucking care. I user whatever is cheap. Viruses aren't germs tho????? Nice lol Wasn't the maggi ban done so that brands like Patanjali could increase their sales? I use handwash because I don't want to use a soggy piece of soap someone used right after they took a shit. I use soaps for bathing. Bodywash are unnecessarily expensive and also creates extra plastic waste > Remember Lifebuoy handwash's infamous ads, wash your hands within 10 seconds with their hand wash and get 99.99% germ protection. Then Covid told us how well it worked. Poor Bunty did not deserve to be teased by that annoying kid who called his saboon \"slow\"! Because of that, other companies have also copied it. I've seen Lifebuoy and Dettol also. That's what jio did, make a market trend and everyone follows Dude, SLS isn’t a carcinogen, get your facts right before you write panicking misinformation. You may have some sensitivity or allergy to SLS sometimes it happens, use a SLS free toothpaste, sensodyne repair and protect doesn’t have SLS ( not promoting any brand ). Have a look at the list of ingredients before buying toothpaste. Agreed that it’s a marketing strategy and all I am not denying that. It's hardwater which requires extra rinsing I know someone working in food industry, in case of maggie it was nestle refusing to pray bribes and ramdev launcing his brand noodles due to which maghi got badnaam Foaming soaps actually dry your skin out more. Handwashes are fine, but I make sure to always choose facewashes and shower gels that don't foam up too much. COVID is a respiratory virus. It wasn't spread from contact. Aye bunty! Tera sabun slow hai kya? Shit, you're right. I've just been listening to my pharmacist friend. Who knew she's full of shit, yeah? Suggest some good handwash Not only the type of water but liquid soaps like dettol and lifebuoy remove the natural oils our body creates which is can be damage skin over time. Some soaps have moisturizers in them to avoid this. Example is Palmolive liquid soap which is also costlier compared to something like dettol or lifebuoy. You are right, I could have written better but that doesn't degrade the fact that one has to properly keep the soap lather for around 20 seconds to eliminate all the active viruses Also, a significant amount of infections were caused due to contact of the virus with the glands through hands or contaminated items or food All in all, we should wash our hands for at least 20 seconds I may be wrong about the Maggie issue too. MSG is used in lots of food throughout the globe and traces of lead were theorized to be plant buildup and within the limitations ( the wheat used in making those samples was most probably grown in a fertilizer-contaminated land). Labs at Jaipur, Hyderabad and Punjab also found it to be safe. However, Nestle recalled and destroyed some 300 crores worth of Maggie at that time. Further research has been done and Maggie is totally safe for consumption I too like and eat a lot of Maggie and instant noodles These are old tactics. Tell some new ones. Wow an acceptance on the internet. You made my day dude. Its 1/2 or below. haha have a nice one Change your handwash . I switched from Dettol to fiama and it's magic . Will try. I don't agree. I grew up using soaps and switched to liquid soap and few years ago. Liquid one is easy to use, doesn't require to be cleaned and thus can be uaes by multiple people in the house and it lasts way longer. Soap bars are pretty messy and also should not be shared generally. I totally agree with your all points but what I have observe is liquid soap comes with \"convenience\" factor when cleaning of hand comes to where as soap bars are labelled with many myths by marketing and unknown people that's why common people buy these products IMO. I try to clean the nozzle once a week. VWash is not even required I use same logic but less water for shampoo , body wash too. Just a small concern. When you use terms like cdc or fda, specify that these are US agencies and don't treat them as the law over the whole world. It's not \"the\" cdc. All countries have their own cdc. But bro , if u use indian toilet and use ur hands to (y know) and then use the soap to wash ur hands and others are also doing the same w that same soap , dont you think that would be more unhygienic (and disgusting) . Even if liquid handwash is slightly less effective we can just wash our hands twice to clean them. Exactly Says the guy who said he won't use soap because it is dirty"
