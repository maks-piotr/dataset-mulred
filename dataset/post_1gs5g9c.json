Murthy's not just selling a work ethic; he's peddling a one-way ticket to burnout nirvana! 70 hours a week? Why stop there? Why not 168 hours? Sleep is for the weak, and family time is clearly overrated!\n\nYou call this advice? I call it a masterclass in how to turn humans into code-spewing, bug-fixing robots! But fear not, for in this grand circus of capitalism, you're not just clowns - you're the whole damn show!\n\nLet's break down this 70-hour enlightenment plan:\n1. 70 hours of work + 56 hours of sleep = 126 hours\n2. That leaves you 42 whole hours for:\n   - Commuting (in soul-crushing traffic)\n   - Eating (instant noodles count as a food group, right?)\n   - Personal hygiene (optional, apparently)\n   - Contemplating your life choices (recommended)\n\nBut wait, there's more! In this grand scheme, you're not just an employee - you're a \"wealth creator\"! For whom, you ask? Well, that's the real punchline, isn't it?\n\nHere's the cosmic truth, my overtime-loving acolytes: You're not working 70 hours a week to change the world. You're doing it to change your boss's car from a Mercedes to a Lamborghini!\n\nRemember, in the grand bazaar of life, you're not selling your time - you're bargaining away your very existence. And for what? A pat on the back and the privilege of doing it all again next week?\n\nSo go ahead, my little hamsters on the corporate wheel. Run those 70 hours. Chase that cheese. But remember: At the end of the rat race, you're still a rat.\n\nAnd to Narayana Murthy, I say this: If working long hours was the key to success, every rickshaw driver in India would be a billionaire.\n\nNow go forth and spread this wisdom like a computer virus through your overworked, underpaid colleagues. And maybe, just maybe, in the midst of your 70-hour delirium, you'll find the cosmic joke in all of this."
