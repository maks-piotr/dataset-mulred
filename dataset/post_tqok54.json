        "Suggest indie games for 30 year old unkill, folks, and the game should be able to run on amd ryzen on board graphic card üôÅ",
        "Factorio, amazing game, I can just put in hours and hours in it. Don't let the pixelated screenshots fool you into dropping it.",
        "Limbo, Inside, Bastion, Gris, Transistor, The Swapper... check this out. Most of these aren't demanding on graphics and super fun to play.",
        "I love pixelated games and I have 300+ hours in stardew valley. Thanks for the suggestion mate.",
        "Thanks for suggesting. Limbo was really good. I would look into the other games suggested.",
        "Just played some Call of duty Mobile BR; returned to it after a month long break, so much fun dude\n\nI just want Warzone mobile to release already, I'm so hyped",
        "I cannot recommend Hades enough. Amazing band-drawn graphics, tight gameplay, and a story that‚Äôs to die for (you‚Äôll know when you play it). Supergiant‚Äôs best work after Transistor",
        "Thanks, with two recommendations, can't wait to try out this game this weekend",
        "Slay the Spire can run on a potato, it has high replayability some people I know already sink in 1000 hours for that game",
        "Hello everyone!\n\nI am learning game development using Unreal Engine 5. As of now I can make endless runners for android. \n\nWhat desi twist do you want as an Indian audience that I should work on as my first project?",
        "I lost interest after few deaths as it basically felt like repeating everything. Was I wrong to quit early?",
        "I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good game to stick with, especially once you unlock the different weapons that change the gameplay. And with every run, you get stronger, and soon you‚Äôre beating bosses for fun while inching your way towards esacpe. The story that unfolds on the way is a lot of fun too - the real work of art is how a game that‚Äôs an endless loop of death builds such an amazing narrative",
        "Thank you. I will give it another go then :)"
