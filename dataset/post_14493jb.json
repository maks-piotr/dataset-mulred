In these two weeks, we’ve raised INR 28,650. We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who has donated so far and we’re confident that with more time, we’ll be closer to meeting our goal— so, we’re extending the fundraiser till 16 June, 2023!Yesterday, IFF [provided legal assistance](https://internetfreedom.in/it-rules-2023-aim-bombayhc/) to the Association of Indian Magazines in their challenge to the IT Amendment Rules, 2023, which create a government-appointed fact-check unit that can censor online content.\n\n# Fundraiser: r/india for Internet Freedom [https://internetfreedom.in/r-india-for-iff/](https://internetfreedom.in/r-india-for-iff/)\n\nLast week, we [ran a campaign](https://internetfreedom.in/meta-agm-proposal-7-voting-outcome/) with Ekō and India Civil Watch International to encourage Meta shareholders ahead of Meta’s Annual General Meeting to vote yes on Proposal 7, a shareholder proposal that deals with allegations of bias in Meta’s India operations.\n\nLast month, we [assisted](https://internetfreedom.in/in-kunal-kamras-petition-in-the-bombay-high-court-the-government-undertakes-not-to-notify-its-fact-check-unit/) political commentator and satirist, Kunal Kamra in filing a challenge to the  IT Amendment Rules, 2023 before the Bombay High Court . As a result of these proceedings, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology gave an undertaking to the Court that it would not notify the fact-check unit until July 5, 2023. Yesterday, that undertaking was extended until July 20, 2023.\n\nWe work with honesty and courage every day to safeguard and advance your digital rights. But we can’t do our work without your support. IFF relies on donations from individual Indians like you meet 50% of our costs. Last month, we received INR 3,83,629. Our expenses were INR 8,21,692.   \n\n\n[Help us bridge the gap](https://internetfreedom.in/r-india-for-iff/)!  \n",
