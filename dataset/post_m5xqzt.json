        "Playing Fallout 4 these days. It's just not on the same level as New Vegas. For all it's godrays, pretty textures and high poly models, it's a pretty flat story in comparison. No real player agency. In NV, I could do almost anything and the game would not just recognise that choice, but would also mold the gameworld around me accordingly. Fallout 4 doesn't have that same charm. It's graphics over story.",
