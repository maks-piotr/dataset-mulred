    "selftext": "Hello r/India, I recently opened a new Kotak 811 savings accounts and fully completed my KYC. I didn't get my physical debit card but have access to the virtual debit card. I'm also able to transfer money into it from my primary account and even check my balance from the Kotak mobile app.\n\nMy only problem is I cannot link the account to any of the UPI apps Gpay, Phonepe, BHIM, Paytm. All of them refuse saying there's a technical issue and asks me to try again later. Its been a week and I've been trying daily. I enabled my card for online transactions but it just doesn't work.\n\nHere's a screenshot of my trying on Phonepe - [https://i.imgur.com/f9Tmc5Y.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f9Tmc5Y.jpg)\n\nWhat do you think can be the reason? The first two days I thought it might a server issue at their end but I can transfer money through the Kotak iOS app to other contacts and beneficiaries. But UPI seems to be an issue.\n\nAny help will be appreciated. Thank you :)\n\nEdit: grammar",
