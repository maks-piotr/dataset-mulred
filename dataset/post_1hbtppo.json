    "selftext": "We can be sad all we want but letâ€™s be honest : nothingâ€™s going to change. Whom are we kidding to assume that Atulâ€™s case will be a pivotal moment and bring about a change in the Indian lawmakers and judiciaryâ€™s mindset. Even now the judge wasnâ€™t named in the FIR. Kangana (yes sheâ€™s an MP so a law maker) said that in 99 percent of cases men are to blame with so much conviction that you would think that she just didnâ€™t pull that stat from her rear. You can already see women everywhere giving a counter that this case isnâ€™t a gender issue rather a system failing an individual. So we can rant, we can hope and pray for justice but the practical me knows that in a few days we will forget about it and the case would be put on a back burner and the only one still suffering would be Atulâ€™s parents and brother. And that monster of a wife, MIL and lady judge would continue enjoying life as usual. \n\nSometimes I think we should all be a chill guy: drink, play, enjoy the world, be focused on career and donâ€™t marry and just see the relationships getting effâ€™d up with all these nonsensical gender biased laws which have already made people rethink about marriages",

        "Well who will explain it to the ones lording over us and the remnants of the colonial times our my lords. As someone else pointed out these laws have no meaning when it comes to the rich and famous of whatever gender. They will get justice or their own version of justice. And commoners can either not marry or live in fear forever",
        "I hope at least this case can shed some light on the issue .",
        "Agree with the Rick and powerful part. For them itâ€™s either justice as per law or they even have the luxury of their own justice. For this case and more like it, itâ€™s hard not to think from a gender perspective when every male becomes a rapist after a rape case. Now making this a case of justice denied is plain wrong",
