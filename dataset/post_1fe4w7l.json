        "I am not sure who you are but we are just spectators or audience. We don't know what sportspersons in this country are actually going through. Maybe other sportspersons will agree with her. Who are we to judge her?",

        "Sadly, she got to set the stage for her new career. Wouldn't be surprised if she is coached by a special team on this.",
        "Do you know why she was competing in the 50kg category in the first place? When her natural static body weight was never that. Ever.\n\nResearch a bit at least. She’s not wrong.",

Why from such a large contingent of Indian athlete she able to find controversies everyone",

        "WhatsApp group , Bjp Racist , Modi all these are noises, let's remove it. Or maybe this is ur style of conversation ignoring facts and propaganda...\n\n\nFacts: Straight from chargesheet and whatever Vinesh Phogat said.\n\n1. She her self said 1000 of girls , in uncountable number. But as in reality only 3 or 4 girls recorded thr statement,  one who claimed to be minor turned out to be major as per the records. Later on advance stage all girls back tracked from statements \n\n2. V.phogat said she has no conflict of interest...All three were in late 30s , wrestling unlike other sports is dynamic  and favours young blood.  They want relaxation in trial. Period. \n\n3. V Phogat said why camps in lucknow...coach and physio supply girls. As if it's a 80's movie script. Use ur brain , they are wrestlers . Real reason in Rai sonipat Haryana wrestlers do cheating  period. Read about case of Narsing Pamcham. You cannot process the element of caste , Haryana poiyics and jaat chauvinism in it. \n\n4. V Phogat check what he did in Brazil and paris.. \n\nShe will be a great politician, she got all trait. I have zero respect for her. She used wrestling , she used senestive topic of sexual harrasment and character assassination of woman wtestlers,  she malign the pious relation coach and players,  she even refused the invitation from Prez for feliciation during republic day. \n\n\nReddit is not the source , go and read the original text.",
        "During the trials. \n\nYou need to look at Haryana politics and affairs.  \nTwo wrestlers from Hisar. One is Antim and v. Kaliraman n challanges Bajrang Punia.

Plus she herself has been disqualified for the exact same reason before in 2016. \n\nAnd neither is she the only wrestler to be disqualified. 4 other wrestlers got disqualified for the exact same reason.\n\nAlso do we ever know of anyone who's disqualification was cancelled ?\n\nIf not, let's give conspiracy theory a rest. That's all I want to say.",
        "So,  a young upcoming athlete like antim who won a medal in her first world championship,  and got the quota herself , shouldn't get the quota. Antim got quota for that category because she deserved it. And weight change is not something unique,  many wrestlers around the world do that. Dhaiya,  the tokyo  olympic silver medalist who couldn't get the quota for this olympics because of injury , is also changing hisvweight catogary,  it is considered by many that i us because that catogary in which he fights is getting really competitive,  with aman sherawat who won bronze in this olymipcs being the leader in it.",
        "A lot of others are asking her to stop these blame games etc. She is now a politician. Indian politicians survive based on blame games, me vs world, victim cards etc. \n\n\nIt was her mistake that she got disqualified. But if the same gets projected it is bad PR for her. Instead of that if she tries to pin the reason for defeat on Brij Bhushan and hence on BJP, it would definitely give her an advantage.",
        "She was competing in the 50 kg category bc India already had a representative in the 53 kg one. Antim gave us the berth by competing in the WWC, hence deserved to go to the Olympics on it.\n\nShe chose to go into 50 bc she has previously competed at 48 kg too - which was her first Olympics. She thought she’d be able to manage the weight difference - and props to her, she almost did.\n\nShe’s had a good campaign, no one’s complaining about the lack of a medal - most of us only discuss her bravado. But the fact is that she was DQed, and the IOC (plus Usha) she’s shitting on rn tried to appeal and get things in her favour. Not everything is a conspiracy.",
        "I don’t really get this comment. If you’re trying to talk about her using her Olympics campaign to bolster her political career - that’s not really wrong, it’s how politics works in a system that’s the equivalent of a popularity contest.\n\nI’m just tired of the self-victimization. Not being able to compete in WWC due to injury was unfortunate, as was not being able to make weight at the Olympics, but neither one of those was anyone’s fault.",
        "> V phoogat able to qualify, coz she was allowed to particitin two weight category, which was undue favour.\n\n\n>During the trials.\n\n\nThis is what rewriting history looks like. \n\n\n\nAntim didn't get the 53kg spot for winning in those trials. She got it because she won a medal that qualified India for the 53kg category, and the trials that were supposed to select the Olympic entry were cancelled.  Her not having to go through the Olympic entry trials as the undue favour. Vinesh hedged against that exact possibility by competing in 50kg tryouts as well, since the 53kg tryouts topper want to get the spot, but there was a chance of cancellation of the plans of top 4 of 53kg tryouts competing for the position. \n\n\nHere's the actual timeline:\n\n\nhttps://sportstar.thehindu.com/olympics/paris-2024/news/vinesh-phogat-antim-panghal-53kg-paris-2024-olympics-selection-trial-explain-wfi-timeline-ioa-ad-hoc-committee/article68500511.ece\n\n\n\nMarch 7, 2024: The Delhi High Court – acting on a plea by some prominent wrestlers including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh and Sakshi Malik – rules on March 7 that the IOA-appointed ad-hoc committee would conduct the trials. The ad-hoc committee had fixed the dates for selection trials for the Asian Championships and Asian Olympic Games qualifier in Bishkek for March 10 and 11 in Sonepat (men) and Patiala (women). Earlier, after the WFI’s suspension was lifted by UWW on February 13, the national body had also announced the same dates for trials in Delhi.\n\nMarch 8, 2024: UWW makes it clear that it would receive entries only from its affiliated national body, the Wrestling Federation of India and not the IOA-appointed ad-hoc committee.\n\nMarch 9, 2024: After UWW’s communication, the ad-hoc committee – which had earlier decided to consider only the wrestlers who had competed in the National Championships conducted by it in Jaipur apart from some wrestlers who performed well in 2022 and 2023 for the trials – and the WFI prepare a combined list for the trials, and included participants from the WFI-organised Pune Nationals, earlier not recognised by the Government.\n\nThe ad-hoc committee, based on the WFI’s amended 2022 Selection Policy, decides that the top four wrestlers in every class would compete among themselves on June 10 in order to determine a challenger for the Olympic-quota winners to pick the final Olympic squad.\n\nMarch 11, 2024: Vinesh, expressing doubts about WFI’s commitment to hold a selection trial on a later day, insisted on participating in two weight categories -- 50 and 53kg. The ad-hoc committee, making an exception, allowed Vinesh to compete in both categories upon the later’s insistence.\n\nShe won the trials in 50kg, earning the right to compete at the Asian Olympic qualifiers in Bishkek. She needed to reach the semifinals of the women’s 53kg category to feature in the top four to challenge Antim at a later date. Vinesh offered no defence in her 10-0 loss to Anju in the semifinals since her purpose of competing at the trials was already accomplished.\n\nMarch 18, 2024: IOA dissolves the ad-hoc committee, saying “there is no further need” for it to continue after revocation of the suspension on the national federation by UWW.\n\nApril 20, 2024: Vinesh wins quota in 50kg for Paris 2024 during the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Bishkek.\n\nApril 24, 2024: “After the Istanbul event (World Olympic Games Qualifiers), we will decide whether to conduct trials for the Olympics. The selection committee will decide that. The selection rule says we should have trials. Hope trials will be conducted before sending the team,” WFI President Sanjay Singh tells Sportstar on the sidelines of the Federation Cup in Varanasi.\n\nMay 15, 2024: “By the time trials are finished, the Olympics will be almost there, so when do we start preparations? In my opinion, trials should not be held,” Aman Sehrawat, the quota-winner in men’s 57kg, tells PTI when asked about the trials to decide the final squad for Olympics.\n\nMay 15, 2024: Vinesh criticises WFI for not not providing information about the final selection trials format, “including the date, time and venue” with three months left for the Paris Olympics.\n\nMay 17, 2024: “We need mental peace before the Olympics. Already two months is too less a period to prepare. At this stage, every single day counts. We plan our training on a weekly basis and if I am called to India for trials, it will disrupt plans and affect medal chances,” Anshu Malik, the quota-winner in women’s 57kg, tells PTI while training in Tokyo.\n\nMay 17, 2024: “I am still recovering from the weight-cut at the qualifiers. If we undergo trials again, it will affect our body. We have to complete with elite wrestlers and need to plan well. But if keep thinking about trials, how will we strategise,” Nisha Dahiya, the quota-winner in women’s 68kg, tells PTI.\n\nMay 17, 2024: “It takes us about seven days to reduce weight and almost a similar time to recover after competition. If I have to again start the procedure, it’s a huge challenge. We should not be subjected to the trials,”  Reetika Hooda, the quota-winner in women’s 76kg category, tells PTI.\n\nMay 21, 2024: The seven-member WFI selection committee unanimously decides not to hold trials, therefore allowing the quota-winners to compete in the Paris Olympics.\n\n“Five wrestlers (except Vinesh) had written to the WFI requesting exemption from trials. The selection committee decided not to conduct the trials and send the quota winners to Paris,” WFI president Sanjay Singh tells PTI.",
        "I thought she lost to the other lady, Antim in 53kg earlier during the trial phase so she went to 50kg which was way lower than here average weight of 57 kg.",
        "Now as the person has joined politics. This was bound to happen. This is the cost of getting into politics.

Congress has instructed her to use the incident to get maximum brownie points and to rile up people against BJP.

        "I mean in Indian wrestling same many times there aren't tryouts to select the wrestlers for events. The quota winners (which was Antim Panghal) are directly selected for the events. Even Vinesh Phogat was selected once like that",
        "She's a politician now, dgf whatever she says now. Joined the elite list of mfs, saare ek jaise hain bc",
        "Vinesh didn't choose her category. Her preferred category was 53KGs and they cancelled tryouts for it.\n\nAlso (I could be wrong on this one) her preferred Dr, physio trainer weren't taken along.",
        "She lost to antim Panghal in 53 kg during tryouts, but still badly wanted to complete so she decided to go one more step down\n\nAnd yes she had her own dr physio trainer, this was mentioned on the floor of the house (I guess in lok sabha) and she never denied it",
        "> She lost to antim Panghal in 53 kg during tryouts\n\nNo she didn't . The top 4 playoffs simply weren't held.\n\n\nhttps://x.com/prempanicker/status/1822307692536328592",

When there's clear evidence that they forced her to choose between not participating or participating in the 50kg category by gossip m first promising and then cancelling tryouts in 53kg category? Why would you call the misfortune? I am not sure who you are but we are just spectators or audience. We don't know what sportspersons in this country are actually going through. Maybe other sportspersons will agree with her. Who are we to judge her? On a side note, PT Usha late coach O M Nambiar was a child molester. Rtfa.

You competed, had all of our support, could not make weight and got DQed, and still had our respect. Don’t overdo it. It was her misfortune that she was born in India and thought the PM of this country will side with our athletes and not their rapist/molester. Sadly, she got to set the stage for her new career. Wouldn't be surprised if she is coached by a special team on this. Do you know why she was competing in the 50kg category in the first place? When her natural static body weight was never that. Ever. Research a bit at least. She’s not wrong. \"Listen. We expressed our pity. Now shut up and sit down. Don't try to make a change in the system that fucked you up.\" Thanks for doing her a favour with your sympathy, when you seem to blame her for the DQ. Sorry that she bothered you again after her annoying protests last year. Well now she is being Kangana Your sentences start with \" When thr is clear evidence \". No such evidence nothing. She chose this category coz she wants an extension and refused to fight Antim Panghal. Vinesh Phogat is a very bad and twisted human being, she is not a victim but the opposite. .. Research what happened with her in Tokyo and Brazil olympics. Why did she change the weight category. Why from such a large contingent of Indian athlete she able to find controversies everyone By that logic everyone is a rapist . As anyone can accuse anyone of rape. This is a unique case where not even a single victim came fwd, but 3 wrestlers who has conflict of interest from relaxation in trail to presedential posts in WFI. Why was she competing in the 50kg? Cause she wanst qualified for 52 is what I heard. If there is some other news post it. What's ur research on it? She is not wrong , but she is very twisted and bad human being , be glad that she is not in ur life Cause rahul is even bad 😌 A country where accountability or responsibility have no role and blaming is star this acts will be normal. My guy more than one victim came forward. If Modi had not gone out of his way to protect his rapey ass, even the case of abuse of a minor would have come forward. But even now he's been charged by the Delhi police. I know you can't go to bed without protecting some or the other BJP racist but at least check the real facts and not what they told you on your pro rape WhatsApp group. >refused to fight Antim Panghal. When? Then I would ask who is she saying that for... If you say something it'll be praised and judged both. It's applicable to every statment especially made by a \"public\" figure WhatsApp group , Bjp Racist , Modi all these are noises, let's remove it. Or maybe this is ur style of conversation ignoring facts and propaganda... Facts: Straight from chargesheet and whatever Vinesh Phogat said. 1. She her self said 1000 of girls , in uncountable number. But as in reality only 3 or 4 girls recorded thr statement, one who claimed to be minor turned out to be major as per the records. Later on advance stage all girls back tracked from statements 2. V.phogat said she has no conflict of interest...All three were in late 30s , wrestling unlike other sports is dynamic and favours young blood. They want relaxation in trial. Period. 3. V Phogat said why camps in lucknow...coach and physio supply girls. As if it's a 80's movie script. Use ur brain , they are wrestlers . Real reason in Rai sonipat Haryana wrestlers do cheating period. Read about case of Narsing Pamcham. You cannot process the element of caste , Haryana poiyics and jaat chauvinism in it. 4. V Phogat check what he did in Brazil and paris.. She will be a great politician, she got all trait. I have zero respect for her. She used wrestling , she used senestive topic of sexual harrasment and character assassination of woman wtestlers, she malign the pious relation coach and players, she even refused the invitation from Prez for feliciation during republic day. Reddit is not the source , go and read the original text. During the trials. You need to look at Haryana politics and affairs. Two wrestlers from Hisar. One is Antim and v. Kaliraman n challanges Bajrang Punia. Bajrang even failed to qualify. V phoogat able to qualify, coz she was allowed to particitin two weight category, which was undue favour. She is saying this for us to know. She will be a great politician, she got all trait. I have zero respect for her. She used wrestling , she used senestive topic of sexual harrasment and character assassination of woman wtestlers, she malign the pious relation coach and players, she even refused the invitation 1. She chose her category 2. She chose her dr, physio, trainer Where is the scope for conspiracy.? Plus she herself has been disqualified for the exact same reason before in 2016. And neither is she the only wrestler to be disqualified. 4 other wrestlers got disqualified for the exact same reason. Also do we ever know of anyone who's disqualification was cancelled ? If not, let's give conspiracy theory a rest. That's all I want to say. So, a young upcoming athlete like antim who won a medal in her first world championship, and got the quota herself , shouldn't get the quota. Antim got quota for that category because she deserved it. And weight change is not something unique, many wrestlers around the world do that. Dhaiya, the tokyo olympic silver medalist who couldn't get the quota for this olympics because of injury , is also changing hisvweight catogary, it is considered by many that i us because that catogary in which he fights is getting really competitive, with aman sherawat who won bronze in this olymipcs being the leader in it. A lot of others are asking her to stop these blame games etc. She is now a politician. Indian politicians survive based on blame games, me vs world, victim cards etc. It was her mistake that she got disqualified. But if the same gets projected it is bad PR for her. Instead of that if she tries to pin the reason for defeat on Brij Bhushan and hence on BJP, it would definitely give her an advantage. She was competing in the 50 kg category bc India already had a representative in the 53 kg one. Antim gave us the berth by competing in the WWC, hence deserved to go to the Olympics on it. She chose to go into 50 bc she has previously competed at 48 kg too - which was her first Olympics. She thought she’d be able to manage the weight difference - and props to her, she almost did. She’s had a good campaign, no one’s complaining about the lack of a medal - most of us only discuss her bravado. But the fact is that she was DQed, and the IOC (plus Usha) she’s shitting on rn tried to appeal and get things in her favour. Not everything is a conspiracy. I don’t really get this comment. If you’re trying to talk about her using her Olympics campaign to bolster her political career - that’s not really wrong, it’s how politics works in a system that’s the equivalent of a popularity contest. I’m just tired of the self-victimization. Not being able to compete in WWC due to injury was unfortunate, as was not being able to make weight at the Olympics, but neither one of those was anyone’s fault. > V phoogat able to qualify, coz she was allowed to particitin two weight category, which was undue favour. >During the trials. This is what rewriting history looks like. Antim didn't get the 53kg spot for winning in those trials. She got it because she won a medal that qualified India for the 53kg category, and the trials that were supposed to select the Olympic entry were cancelled. Her not having to go through the Olympic entry trials as the undue favour. Vinesh hedged against that exact possibility by competing in 50kg tryouts as well, since the 53kg tryouts topper want to get the spot, but there was a chance of cancellation of the plans of top 4 of 53kg tryouts competing for the position. Here's the actual timeline: March 7, 2024: The Delhi High Court – acting on a plea by some prominent wrestlers including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh and Sakshi Malik – rules on March 7 that the IOA-appointed ad-hoc committee would conduct the trials. The ad-hoc committee had fixed the dates for selection trials for the Asian Championships and Asian Olympic Games qualifier in Bishkek for March 10 and 11 in Sonepat (men) and Patiala (women). Earlier, after the WFI’s suspension was lifted by UWW on February 13, the national body had also announced the same dates for trials in Delhi. March 8, 2024: UWW makes it clear that it would receive entries only from its affiliated national body, the Wrestling Federation of India and not the IOA-appointed ad-hoc committee. March 9, 2024: After UWW’s communication, the ad-hoc committee – which had earlier decided to consider only the wrestlers who had competed in the National Championships conducted by it in Jaipur apart from some wrestlers who performed well in 2022 and 2023 for the trials – and the WFI prepare a combined list for the trials, and included participants from the WFI-organised Pune Nationals, earlier not recognised by the Government. The ad-hoc committee, based on the WFI’s amended 2022 Selection Policy, decides that the top four wrestlers in every class would compete among themselves on June 10 in order to determine a challenger for the Olympic-quota winners to pick the final Olympic squad. March 11, 2024: Vinesh, expressing doubts about WFI’s commitment to hold a selection trial on a later day, insisted on participating in two weight categories -- 50 and 53kg. The ad-hoc committee, making an exception, allowed Vinesh to compete in both categories upon the later’s insistence. She won the trials in 50kg, earning the right to compete at the Asian Olympic qualifiers in Bishkek. She needed to reach the semifinals of the women’s 53kg category to feature in the top four to challenge Antim at a later date. Vinesh offered no defence in her 10-0 loss to Anju in the semifinals since her purpose of competing at the trials was already accomplished. March 18, 2024: IOA dissolves the ad-hoc committee, saying “there is no further need” for it to continue after revocation of the suspension on the national federation by UWW. April 20, 2024: Vinesh wins quota in 50kg for Paris 2024 during the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Bishkek. April 24, 2024: “After the Istanbul event (World Olympic Games Qualifiers), we will decide whether to conduct trials for the Olympics. The selection committee will decide that. The selection rule says we should have trials. Hope trials will be conducted before sending the team,” WFI President Sanjay Singh tells Sportstar on the sidelines of the Federation Cup in Varanasi. May 15, 2024: “By the time trials are finished, the Olympics will be almost there, so when do we start preparations? In my opinion, trials should not be held,” Aman Sehrawat, the quota-winner in men’s 57kg, tells PTI when asked about the trials to decide the final squad for Olympics. May 15, 2024: Vinesh criticises WFI for not not providing information about the final selection trials format, “including the date, time and venue” with three months left for the Paris Olympics. May 17, 2024: “We need mental peace before the Olympics. Already two months is too less a period to prepare. At this stage, every single day counts. We plan our training on a weekly basis and if I am called to India for trials, it will disrupt plans and affect medal chances,” Anshu Malik, the quota-winner in women’s 57kg, tells PTI while training in Tokyo. May 17, 2024: “I am still recovering from the weight-cut at the qualifiers. If we undergo trials again, it will affect our body. We have to complete with elite wrestlers and need to plan well. But if keep thinking about trials, how will we strategise,” Nisha Dahiya, the quota-winner in women’s 68kg, tells PTI. May 17, 2024: “It takes us about seven days to reduce weight and almost a similar time to recover after competition. If I have to again start the procedure, it’s a huge challenge. We should not be subjected to the trials,” Reetika Hooda, the quota-winner in women’s 76kg category, tells PTI. May 21, 2024: The seven-member WFI selection committee unanimously decides not to hold trials, therefore allowing the quota-winners to compete in the Paris Olympics. “Five wrestlers (except Vinesh) had written to the WFI requesting exemption from trials. The selection committee decided not to conduct the trials and send the quota winners to Paris,” WFI president Sanjay Singh tells PTI. I thought she lost to the other lady, Antim in 53kg earlier during the trial phase so she went to 50kg which was way lower than here average weight of 57 kg. Now as the person has joined politics. This was bound to happen. This is the cost of getting into politics. You tow the party line and play along in your respective fields, in line with the general party stand. This is not new, this is an age old phenomenon. Very few exceptions exists.q You thought wrong. She didn’t get a chance to fight Antim for the 53kg slot. > I’m just tired of the self-victimization. Not being able to compete in WWC due to injury was unfortunate, as was not being able to make weight at the Olympics, but neither one of those was anyone’s fault. And the general public doesn't exactly know that. Congress has instructed her to use the incident to get maximum brownie points and to rile up people against BJP. As far as politics is concerned, negativity always has a bigger pull than positivity. She didn't. Please see the timeline with reference I've posted. > They want relaxation in trial. Period. Lol, she defeated the nigh unbeatable Japanese champion and you think she wanted relaxation lol. You’re just another one of BJP’s rapist murderer supporters. I would say shame on you, but being shameless vermin is an immutable characteristic of people like you. I mean in Indian wrestling same many times there aren't tryouts to select the wrestlers for events. The quota winners (which was Antim Panghal) are directly selected for the events. Even Vinesh Phogat was selected once like that She's a politician now, dgf whatever she says now. Joined the elite list of mfs, saare ek jaise hain bc Vinesh didn't choose her category. Her preferred category was 53KGs and they cancelled tryouts for it. Also (I could be wrong on this one) her preferred Dr, physio trainer weren't taken along. She lost to antim Panghal in 53 kg during tryouts, but still badly wanted to complete so she decided to go one more step down And yes she had her own dr physio trainer, this was mentioned on the floor of the house (I guess in lok sabha) and she never denied it > She lost to antim Panghal in 53 kg during tryouts No she didn't . The top 4 playoffs simply weren't held. Lost in terms of Quota. 6 other wrestlers (including antim) had already qualified (including antim in 53 kg) while Vinesh was protesting.
