That comment was made before you shared all the links. Having offices or officials means nothing when genocide is being carried out. Why are you missing the whole point here? The guy claimed Israel did what it did cause of hamas. So, why is it doing the same in West Bank. Let's assume you're right for a min. Hamas has offices and officials. Does that give Israel enough right to bomb and encroach the land on West Bank? No, it doesn't. \n\n>Bro do you think India is disciminating between Lashkar e Taiba accountants and fighters\n\nYeah, but india is differentiating between terrorists and civilians. Israel isn't.

Just like India went after entire PFI and not just the so called terrorists. \n\nWow!! Well done. I thought you were better than most, but you've also started giving excuses for the terrorism done by Israel.\n\nAnswer me this. Why was Israel doing what it's doing now before the inception of Hamas? Since all this mess has been causes by the actions of Hamas.\n\n>Now I am not a Hindutwadi and I don't even support Kashmiri occupation.

Read some history beyond October 7th. \n\nYou don’t even need to go that far behind. Let’s even assume that the 1967 division of two states is something that is acceptable.

About three quarters of Gazans express support for both groups, including 40% who see the Lion’s Den in a “very positive” light, an attitude shared by a similar percentage of West Bank residents. Moreover, when it comes to Iran, which has strongly supported and potentially helped coordinate the attack, about half of Gazans view Tehran as either a “friend of the country” (29%) or security partner (28%), compared to less than a third of West Bankers who would say the same.\n\nWhich means Gazans have support for organisations which are as as extreme if not more than Hamas - PIJ & Lion's Den",

Beheaded children? That was AI generated which fools like Ben Shapiro shared on their social media.\n\nNobody was celebrating the October 7th massacre.\nAnd this isn’t about religion.

They make their millitary infra underground a hospital or within residential buildings. Now what is Israel supposed to do just sit there keep intercepting their cheap missile with expensive iron dome missiles? And not protect their citizens? They send out message signals so that civilians get out in time. Before actually striking the building they strike them with warning shots. What's the other alternative? Hamas main agenda is to execute every jew in the world. \n\n\nAlso let's not deflect from the original point you still haven't showed any proof that there is no Hamas in West Bank.",

        "Totally agreed, few people decides they want more and innocent civilians die.",
        "IMO that's a simplistic and unidimensional view of the conflict. It's not inaccurate, but it's not the complete picture either. I'd advice you to go back further and read about the treatment of Jews by various parties since the medieval times. They were discriminated against in every country they lived in, and muslim-majority countries were no exception. When I say the conflict is thousands of years old, I'm including the history of the Jewish people because I think that history is an important part of today's Israel even if the state didn't exist back then.",

        "I know that. Jews were fucked by a lot of ppl, culminating with holocaust, and i empathize with them having safe land. But that doesnt mean you take some other 3rd world country's land and give it to them. Palestine was a british colony and UN gave that land to the jews. Palestinians nor the neighboring country's  accepted it. They gave the land and shit ton of money and weapons to jews to colonize that country. Hence, thats a colony. \n\nIf they had given part of england with england parliaments permission, thats a whole different story. Palestinians did not agree to this.\n\nOn top of that, UN's idea was that they go there and form democracy with local palestinians getting equal rights. But that was a pipe dream, that would have never happened. No only did they colonize it, they immediately started cleansing it with Nakba, mass displacement of local population. Same way British did after 1857 mutiny. Entire delhi was demolished (we have pictures from before 1857, and from 1860 both from jama masjid, also happened in other major cities) Indian communities weren't the same again, same as palestinian communities. India truly became 3rd world country then.",
        "You're right, which is why I said you can't take sides here in my original comment. We are in the situation we are now because of decisions made in the past. Decisions that we can't undo. Decisions that we have to live with, even if they were wrong.",
        "i think we can have a take. Like, dumping 6000 bombs in 2 days over civilians is war crimes and must be stopped. This is more than any even in WW2. The goal should be only to get the hostages out safe, and destroy hamas. Enter gaza and destroy hamas. Dont carpet bomb the city with 1 million kids in it.\n\nWe can have more takes too, like, Jewish settlements in west bank need to stop immediately. According to many resolutions, that is where Palestinians would find their safe country. Those settlements and armed murdering of palestinians there using international help must be stopped. \n\nWe can definitely have these kinds of takes. Most issues are because of past decisions and missteps. We have to decide what is the right path going forward, given the past.",
        "\"War\". Google the military capability of 1 side and the military capability of the other.",
        "This war is between Israel and Hamas, so if Hamas doesn’t exist anymore isn’t that great?",
        "Not quite. That's just a lie Israel, ie, the occupying force propagated. There were no Hamas before '87. Who were they bombing, displacing and mass murdering before that?\n\nThere are no Hamas in the west bank. Why is the west bank losing area and why do the stats read so many Palestinian deaths there?\n\nEither Palestine is wiped off the map or Israel keeps trying. There is no middle ground.\n\nJust the month before Hamas attack. How many Palestinians were bombed? (Look it up, the number is in hundreds).\n\nIDF terrorists continued to bring in terrorists and displace Palestinians and take over their homes. (These settlers also have tonnes of murder and rape charges on them, none of which have seen court)"

The material includes essential life-saving medicines, surgical items, tents, sleeping bags, tarpaulins, sanitary utilities, water purification tablets among other necessary items. This is a great step by India. In any conflict, it's the ordinary civilian who greatly suffers.",

Is there any indication that the relief meant for ordinary citizens won't be cornered by the terrorists? I completely agree, in any conflict it's the common folks (men, women, children) who get disproportionately affected. If they don’t attack Israel in the first place nothing would have happened It will be definitely taken up by Hamas So, why is Israel committing genocide in West Bank where there is literally zero hamas present? They don’t torture. They target building which hide Hamas operatives. Did you read what I wrote? They attack West Bank, which has zero hamas presence. Lies. All done with your agenda? Congratulations on supporting terrorism! Palestinian president has zero powers. The country is controlled by Hamas and TERRORIST organisation Average braindead reddior I could say the same thing about you. You have no problem with them torturing the innocent but have problem with Israel taking revenge on the Terrorists 90 killed just yesterday in West Bank by IDF and \"settlers\"... It's just a genocide. They’re taking revenge on civilians, not just terrorists. Collective punishment is considered a war crime. If someone from your family commits a crime, and you get punished for it, how would you feel? Think a little He would just shout, \"lies\". The agreement for this aid has 2 conditions: no fuel and Israel oversight over the use of the material for humanitarian use only- so they set the safeguards on the material only being used for help This comment shows there you can never please everyone The HAMAS literally dug and cut the pipes and converted them to rockets which were given by the EU under aid to supply water to the people. They're out of food water and electricity but surprisingly not out of missiles and weapons. The HAMAS leaders children reside in Qatar in lavish villas and running super cars and living exotic lifestyles what would you think the future aid would be going? And your source to claim that? I have read news reports saying Hamas has a presence in the West Bank as well, though not that big. Bombings on the West Bank are not as bad as that on the Strip. West Bank has significant Hamas presence. The ruling party is not conducting elections because they are afraid they will lose to Hamas. Sooo why did they strip people of West Bank, tied them up and piss on them? Regardless, Israel can wipe out the West Bank and Gaza practically overnight if they wanted to. Hamas wants to wipe out Israel and Jews in general, but lacked resources. There's no equivalence between the two I suggest you read history about how it all started. In late 1940s. No, they don't. If you check up any news, you'll find there are zero hamas personnel in West Bank, and due to this, Isreal is arming its settlers there instead of sending armed forces. >conducting elections because they are afraid they will lose to Hamas. That's your personal opinion. Bruh, are you literally celebrating an apartheid nation that commits state sponsored terrorism? How emotionally dead are you guys? With all its advanced machinery and weapons and the western support, Israel couldn't do it in decades. They are cowards. They can try all they want, but Palestinians aren't going anywhere. So, cry me a river. Watch the Piers Morgan and Bassem Youssef interview. Start with that. >Bombings on the West Bank are not as bad as that on the Strip. Yeah, cause West Bank is where the Israeli settlers live. Since there is no armed resistance from Hamas or any other body, settlers take the homes of Palestinians. After the Hamas attack, Israel started arming these settlers. It's not your fault. The disinformation coming out from both sides is so high that you have probably been misled. Anyway assuming it was a genuine error on your part, here's a compilation of articles which show that there's significant presence of Hamas in West Bank and in all probability they will win elections if it's held today. Fatah is almost dead now. >That's your personal opinion. > On top of this, the President of the State of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, postponed elections that were meant to be held in April 2021, a decision criticized by Hamas. It is said that one of the reasons for the delay is that Abbas feared a Hamas win. You joined the party a little too late. If you watch a football match at the 70’ mark, and Real Madrid score a goal and then Juventus score 2 more, would you say Juventus is winning and completely ignore the 5 goals Real Madrid scored in the 1st half? Bro, maybe you didn't get what I said. When I said zero presence, I meant no personnel. Your article shows a support for hamas in West Bank, which may be true, but hamas has no fighters in West Bank since that's where the Israeli settlers take the land and properties of Palestinians. If you check the news, after the hamas attack, Israel has started arming its settlers in West Bank with weapons instead of sending armed forces cause it knows that the only inhabitants of West Bank are civilians. There is no indication that the terrorists will stop dropping bombs on the relief material since their goal is to completely kill all Palestinians and steal their land. >When I said zero presence, I meant no personnel. Your article shows a support for hamas in West Bank, which may be true, but hamas has no fighters in West Bank When you said zero presence, anyone would imagine you meant zero Hamas officials. To answer that Hamas has offices and extensive local presence there. Whether they have fighters or not is something we cannot say. But it's pretty obvious they do. It's impossible for so many Hamas officials to exist in West Bank and not a single fighter. Regardless Israel has vowed to end Hamas and even the non fighting staff are going to get targeted. >When you said zero presence, anyone would imagine you meant zero Hamas officials. >>No, they don't. If you check up any news, you'll find there are **no hamas personnel in West Bank,** and due to this, Isreal is arming its settlers there instead of sending armed forces. This is what I said before in my second reply to you. >Whether they have fighters or not is something we cannot say. But it's pretty obvious they do. It's impossible for so many Hamas officials to exist in West Bank and not a single fighter. Regardless Israel has vowed to end Hamas and even the non fighting staff are going to get targeted. Again, that's just your opinion. From the reports, it's clear there aren't any fighters in West Bank. That's one of the reasons why encroachment is done on such a scale in West Bank by Isreal. Isreal first helped create hamas and propped it up, and now they are paying the price. This stuff has been going on since before the inception of Hamas afterall Israel is an apartheid state executing state sponsored terrorism. >Again, that's just your opinion. From the reports, it's clear there aren't any fighters in West Bank. That's one of the reasons why encroachment is done on such a scale in West Bank by Isreal. That's not my opinion. Israel said they have arrested around 500 - 700 Hamas officials in West Bank. Now obviously whether Israel can be trusted or not is a different point. But your initial assertion that there is no Hamas in West Bank is completely false. Fuck off with the Hamas apologists under the garb of Palestinians. If your heart bled so much for innocent civilians, you would be sharing the same anger when Hamas terrorists killed women and children and burnt them alive. There is only one side which purposely kills civilians. And it's the Islamic terrorists under the guise of freedom. I wonder what was your reaction when Pakistani terrorists carried out the Mumbai massacre? Your heart was still bleeding for Kashmiri freedom fighters? you joined a little late too, said Zoroastrians and Jewish from history who had to flee to India and other parts of the world. btw, Britain was there.. so yk :) >Israel said they have arrested around 500 - 700 Hamas officials in West Bank. Bro, come on now. Come on. You really think I'll believe anything that Isreal says? >But your initial assertion that there is no Hamas in West Bank is completely false. You haven't proved it to be false, though. What is the point of these? We all know that the Palestinians in gaza are terrorists. Why are they wasting taxpayer's money? >You haven't proved it to be false, though I showed you enough evidence of how incredibly popular Hamas is in West Bank and they have registered offices and presence there. You then clarified that you say there are no Hamas fighters in West Bank. I hope we both are in agreement now that hamas officials are present in West Bank and fighters may or may not be present. Bro do you think India is disciminating between Lashkar e Taiba accountants and fighters? Israel is demolishing Hamas and they have a very large presence in West Bank. They are going all in. Just like India went after entire PFI and not just the so called terrorists. Now I am not a Hindutwadi and I don't even support Kashmiri occupation. But to say that Hamas was not present in West Bank is an incredibly weird thing to say. Forgot /s ? >I showed you enough evidence of how incredibly popular Hamas is in West Bank and they have registered offices and presence there. Popularity and personnel is different. >You then clarified that you say there are no Hamas fighters in West Bank. I hope we both are in agreement now that hamas officials are present in West Bank and fighters may or may not be present. I didn't clarify it. You were the one who missed it. That comment was made before you shared all the links. Having offices or officials means nothing when genocide is being carried out. Why are you missing the whole point here? The guy claimed Israel did what it did cause of hamas. So, why is it doing the same in West Bank. Let's assume you're right for a min. Hamas has offices and officials. Does that give Israel enough right to bomb and encroach the land on West Bank? No, it doesn't. >Bro do you think India is disciminating between Lashkar e Taiba accountants and fighters Yeah, but india is differentiating between terrorists and civilians. Israel isn't. Which was my whole point that you've completely missed. >Israel is demolishing Hamas and they have a very large presence in West Bank. No, they don't. >They are going all in. Just like India went after entire PFI and not just the so called terrorists. Wow!! Well done. I thought you were better than most, but you've also started giving excuses for the terrorism done by Israel. Answer me this. Why was Israel doing what it's doing now before the inception of Hamas? Since all this mess has been causes by the actions of Hamas. >Now I am not a Hindutwadi and I don't even support Kashmiri occupation. But to say that Hamas was not present in West Bank is an incredibly weird thing to say. Again, you're just going in circles. You literally tried to use Israeli news in the last comment as a fact. I still stand by my point. People taking sides here - this conflict is literally 1000s of years old, and it probably won’t be solved for the next few generations at least. Neither side is blameless, and nobody can say otherwise. My free advice - stay out of it, like India has. Take humanity’s side. Keep sending aid and condolences to both sides. Did you forget /s? >Does that give Israel enough right to bomb and encroach the land on West Bank? No, it doesn't. Let's get a couple of things clear. What Israeli settlers are doing in West Bank is horrible and I am not condoning that. We are both in agreement here and let's not debate on something we agree on. I am only talking about how Hamas has a large presence in West Bank. The links I shared weren't from ApNews, Japantimes and Le Monde and one Israeli link which shows why Fatah is afraid of losing. Instead of arguing endlessly can we agree that Hamas has presence there (non military)? You initially also said that it's my opinion that reason Fatah is not calling elections becahse Hamas won't win is my own imagination. Do you agree on these? If not can you share some sources of your own? I’m not a Hamas apologist. What they did was the result of years of oppression and terrorism Israel did to Palestinians to steal their land. If you really want to play the blame game you need to educate yourself far beyond October 7th. Yes, Hamas killed civilians. Yes, Israel killed civilians. Is this justified? Read some history beyond October 7th. You don’t even need to go that far behind. Let’s even assume that the 1967 division of two states is something that is acceptable. Check out the lands today, see for yourself how much territory of the UN designated land of Palestine did Israel steal by murdering babies, children, and innocents. There are no two sides to this war because this is a genocide. Fuck off with your genocidal appreciating energy. Fuck off with your virtue signaling Who are you even arguing with, a lot of indians would love Israel style terrorism when done in India, they were already fapping when Israel killed 1300 Palestinians, on the very first 2 days. They would implement the same tactics in Kashmir Lol and they should just keep on oppressing Palestinians and killing their children the entire time, since they are Palestinians they only come as statistics and not human. That's one terrorist IDF killed in June, he was only 2 years old. Lol you must be super dense in the head to even think that. Jews have been basically wiped out from the entire greater middle east. Where do you want them to do? Of course For eg there was this terrorist, who was hiding hamas terrorist and was rightfully killed It definitely won't be your money. I doubt you earn enough to pay taxes anyway. Here's an extensive polls on how Palestinians see Hamas: Key points. * While the majority of Gazans (65%) did think it likely that there would be “a large military conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza” this year, a similar percentage (62%) supported Hamas maintaining a ceasefire with Israel. **Moreover, half (50%) agreed with the following proposal: “Hamas should stop calling for Israel’s destruction**, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.” * **most Gazans expressed a preference for PA administration** and security officials over Hamas—the majority of Gazans (70%) supported a proposal of the PA sending “officials and security officers to Gaza to take over the administration there, with Hamas giving up separate armed units,” including 47% who strongly agreed. * Overall, 57% of Gazans express at least a somewhat positive opinion of Hamas—along with similar percentages of Palestinians in the West Bank (52%) and East Jerusalem (64%)—though Gazans who express this opinion of Hamas are fewer than the number of Gazans who have a positive view of Fatah (64%). However, what /u/devilcross2 is talking about is the illegal take over of Palestinian land by Jewish settlers. That is not related to Hamas. Read this article: Hamas is not bombing Israel from the West Bank, but Palestinians are still being driven out of their lands forcefully there. Just as there is no justification for what Hamas did, there's no justification for Israeli settlements which are illegal under international law. Regardless of anybody’s views on this war, the civilians must be taken care of. Kudos to India for sending this aid package. Exactly. That's why the insane support from Indians (especially sanghis) online for israel. They're vicariously living their own fantasy through Israel's actions. We handed it over to the Egyptian ICRC. They're gonna handle transport and distribution. So hoping for the best? >What Israeli settlers are doing in West Bank is horrible and I am not condoning that. We are both in agreement here and let's not debate on something we agree on. Good. >Do you agree on these? No, I don't. What you've shared is popularity, some sort of building, and officials that have been confirmed by Israeli sources, which I don't believe. You keep on saying large presence. Is that what a large presence is? Oh, so the response to that is to do exactly what was done to them? Are you even aware of what you're saying? Btw, it's not Palestinians' responsibility for what Europeans have done. BTW, since you're so untouched with history, here's a little history [lesson for you.](https://www.thejc.com/comment/comment/so-what-did-the-muslims-do-for-the-jews-1.33597) Bro, I think you've replied to the wrong person. No, I have not. It seems you were replying to the other person and not me. Am I wrong? Cause I haven't read your comment completely. You're more than welcome to suggest better solutions. What's stopping you? My initial discussion with the other guy was related to West Bank. The survey you presented is related to Gaza. Secondly the survey you shared quotes - > But it is organizations like Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Lion’s Den that receive the most widespread popular support in Gaza. About three quarters of Gazans express support for both groups, including 40% who see the Lion’s Den in a “very positive” light, an attitude shared by a similar percentage of West Bank residents. Moreover, when it comes to Iran, which has strongly supported and potentially helped coordinate the attack, about half of Gazans view Tehran as either a “friend of the country” (29%) or security partner (28%), compared to less than a third of West Bankers who would say the same. Which means Gazans have support for organisations which are as as extreme if not more than Hamas - PIJ & Lion's Den >No, I don't. What you've shared is popularity, some sort of building, and officials that have been confirmed by Israeli sources, which I don't believe. Then there's no point in quoting links anymore since you won't believe anything. Also 3 of the 4 links incuding Associated Press have no connections with Israel. Now while you may choose to not believe but anyone can see through your falsehoods immediately. There is widespread support for Hamas in West Bank and they have huge official presence. You believe what you wanna believe. I don't care. All the stuff about hamas offices and officials are coming from Israeli sources. Just a few days ago, they caught a person and paraded him around as the leader of hamas. You talk about propaganda and then close your eyes and believe it. You keep on saying huge presence, so why are there no hamas fighters there? No rockets being fired? No Isreali being killed? Instead, it's the Isreali settling there. Even blind people can see the reality here and you wanna talk about falsehoods. Lol! You are completely ignoring the illegal settlements in West Bank. >Hamas is not bombing Israel from the West Bank, but Palestinians are still being driven out of their lands forcefully there. Just as there is no justification for what Hamas did, there's no justification for Israeli settlements which are illegal under international law. >You believe what you wanna believe. I don't care. All the stuff about hamas offices and officials are coming from Israeli sources. Well Le Monde is French. Associated Press is European. Japan times is well from Japan. Do you also need a link to the world map? Yes but that was not the point I was debating with in the first place. Original comment of OP - \"So, why is Israel committing genocide in West Bank where there is literally zero hamas present?\" My response with proofs was to show that Hamas indeed has presence in West Bank and so much so that even if snap elections are held today, Fatah would lose. You are not very sincere, are you? Why not reply to the rest of the points? Why ignore them? >Well Le Monde is French. Associated Press is European. Japan times is well from Japan. And where do you think they're getting their info from. The current situation can said to be either 20 years old when the Gaza barrier was built and Hamas came to power or since 1948 when the Nakba happened. At the most it can said to be about 100 years old since the British Mandate, which promised the land simultaneously to the Zionists as well as the Palestinians (Divide & Rule). Jews, Muslims, Christians and other ethnicities were coexisting peacefully before that. In fact many Jewish people came to the middle east to escape persecution in Europe during the dark ages and beyond. But yes, humanitarian aid is essential, vital and nonpartisan. There can be no debate about it. >And where do you think they're getting their info from. From Fatah officials and Palestinians in West Bank I don't see that mentioned in the article. And if it was a condition it would be a stupid one. That would be akin to sending aid in WW2 to France but asking Germany to oversee it. > Why not reply to the rest of the points? Why ignore them? When you make a claim and actually bother supporting your arguments with sources I will respond to them. Your point about settlers in West Bank is already something I agree with and we already discussed that. And again you ignore everything else. Shows how sincere you are. You didn't answer even a single question. Those weren't claims they were questions. Understand the difference. Lol it's always fun to see how people react when their claims are destroyed with proof. Keep on rambling about no Hamas in west bank 🥱 7 chapters of Ramayana are over and you continue asking if Sita was male or female. Bhai tu rehne de Dude, come on. The genocide that OP is talking about is the illegal settlements that Israel is building in the west bank. These settlers, with help from IDF, drive out Palestinians and take their land and home. Hamas having support in the West Bank does not justify this genocide. The question asked was simple - what is the justification for Israeli settlements. You are purposefully not answering it. It will be utilised by the terrorists Hamas has strong presence in west bank. Why do you think there has been no election in West Bank. Because everyone with ipta of knowledge about west bank knows hamas will win there India always sends these packages. They did for Turkey as well Popularity and presence are two different things. Why can't you people understand something so simple? And you still won't answer my questions. I wonder why! Owwww....butthurt much? If my claims are destroyed, why not answer my questions then? If hamas has **such a strong presence** in West Bank, why are there no rockets fired from West Bank? Why are there no hamas militants on the streets of West Bank? Why are Isreali settlers there and not armed forces? Go ahead and answer me. But we both know you won't. Just google. There are thousands of hamas terrorist in that region. I have no idea how you just claimed that there is almost 0 hamas presence Show me. I am not justifying Israeli settlers and the Zionists. I am just saying that Hamas has presence in West Bank. That is not justification for Israeli settlers. Israeli settlers are condemned by everybody and even Israelis themselves. I’ve seen immoral eviction of Palestinians from settlements. I’ve seen Israel be oppressive and heavy handed in policing their border. I’ve seen Palestinian civilian deaths when Israelis do counter-fires against Hamas fighters setting up their batteries in civilian populated areas. I have sympathy for Palestinian civilians and supported them. I’m not actually a big fan of the Israeli government, especially after the USS Liberty incident. But no I’ve never seen them do anything like this, walking down streets just massacring innocent civilians. neither side is blameless? bffr one has been bombing, stealing & kicking people out of their homes for decades & the other was the consequence of the other. for every action there is an equal reaction. saying shit like take humanity side = to supporting genocide. educate yourself. Because news flash. Hamas does not only have militia and rocket fighting gunmen. Your tiny pea sized brain seems unable to comprehend that Hamas is a political organisation which does a lot of work in Palestine apart from firing rockets and shooting civilians. For that they need to maintain massive presence even in West Bank. Any other questions that you have or are you done for the day? Let me say what most of your kind of apologists don't say out loud. You and your kind of apologists were most likely celebrating the Oct 7th massacre. Everything is fair 'because' Israel has been historically heavy in dealing with the so-called freedom fighters. Who shields behind civilians? The Islamic terrorists. They have historically done so. The Hamas terrorists, Islamic State, Taliban - these are the kind of 'freedom fighters' who will openly kill civilians, rape women and behead children. So, again Fuck off. Why don't you go in the streets and truly celebrate the people you support? This is literally the first article that popped up. Honestly it should have been your job to provide the resource. Since you are the one who said hamas isn't present in West Bank. But now you show me where you got that \"Hamas is not there in west bank\" You are arguing with someone who calls a spade a spade. I don't look at the religion of the person dead to determine how I should react. Israel literally killed 204 palestinians in 2022, these are all just excuses to commit genocide while also trying to gain sympathy Maybe because you said this - > You believe what you wanna believe. I don't care No point in arguing with a person who has self declared that they are not gonna care regardless. You show this to these fucking terror apologists and they say, \"So what, but Israel bad. India bad. World bad. Everyone hates us\". Go back further in history and you’ll see the oppressors of today are the oppressed of yesterday. As I said, this conflict goes back thousands of years and both sides want revenge and think they’re just fighting for what’s rightfully theirs. News Reports can not be trusted in this genocide. Media houses are all funded by people with agendas. jews were oppressed by nazi germany? Following World War II and the Holocaust, international pressure mounted for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, leading to the creation of Israel in 1948. just say you support genocide. \\>stealing there always have lived jews in that region and land was divided according to population moreover the entire region belongs to jews as much as it belongs to arabs, people say palestenians were removed from their homes by jews but the fact is that jews were there always more jews migrated to the land after ww2 but no one can say the land belongs to palestenians exclusively. that is y the 2 state solution that Gazans have declined always. the entire war was started by palestenians all they had to do was to accept the proposed solution to the problem but they declined and rather decided to go to war multiple times. currently israel is in a position of power so yes it is bombing people which is sad and horrible for humanity but that in no way means palestenians are angels who have done nothing wrong. and yes neither side is blameless you start a war you also have to suffer the consequences Israelis do not need to kill. They can get the land without killing. Eh, educating you is not on my agenda today. Read some history. Jews have been persecuted under Muslim rule since (again for the 3rd time) 1000s of years. Their argument is that they’ve had their own state for the first time in centuries and they’re protecting it. Anyways, I don’t care about this thread anymore. Bye. Lol that's what you think, but in reality you are nothing but a dense idiot and a tool. Step 1: Kill civilians Step 2: Say that was a weapons hotspot for terrorists Step 3: Calm down public opinion by saying terrorists were hiding behind babies. Step 4: Manipulated fools celebrate you for killing innocent civilians Step 5: Take their land Why don’t you look at actual video sources of Israeli captives. Beheaded children? That was AI generated which fools like Ben Shapiro shared on their social media. Nobody was celebrating the October 7th massacre. And this isn’t about religion. There are Palestinian Christians, Muslims, and Jews. Israel, even though a Jewish state, is atheist. the excess land that israel has is bc of the war it won that it did not start its not called stealing. people who started the war wanted to steal jewish land, clown. go read some history, Israel has always accepted the 2 state solution its the other party that is divided So if somebody comes and takes your house, are we supposed to shift you into the neighbors house? There is no escape from Israeli bombs, they provide safe routes to designated areas and then drop bombs when civilians are on that safe route. It’s not called a war when one of them has nuclear weapons, media control and unlimited funds. It’s a genocide. Condemnation means jack shit when they haven't stopped. After the war ended, Israel kept capturing more & more of their land tho. you can’t deny the fact that palestine is/was very much trying to protect their land too. atleast right now, the only victims i see are palestinians. they were the ones who were mostly displaced before & are being killed now. at the end it doesn’t matter who started the war but about who pays the price for it. Well, not that I expected a nuanced rebuttal from you but this is frankly embarrassing. Just call people names if you don't have an argument. Israel says....lol.....we are done. >But now you show me where you got that \"Hamas is not there in west bank\" Watch the Piers Morgan and Bassem Youssef interview. What? Hamas doesn't have rockets and militia? Who do you think attacked on 7th Oct? Man, you just go from dumb to dumber. Hamas makes homemade rockets that they have used previously. What happened? Your isreali sources didn't tell you that? You need to enlighten yourself more Yeah, when you bring me isreali stuff as facts, I won't. You're so dumb you think a few so-called officials make for a big presence. 👏 >What? Hamas doesn't have rockets and militia? Who do you think attacked on 7th Oct? Learn to read. Hamas does not only have militia and rocket fighting gunmen. This is the 4th time you have embarrassed yourself France, Japan, Europe are not in Israel genius I have and he doesn't raise any good point. Mention one good point that he raised. Not expecting much for Zionist supporters, who fail to see the atrocities that IDF has committed over the years because, this is what idiots like you dream about. You don't know any history, what can anyone expect anything from dense people like you. I hate every atrocity equally. It's people like you who pick and choose their outrage. And that's why I am dense because to me the religion of a victim does not matter. I am sorry, I don't see a point in this conversation anymore. Be happy in the hateful bubble you live in. I don't have to. You're probably someone who doesn't get satire. I can't help you on that. >Learn to read genius. \"Hamas does not only have militia and rocket fighting gunmen.\" Okay. So what? My point still stands. Why do you keep on dodging? What are you scared of? >This is the 4th time you have embarrassed yourself Okay, and? You don't make mistakes? Are you superhuman? Oh, right, right. You are. And you clearly don't understand sarcasm, genius. You're such a buffoon. It's like each statement is dumber than the last. If you're so convinced you’ve proved something, then why not move on, hmmm? It's cause you know you got nothing but bs. Good riddance >Okay. So what? My point still stands. Why do you keep on dodging? What are you scared of? Lol I am afraid that your inability to read may embarrass you even further. And he's still afraid to answer. Well done!! You should try for the Olympics since you're such a great runner. Afraid to answer what genius? Forgot how to read, dum-dum? Your sheer retardation has made me forget many other things. I am simply stunned now. Now tell me what else you need answered genius I'm not your mother. I'm not gonna spoonfeed you. If you wanna know, read back, dum-dum. Yeah went up and saw how you couldn't understand basic english. Went up further and saw how you wouldn't accept links of Hamas being active in West Bank. Also saw your inability to figure out that France and Japan are not in Israel. And yet you still couldn't figure out what I asked you? Wow, you're a genuine buffoon, dum-dum. > And yet you still couldn't figure out what I asked you? Nope I don't speak retard very well. Could you rephrase again in clear English? He's right. Look at the lavish lifestyle of senior Hamas officials compared to the average Palestinian person. Hamas leader's family literally lives in fucking ISRAEL. Top Dawg himself lives in Qatar in a luxury hotel. His whole points were based on how Israel is killing civilians. Who haven't done anything. But he fails to mention that is the tactic of Hamas. They hide behind kids. They make their millitary infra underground a hospital or within residential buildings. Now what is Israel supposed to do just sit there keep intercepting their cheap missile with expensive iron dome missiles? And not protect their citizens? They send out message signals so that civilians get out in time. Before actually striking the building they strike them with warning shots. What's the other alternative? Hamas main agenda is to execute every jew in the world. Also let's not deflect from the original point you still haven't showed any proof that there is no Hamas in West Bank. What about before hamas? Read some history. You'll get to know it was Israel and Netanyahu who helped create hamas. Again speaking in Retard. Get some sleep dude And yet you're replying to it. So, I guess you speak it pretty well, dum-dum. Nope I don't. I am clueless what you are talking about. Please humble request to speak in English You keep saying something about not being my mum when no one claimed that in the first place. Is that Retardspeak? Go ask someone who has a mom. He'll get it, dum-dum. Asked someone who had a mum. He agreed with me that you are a retard. What else do you have? So, you don't have a mom. I'm so sorry, dum-dum. Maybe that's why you ended up like this. I'm sorry for you, dum-dum. You clearly don't know intifadas. And neither has the comedian that you mentioned. >Israel says....lol.....we are done. So can I do \"Palestine-allied country says... lol... we are done\"? Hamas is in the West Bank as well. 480 of the suspects were Hamas. A good number of Palestinian children have died in West Bank since August by Israeli attacks. There's no hamas over there. It's ridiculous how India's foreign policy always works in their favour. That is quite the feat. First they bought Russian oil without pissing off the west and now they're sending aid without pissing off the west. This time it's actually a really good thing. But Israel has also purposely killed civilians. Why are you being a Zionist in India If israel didn’t create hamas in the first place, nothing would have happened West needs India to counter China Agreed! Absolutely there are many innocents in gaza that has nothing to do with the attacks,especially the kids. Even during afghan war, india sent a ton of aid to afghan folks. I am glad to see this. India needs to keep up this work! I agree with you on all of that. Although, this conflict is not 1000s years old, it began in 1948. This is a colony. Just like british colony in india, except, imagine a lot more british ppl came and started living in india, and pushed all india in one state...like gaza. >That was AI generated which fools like Ben Shapiro shared on their social media. AI is notoriously unreliable in detecting which images are AI and which are real. Absolutely right. Regardless of who is at fault there, it's the civilian population that is at risk. And in this case, it's the Palestinians because they don't have the socio-economic infrastructure of Israel. > educate yourself Being so condescending is not usually the best way to win people over to your cause. Maybe you educate yourself about that. Totally agreed, few people decides they want more and innocent civilians die. IMO that's a simplistic and unidimensional view of the conflict. It's not inaccurate, but it's not the complete picture either. I'd advice you to go back further and read about the treatment of Jews by various parties since the medieval times. They were discriminated against in every country they lived in, and muslim-majority countries were no exception. When I say the conflict is thousands of years old, I'm including the history of the Jewish people because I think that history is an important part of today's Israel even if the state didn't exist back then. Haven’t been wiped out, they migrated to Israel, the middle eastern jews in Israel are called Mizrahims, they migrated to Israel when the nation was founded and number around 3 million or so today. I know that. Jews were fucked by a lot of ppl, culminating with holocaust, and i empathize with them having safe land. But that doesnt mean you take some other 3rd world country's land and give it to them. Palestine was a british colony and UN gave that land to the jews. Palestinians nor the neighboring country's accepted it. They gave the land and shit ton of money and weapons to jews to colonize that country. Hence, thats a colony. If they had given part of england with england parliaments permission, thats a whole different story. Palestinians did not agree to this. On top of that, UN's idea was that they go there and form democracy with local palestinians getting equal rights. But that was a pipe dream, that would have never happened. No only did they colonize it, they immediately started cleansing it with Nakba, mass displacement of local population. Same way British did after 1857 mutiny. Entire delhi was demolished (we have pictures from before 1857, and from 1860 both from jama masjid, also happened in other major cities) Indian communities weren't the same again, same as palestinian communities. India truly became 3rd world country then. You're right, which is why I said you can't take sides here in my original comment. We are in the situation we are now because of decisions made in the past. Decisions that we can't undo. Decisions that we have to live with, even if they were wrong. i think we can have a take. Like, dumping 6000 bombs in 2 days over civilians is war crimes and must be stopped. This is more than any even in WW2. The goal should be only to get the hostages out safe, and destroy hamas. Enter gaza and destroy hamas. Dont carpet bomb the city with 1 million kids in it. We can have more takes too, like, Jewish settlements in west bank need to stop immediately. According to many resolutions, that is where Palestinians would find their safe country. Those settlements and armed murdering of palestinians there using international help must be stopped. We can definitely have these kinds of takes. Most issues are because of past decisions and missteps. We have to decide what is the right path going forward, given the past. \"War\". Google the military capability of 1 side and the military capability of the other. This war is between Israel and Hamas, so if Hamas doesn’t exist anymore isn’t that great? Not quite. That's just a lie Israel, ie, the occupying force propagated. There were no Hamas before '87. Who were they bombing, displacing and mass murdering before that? There are no Hamas in the west bank. Why is the west bank losing area and why do the stats read so many Palestinian deaths there? Either Palestine is wiped off the map or Israel keeps trying. There is no middle ground. Just the month before Hamas attack. How many Palestinians were bombed? (Look it up, the number is in hundreds). IDF terrorists continued to bring in terrorists and displace Palestinians and take over their homes. (These settlers also have tonnes of murder and rape charges on them, none of which have seen court)"
