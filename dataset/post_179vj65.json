Wtf, do you expect from a 4 year old phone to be brand new, then just don't do exchanges.\nThough I could have paid the amount but this would have irked me for life that I was made fool , thus declined the exchange.\nThis looks like a scam where they first promise higher exchange value  and once the buyer commits , deliberately find faults to bring the value down.",

        "Darn! their inspection is so minute, they should be employed by the Central Excise and Customs department.\n\nMy experience with FK has always been bad.  But few items are exclusive to them and hence can't give them up in all.\n\nI am told that the FlipKart  'Wishmasters' (delivery personnel) are instructed to reject the exchange on any ground possible.   Many a times the buyers not wanting to lose the product, would delink the exchange and pay the full price.  So for mobile phones, I either try to sell it on Cashify or gift it to a relatives kid.\n\nAnd trying to return an item.....unlocks new nightmares.",
        "I exchanged my phone in this sale without any hassle",
        "This is common by Flipkart. Never exchange Phones on Flipkart or any other shop. Best way is to exchange it on OLX or Directly to a customer.",
        "Almost all the exchanges work like this. I had a similar experience with cashify recently. I was selling my iPhone 12 and it had minor discolorations on the frame which is expected on anodised aluminium body. While choosing the phone's condition there was no option to choose paint discoloration so instead I chose 3+ dents and 3+ scratches even though it didn't have any of those. I got a quote of 25k which  was pretty good. \n\nI thought this has to be the lowest quote for my phone and there is no way they'll deduct more after inspection. Boy was I wrong! After inspection they brought down the  final amount to 20k!! \n\nI argued with them how it can reduce from 25k to 20k even after choosing the worst possible condition during the initial assessment, despite not having any flaws. The guy called up someone and they increased the final quote to 22k but I didn't sell it to them. Wrote a long email to their customer care and it fell on deaf ears.\n\nFinally I sold it on FB marketplace for 28k after 3-4 days.",

        "I exchanged my mom's old Samsung galaxy J5 2016 (a 7 year old phone) on amazon for a brand new OnePlus Nord CE 3, got a discount of 3700, but since a button was missing the final price was 3500, which is still a pretty sweet deal for a phone that fails when I connect it to the internet. The final price came to around 20k after the SBI discount.",
        "Lucky you !!",
        "another day, another flipkart horror story .....",
        "Same thing happened on Amazon as well. Minute speck of discoloration and delivery guy told 6% of the exchange value will be deducted. We told him to send a SMS or mail or something in written and we will send the money but he went and told he will send next day and never heard from him after.",
        "Same thing happened with me , my mom used the phone , it was a perfect phone like new one . They was a small dot paint chipped , he marked it as dent. I guess something is going on with the flipkart people",
        "I think I should skip Flipkart.\n\nAlso magicpin trust me.",
        "Even stranger case with me.\n\nSame issue as you. Tiny dot being told as body dent. Wishmasters dont have option to devalue it seems so i rescheduled tl today. Now when i call them and ask if i can pay full amount and get the phone, they say its not possible. So now only option left is to cancel but even that is not done yet. Wonder what will happen.",
        "Pretty much standard for these exchanges. Cashify assessed a tiny scratch near sim hole as body damage & reduced Rs. 3000 from a Rs. 9000 exchange. This was after I had already updated the phone condition as \"Good\" with minor scratches on side panel. They said since it's near the sim hole, it'll not be counted as a scratch but as damage. Finally settled for 7K. \n\nThey have done it multiple times in the past - claiming flawless condition from old gadgets & reducing price by choosing the biggest defect they could get away with. They are incentivized to do it.",
        "I am sick and tired of seeing these posts about Flipkart. Can we collectively do something about Flipkart and make them realise that they need to amend their ways? Please don’t suggest “Boycott them or don’t buy from them” coz we all know that won’t work.",

        "You’re better off selling it on Cashify, at least they will  consider normal wear and tear and not go crazy like this!\n\nEither ways, avoid buying from Flipkart, they are turning into snapdeal and will eventually be bought out or rebranded to Walmart Online",
        "The delivery guy gets chewed out later if there is any issue. That's why they tend to be so anal about it. \n\nIn fact, with Amazon, phone exchange orders won't even get delivered in my area most of the time. The delivery guys don't want the hassle at all because they are in for pain from both customer and Amazon side. So, they just mark the product with delivery failed 3 times over 3 days and send it back hoping  that the customer would get irritated enough to not try again.\n\nI ordered a couple of phones some time back and on the same day. The one without any exchange got delivered, but the exchange one got sent back after 3 days of delivery attempt failed messages. I had to reorder 4 times and wait for a month with repeated escalations before the product was delivered with exchange.",
        "Faced somewhat similar  with Flipkart's exchange policy.\n\nThey changed my exchange later method to sell back thank you card option, upon failure to collect old device due to seller's fault.\n\nExchange later option has higher value coz promotions.\nThey even mentioned in email to match price difference by giftcard.\n\nOnce I sold my old phone at a lower price they seemed to have forgotten \nabout price difference matching.\n\nThe customer service agents are pathetic and keep on delaying complaints raised.\nMost of them act dumb when I mentioned the above email.\nIts difficult to get money back from Flipkart.Took almost a month for additional giftcard amount.",

Camera was top notch, better than my iPhone X.",
        "> This looks like a scam where they first promise higher exchange value and once the buyer commits , deliberately find faults to bring the value down.\n\nHow is it a scam when it is mentioned on the page before you confirm the device for exchange.\n\n> Wtf, do you expect from a 4 year old phone to be brand new, then just don't do exchanges. \n\nWill you buy a refurbished product with scratches from flipkart or amazon. \n\nAmazon already gives lower value on exchange. I got burnt with exchange last year. Unless you have a deadphone, then it isn't worth exchange on either website.",
        "It's a scam because my device qualifies for some amount which is later denied.\n\nIf you see Flipkart definition of refurbished then it clearly says that it can have minor signs of use. I really hope you have read it.",

        "Well, at least you declined the exchange and didn't give them the satisfaction to fool you. I suppose, most people will still go with the exchange and pay the extra amount due to 'body damage' to get their hands on an i-Phone. Such is the lure of Apple :(",

Raised a ticket with flipkart support and they gave me a resolution date of 19th which is 1 day after the last day mentioned for the exchange.   \n\n\nThis pretty much confirms that they never planned to follow through so that they don't have to give the exchange bonus out.",

        "I always upvote shitty customer service stories because as consumers we are not expected to haggle with FK or any ecommerce company. Ideally, whatever is quoted should be honoured. If FK delivery guy does not accept the exchange, thats fine too. It should be a rejection. But this haggling business tells me this is typically bania buddhi on FK's part. FK probably has some incentive scheme where the difference between the quoted exchange and any additional money off discovered by the FK delivery guy. \n\non the other hand, they outright refuse warranty, make you run through hoops if the phone doesnt work as intended during the warranty period. \n\nCustomer service laws are non-existent and that is deliberate. ecommerce retailers and basically any B2C, food retail company cites labour and welfare costs to avoid compliance with laws. \n\nFK has always been shady. I never used them except for buying something cheap and standard upto INR 500. For me, anything more than that deserves a visit to the store before I can buy it.",

That ahole was in such hurry he refused to wait and went away without completing the order. He was also very rude. I filed a complaint against him. I called flipkart customer care for 3 days as my order was showing out for delivery but not getting info of delivery person. They promised me they will deliver the order. After waiting for 4 days the delivery centre cancelled my order without my consent. It was a very bad and frustrating experience. Flipkart needs to do something about it.

    "light_cleaned_title": "Horrible Flipkart exchange experience",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "During Flipkart BBD saw offer that Flipkart was giving additional 2000 off on mobile phone exchange and my wife wanted to upgrade her old Android to iPhone. The Flipkart person tried his best to find faults and later found a mark the size of tip of needle and declared that this will be covered under body damage. Wtf, do you expect from a 4 year old phone to be brand new, then just don't do exchanges. Though I could have paid the amount but this would have irked me for life that I was made fool , thus declined the exchange. This looks like a scam where they first promise higher exchange value and once the buyer commits , deliberately find faults to bring the value down.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Share the pictures of the mobile phone only then we can say if the agent did it on purpose or not. FK does it all the time. Darn! their inspection is so minute, they should be employed by the Central Excise and Customs department. My experience with FK has always been bad. But few items are exclusive to them and hence can't give them up in all. I am told that the FlipKart 'Wishmasters' (delivery personnel) are instructed to reject the exchange on any ground possible. Many a times the buyers not wanting to lose the product, would delink the exchange and pay the full price. So for mobile phones, I either try to sell it on Cashify or gift it to a relatives kid. And trying to return an item.....unlocks new nightmares. I exchanged my phone in this sale without any hassle This is common by Flipkart. Never exchange Phones on Flipkart or any other shop. Best way is to exchange it on OLX or Directly to a customer. Almost all the exchanges work like this. I had a similar experience with cashify recently. I was selling my iPhone 12 and it had minor discolorations on the frame which is expected on anodised aluminium body. While choosing the phone's condition there was no option to choose paint discoloration so instead I chose 3+ dents and 3+ scratches even though it didn't have any of those. I got a quote of 25k which was pretty good. I thought this has to be the lowest quote for my phone and there is no way they'll deduct more after inspection. Boy was I wrong! After inspection they brought down the final amount to 20k!! I argued with them how it can reduce from 25k to 20k even after choosing the worst possible condition during the initial assessment, despite not having any flaws. The guy called up someone and they increased the final quote to 22k but I didn't sell it to them. Wrote a long email to their customer care and it fell on deaf ears. Finally I sold it on FB marketplace for 28k after 3-4 days. Amazon provides fixed exchange values. Flipkart provides exchange value with up to mark. Gift it to relatives kids Demm u should be my relative😂💀 Is FB marketplace a thing? I exchanged my mom's old Samsung galaxy J5 2016 (a 7 year old phone) on amazon for a brand new OnePlus Nord CE 3, got a discount of 3700, but since a button was missing the final price was 3500, which is still a pretty sweet deal for a phone that fails when I connect it to the internet. The final price came to around 20k after the SBI discount. Lucky you !! another day, another flipkart horror story ..... Same thing happened on Amazon as well. Minute speck of discoloration and delivery guy told 6% of the exchange value will be deducted. We told him to send a SMS or mail or something in written and we will send the money but he went and told he will send next day and never heard from him after. Same thing happened with me , my mom used the phone , it was a perfect phone like new one . They was a small dot paint chipped , he marked it as dent. I guess something is going on with the flipkart people I think I should skip Flipkart. Also magicpin trust me. Even stranger case with me. Same issue as you. Tiny dot being told as body dent. Wishmasters dont have option to devalue it seems so i rescheduled tl today. Now when i call them and ask if i can pay full amount and get the phone, they say its not possible. So now only option left is to cancel but even that is not done yet. Wonder what will happen. Pretty much standard for these exchanges. Cashify assessed a tiny scratch near sim hole as body damage & reduced Rs. 3000 from a Rs. 9000 exchange. This was after I had already updated the phone condition as \"Good\" with minor scratches on side panel. They said since it's near the sim hole, it'll not be counted as a scratch but as damage. Finally settled for 7K. They have done it multiple times in the past - claiming flawless condition from old gadgets & reducing price by choosing the biggest defect they could get away with. They are incentivized to do it. I am sick and tired of seeing these posts about Flipkart. Can we collectively do something about Flipkart and make them realise that they need to amend their ways? Please don’t suggest “Boycott them or don’t buy from them” coz we all know that won’t work. The same has happened to me. It's a daylight scam nothing more. You’re better off selling it on Cashify, at least they will consider normal wear and tear and not go crazy like this! Either ways, avoid buying from Flipkart, they are turning into snapdeal and will eventually be bought out or rebranded to Walmart Online The delivery guy gets chewed out later if there is any issue. That's why they tend to be so anal about it. In fact, with Amazon, phone exchange orders won't even get delivered in my area most of the time. The delivery guys don't want the hassle at all because they are in for pain from both customer and Amazon side. So, they just mark the product with delivery failed 3 times over 3 days and send it back hoping that the customer would get irritated enough to not try again. I ordered a couple of phones some time back and on the same day. The one without any exchange got delivered, but the exchange one got sent back after 3 days of delivery attempt failed messages. I had to reorder 4 times and wait for a month with repeated escalations before the product was delivered with exchange. Faced somewhat similar with Flipkart's exchange policy. They changed my exchange later method to sell back thank you card option, upon failure to collect old device due to seller's fault. Exchange later option has higher value coz promotions. They even mentioned in email to match price difference by giftcard. Once I sold my old phone at a lower price they seemed to have forgotten about price difference matching. The customer service agents are pathetic and keep on delaying complaints raised. Most of them act dumb when I mentioned the above email. Its difficult to get money back from Flipkart.Took almost a month for additional giftcard amount. They are just trying to ask u for some extra money at time of exchange and revalue the product Chup re 1 din gaya nai ki Fk Fk Fk chalu Had the same experience with iPhone. Exchange value quoted was 6.5k and I got a phone worth 14k. The guy came and told he will take it only got 3k🥺 I rejected the offer and paid full price for the mobile, sold the old phone for 6.5k via OLX. iPhone 7 Plus, very good condition, 5 years old. Camera was top notch, better than my iPhone X. > This looks like a scam where they first promise higher exchange value and once the buyer commits , deliberately find faults to bring the value down. How is it a scam when it is mentioned on the page before you confirm the device for exchange. > Wtf, do you expect from a 4 year old phone to be brand new, then just don't do exchanges. Will you buy a refurbished product with scratches from flipkart or amazon. Amazon already gives lower value on exchange. I got burnt with exchange last year. Unless you have a deadphone, then it isn't worth exchange on either website. It's a scam because my device qualifies for some amount which is later denied. If you see Flipkart definition of refurbished then it clearly says that it can have minor signs of use. I really hope you have read it. Yess , I am thinking of going to cashify. It won't have irked me if Flipkart has not promoted this \" extra discount on exchange \". They are just using this gimmick Use imgur man, the service you’re using is useless. Kyu jaan ke buch dents & scratch add kar diya? Jab inspection hone hi wali hai, kaunsa Mahatma banne chale? FUCK does it all the time. My wife advised that I should have given some money to the wishmaster and made a deal. But I am too bad in these street smart tricks. You will get more money if you sell it to a local mobile seller. Don't bother exchanging it on flip Flipkart totally sale 1st copy of all brand and if u receive damaged or wrong than block I r account pls online shopping on Amazon This is usual for this sort of device pickups. I've had exactly the same experience selling the device on Cashify as well. They nitpick too much about the device, and will always pay you lesser than the quoted amount over miniscule dents or scratches. Flipkart exchange is terrible, use something like Cashify. Amazon has the best exchange .Ordered an iphone the delivery guy did not check for any faults he just said reset and give and done received my iphone too. Amazon is the BEST It's not about becoming a Mahatma, my friend. It's about getting a realistic quote in the beginning so that I don't get low-balled at the time of inspection. Now, was it realistic? It's just like OLX, but has a far better reach due to Facebooks huge userbase You are missing the point. I did it to check the accuracy of their initial quotes and unrealistic final quote And you’re missing the point. This is not a man-to-man exchange like a pawn shop, in the world of business and legal exchanges - there’s no soul. This is my experience too. I have complained many a times but of no avail. It is under minor impact on body. Image 4. > Is it accessible only through facebook? ( what I want is, can I use it without logging into Facebook or something) My friend asked a flipkart delivery guy why are they doing this after getting rejected 3 times for this exact reason. These delivery agents are asked to do this specifically. You won't face this issue anywhere else other than flipkart Flop kart is the biggest scammer in e-commerce industry …..slowly slowly Amazon is also following thr path I think you need to have a Facebook account to access it. Not very sure though Seems like you're an expert in this and have figured out everything there is to know. Good for you Better exchange on amazon. Cashify are no saints either. Did Amazon reduced the exchange amount while delivering? A point mark on my phone 1 year old body costed me 750 rs more I had the option to pay remaining amount but too bad 3000 special discount was too much to miss so i proceeded to purchase it and paid 750 Effing fck flipkart they do find send fckups who find small imperfections, it happened to me but i rejected to give my phone for exchange Don't know about you, but my experience with Flipkart here has always been good. I brought a Moto Phone with exchange and it works like a charm. Good for you You are seriously comparing a dent with a mark of needle size caused from mail while putting and pulling phone in cover ? I would have accepted if it was a real dent. The Flipkart guy first checked physical damage , couldn't find , then ran tests on mobile and after that said that the mobile back has concaved ( which I asked to prove ) and then last resort he picked this one as body defect. Well, at least you declined the exchange and didn't give them the satisfaction to fool you. I suppose, most people will still go with the exchange and pay the extra amount due to 'body damage' to get their hands on an i-Phone. Such is the lure of Apple :( Yeah it beats kavorka in potency As someone said here in the comments section, FlipKart's inspection team should start training the Central Excise. On the bright side, I exchanged my 2 year old iPhone 12 and it felt like winning the jackpot. seriously, i got the best of a bargain and no questions asked. May be it depends on the person who comes for device collection I guess. Happened with me too with amazon for a refrigerator.. Flipkart is not customer friendly. They think like a small shop owner. Amazon is where they need to learn good customer service from. Yes Facebook account needed. Amazon supremacy. Lmao this is nothing. My delivery boy from Amazon was so scared that he would take a \"faulty\" 4 year old phone for exchange and would be scolded by his manager, that this mother fucker cancelled my order itself right in front of my eyes even after I told him that I would pay the fucking exchange money. Absolute retard of a delivery boy. This happened today. Fucking hell. This companies want a brand new phone in the name of exchange product. Meanwhile my experience today. > The Flipkart guy first checked physical damage , couldn't find , then ran tests on mobile and after that said that the mobile back has concaved ( which I asked to prove ) and then last resort he picked this one as body defect. Will you buy the device refurbished from flipkart or amazon with that level of damage? Bro I'll give 2k for that phone if it works fine. I'm looking for deals like that to help a few people out. Here baccha have my iPhone 4 Gift from your new dadaji 💀 Well too bad I'll reject the order altogether. Order it the second time if they're playing nice else reject again. Will sell the old phone offline then reorder. Should have posted on OLX would have got around 8-9k for it Agree about the returns thing. I noticed that during the current BBD sale, absolutely nothing was returnable! I actually opted to buy stuff from Amazon because they still have the option to return. I exchanged 2 old phones. One plus 3t (2016) for 5200. And Xiaomi A3 (2017) for 3300. Nice deals both. Its more of a problem with the delivery guy. Here is a trick which worked for me. From the get go, be authoritative with the delivery guy, not rude, but be stern. Many of us try to be nice, hoping that they won't create problems during exchange, but do the opposite. I first start questioning them, like who are you, whats your name, how do i believe you're flipkart delivery boy, show me your id, are you qualified for mobile inspection, show me some certificate that you have done some course or training mobile phones, etc etc. This puts them on the backfoot and they avoid scamming you, as they do not want a troubled customer. The idea is not to force them to take a fault phone, but to keep them in check. Flipkart exchange is just awful. Amazon was much better for me few years back. The guy just switched the phone on checked it's getting on and left. r/flopkart #Avoid Flipkart. I repeat AVOID FLIPKART. Flipkart is horrible. They wouldn't return an unopened furniture I had ordered. Amazon has no such issues. Damn people actually do exchange on flipkart and amazon. The exchange rate is fucking horrible it's shows 7500rs for my s20 plus. Oh so this the issue I am currently facing I hv ordered a phone with exchange few days back on FK and it's been out for delivery since 15 Oct and still not received.On ekart logistics website it shows every day unsuccessful attempt. I didn't knew this is done deliberately since this is my first time buying phone with exchange. I ordered my Phone on the first day of the sale with Exchange and chose the pickup after 7 days option, its been 9 days and no one has come to pickup, they send a msg every morning that it will be picked up today and like clockwork at around 9 pm they send a msg that it was not possible. Raised a ticket with flipkart support and they gave me a resolution date of 19th which is 1 day after the last day mentioned for the exchange. This pretty much confirms that they never planned to follow through so that they don't have to give the exchange bonus out. Normal day in Flipkart 😶 Both amazon and Flipkart are worst in terms of exchange. It’s the fault of delivery guy he says if I take damaged phone then it will be deducted from my salary. Frustrated I went to Croma and had a wonderful experience got the amount which I expected. I think they have tie up with cashify maybe. I always upvote shitty customer service stories because as consumers we are not expected to haggle with FK or any ecommerce company. Ideally, whatever is quoted should be honoured. If FK delivery guy does not accept the exchange, thats fine too. It should be a rejection. But this haggling business tells me this is typically bania buddhi on FK's part. FK probably has some incentive scheme where the difference between the quoted exchange and any additional money off discovered by the FK delivery guy. on the other hand, they outright refuse warranty, make you run through hoops if the phone doesnt work as intended during the warranty period. Customer service laws are non-existent and that is deliberate. ecommerce retailers and basically any B2C, food retail company cites labour and welfare costs to avoid compliance with laws. FK has always been shady. I never used them except for buying something cheap and standard upto INR 500. For me, anything more than that deserves a visit to the store before I can buy it. Aise chor harkatein krke to ye company chal rhi h. Wrna bheekh na mile iss company ko. So how this exchange thing works like you pay full price first and then they will give refund? Or just discounted price? I can even see what the damage is. True Is nord ce 3 good? Most believable paid commenter. Flipkart is untrustworthy when it comes to electronics, I just bargain offline with Flipkart and Amazon prices and get some more discount foo This is not at all Flipkart exclusive, Amazon's exchange experience is the same. Last year I ordered a refrigerator, offering my 10 year old Godrej 230 L fridge in exchange. The fridge was working fine, no issues at all. I just needed more space. They showed 2500 as exchange value. When the guys came for pickup, they found a dent on the lower part of the body which was barely noticeable. They said because of that dent, exchange value will get reduced to Rs. 400. *bought Yeah, they're all frauds. Don't trust Flipkart, it's just Shitkart. Yes. Amazon also reduces the exchange price by 70% for such minor issues. Flipkart will have slightly more nuanced assessment. FuckKart? Yes, they are. My experience was good too for a few years, until this year where I received a defective phone and Flipkart refused to replace it. I've stopped buying from Flipkart. Boycott them. Send WhatsApp forwards and write social media posts about your bad experiences. Actually, WhatsApp statuses will be seen. Of course most importantly, write to consumer forum and pile on the list of cases. Try to get some news organisation to write about this. They have done it before for certain cases. And if you do get screwed over like getting a defective product for example, then definitely take them to court. More and more legal losses will force them to change. Refurbished yes. If it's marked brand new then no. No, they think like a big company that scams it's customers on purpose and constantly gets away with it You pay the discounted price and then the delivery guy will inspect the phone. What if they reject? So he will not deliver the new phone? I had kindof similar problem with FK , they took the phone saying money will be transferred in bank account but didn't send money even after 15 days of pickup . After a week of running to customer care executives they finally gave money in form of a stupid giftcard . Never exchanged anything after that from Fraudkart Never have i gotten a reduced price at Amazon after inspection. If you give adequate information before putting in an exchange you will get the same price mentioned in the app or they will just not accept the exchange from their end. You will also get 129rs back if the exchange declines from their end and you specify it to customer care. He will first inspect the exchange phone and will then inform accordingly about the options and then only handover the new phone. So if exchange phone is rejected then I suppose you either pay the full exchange amount or he might not deliver the new phone. Rest you can check in the faq of how exchange process works on any product which has this option. How is exchange experience in stores? Like imagine store or reliance digital. Flipkart sucks, I too ordered a pixel 7 with exchange in BBD sale. As I have to go to work I am not available 8-6. so, I asked the delivery person to deliver in the evening. Initially he refused. But then he had to do some exchange near my area he came that evening, as it was on short notice, when he came I told him to wait few minutes till I can reset my device. That ahole was in such hurry he refused to wait and went away without completing the order. He was also very rude. I filed a complaint against him. I called flipkart customer care for 3 days as my order was showing out for delivery but not getting info of delivery person. They promised me they will deliver the order. After waiting for 4 days the delivery centre cancelled my order without my consent. It was a very bad and frustrating experience. Flipkart needs to do something about it. Just copy pasting other company’s idea is not enough, you also need to provide good service. At this point even Alibaba feels better than flipkart. Amazon is way better my brother camera flash was damaged but they give full replacement price that is 7000 But what about those mobiles where its only sold through Flipkart like Pixel, Moto. Not sure bro. But if you are scammed, the Flipkart team doesn't give a shit about it. You cannot even call them on a customer care number, because all customer care numbers are closed. I raised many call back requests through the app and later took a screenshot and posted on twitter tagging the CEO, and then got a call from them. Such a cheater company. yep, pretty good. a very balanced phone worth the money at 20-21k, 25k felt a bit too steep tho They just want you to offer bribe I think it depends on the delivery person. I had tried to exchange my redmi note 5 pro (has minor dents) delivery guy flat out rejected lol. I had exchanged pretty beat up Realme X with some scratches in bottom left of my screen (dropped and slid in tar road) and many body dents. This guy only reduced 300 as I didn't have original packaging. So I got pretty much 9700 for my 3 year old phone which I got for 14k Similar Experience with it, it just straight up canceled my order after delaying it for a week for the expected delivery date. Its mostly the assholes coming for exchange. These guys suddenly become steve jobs and start doing QC. I canceled the order when he quoted a price thats half of what Flipkart mentioned. Might as well keep it as a backup phone than letting these assholes profit off it. I had the same experience..I wanted to exchange my laptop for an new one, but when the guy came..he found a dent on the top of the laptop (near the hp logo..It's a 5 yr old laptop) and straight away slashed 4500 from the 8800 exchange value. A big company doesn't think like a small shopkeeper. Flipkart doesn't care about customers. It just does what it wants to do. Amazon on the other hand is customer centric. My wife has same opinion, she said that he can't ask directly as that's why trying to find fault so that I can tip him some cash. Moto is shit anyway and their non existent 3rd party service centers are even shittier I exchanged my android for iPhone from FK. In my case the delivery person was really nice. He was polite and very patient while I transferred the last bit of data to the iphone. Although the side of the phone had a small but visible crack, and i was afraid the exchange value will go down because of this, he didn’t report it and i got the full 7.5k for it. Maybe you just got unlucky. Hello, I had a question regarding exchange and I'm not able to DM you. So can you please DM me"
