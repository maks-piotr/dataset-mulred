What was supposed to be a simple valve replacement ended up with multiple open heart surgery and a peripheral angioplasty, putting my mother on the ventilator eventually leading to her demise. \n\nWe were there in the hospital day and night for 15 days, completely believing the doctor's words that she will do well. How come a faulty valve was placed in the heart and yet the leak was not discovered till 6 days later. We gave all consents with our faith in them. Yet, it led to this.\n\nMy mother fought many battles in her life and there was none she backed off. It is not the case where my mother was weak on the hospital bed and lost her life, she fought her best. Soon we will find out who wronged her. \n\nWe don’t want this to ever happen to any other person or family.\n\nLink to the article: https://www.mid-day.com/mumbai/mumbai-news/article/hospitals-negligence-killed-my-wife-23293865",

At least for 6 days.\n\nInitially there was no leak.The doctors did good post op check up, that's why they were able to detect the leak later on, and did the second surgery. If the doctors had not done proper post op monitoring, the person would have died before the second surgery.\n\nDo you even have any iota of idea how valves function? It can initially function normally, later can break due to various reasons.\n\nTypically if the quality of value is good, it should not break in years. If it breaks in days it is entirely the fault of the manufacturer. There is no facility to stress the valves in hospital. It is no fault of the doctor.\n\nDoctors can only check the parameters (typically echo) from your body and if that's normal infer that the valve must have been functioning normally. If the parameters are mildly abnormal it is very difficult to ascertain if it is due to the human body's poor adaptation to the valve or any problem with the valve. The parameters must be hugely abnormal to pinpoint the reason as a faulty valve. Hence the delay.\n\nAlso even if the valve is found to be faulty, you cannot take the patient to a second surgery who had just had a major surgery. It needs preparation. \n\nYou act as simps of corporates and doctors become an easy scapegoat for you. Don't blame doctors when it is not their fault. \n\nDon't call the doctors useless, just because you cannot read the article properly and you want to lick the boots of corporates.",

While this is not a time for this but please please get in touch with a lawyer and go full guns blazing against this hospital and the company who manufactured the valve. If possible then do share the valve manufacturer's name? Unfortunately the hospital safeguards itself from all this with all the consents that we sign but you can still hold the valve company responsible.

Where symptoms popped up- repeated evaluation, and ECHO- had significant sudden onset valve leak.\nBtw I'm in medical field. I get posted in ICUs and I do see CTVS surgeons call in cardiologists for echo immediately post op and how everything goes.\nSignificant valve leak is pretty easy for a cardiologist to identify, they use colour Doppler for flow pathway, and it popps up if leak is present.\nHere, it's kinda obvious that immediate post op was uneventful and it was valve defect that succumbed to changing hemodynamics of the body post op.",

But equally, in any medical facility this defect should have been detected within 144 hours of surgery.\n\nMistakes happen. I am not assigning absolute blame, but assigning full blame to the manufacturer is not right (I have no connection to the medical appliance industry), but on the balance of probabilities, this may be a case where the overworked medical specialists also missed something.

        "I'm from Delhi and have experience with the \"top\" three private hospitals of Delhi. I can say with confidence that they will murder a patient for money. Yes they will force like changing or life endangering unnecessary and unwanted surgeries on patients. The first one happened with my grandmother at Max Hospital in Saket, she had low salt in her body due to medication she took causing cramps, I was 17 at the time my parents were abroad. We didn't know at the time that she had low salt. I took her to max for OPD, they took her to emergency, realised that the cramps are due to low salt levels, hid that information from me, did not give her food or tea for 10 hours as they realised that giving her salt would realive the cramps, did several tests, tried to convince a 17 year old me that there is a problem in her kidneys and she needs to be urgently operated. Out of desperation I had to get her admitted in the hospital, when I went to admit her they said that all rooms are full and only the presidential suite is available,.after admitting her I found out that the entire hospital was empty. \n\nHad similar experiences in Moolchand hospital, where during a routine checkup in OPD, the doctors forced her to be admitted and then forced a biopsy, at that time we thought the biopsy was genuine, but later on found out that the doctors wife was the oncologist who did the biopsy. Later other doctors confirmed that there was no need for such an operation.\n\nThe third time I went for a hair transplant, the doctor defrauded me by saying he will transplant 4200 grafts but implanted just 1500, and took 1.5 Lakhs. Worst of all he implanted in such a manner that it looks very unnatural.\n\nEven some small private doctors and clinics are the same (not all though, a small minority of doctors are gems who truly serve humanity).",

I am not anti doctor, despite your failed attempts to prove otherwise. \n\nThe manufacturer was at fault, the overworked medical staff missed something. I wasn't trying to demonise. I simply said that it should have been detected within the 144 hours post-op. \n\nI wasn't try to attack you, though I got a bit emotional and over the top, and for that I apologise, let's leave it there?",

Hospital had valve i stock at their store. They used it. You pay for service (care). I genuinely doubt if valve was faulty.

Do you see customer going after battery company?  It's hospital responsibility. They get signed all documents to avoid legal issues. \n\nIf tomorrow brand new ventilator stops working which was assigned to patient and he dies. Whom will patient's family blame? ventilator company or hospital? Hospital can't say they provided faulty ventilator. It worked fine and cleared all safety checks.  You don't seem to consider other side.",
        "See ...there's no point if you're gonna be biased about this. I agree big hospitals can be dicks sometimes. But that doesn't mean their existence is bad. My main point if you see is : how can a hospital test the valve it receives and still be sterile before it is put into a patient's heart? \n\nThe ola example is flawed my friend. Ola HAS a compulsion to test all batteries they receive and the final product. A hospital CANNOT test sterile equipment because of the risk that it will be infected with the tiny bacteria/virus.  A ventilator is something completely different cause it's outside the body and can be cleaned through various methods. The hospital has a compulsion to check the ventilators it receives.\n\nI hope you understand the above explanation. If not then i guess let's agree to disagree here. Goodbye",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "This is what happened when we completely trusted the healthcare system. We put our faith in the doctors, nurses, staff and the hospital but all of them failed us. What was supposed to be a simple valve replacement ended up with multiple open heart surgery and a peripheral angioplasty, putting my mother on the ventilator eventually leading to her demise. We were there in the hospital day and night for 15 days, completely believing the doctor's words that she will do well. How come a faulty valve was placed in the heart and yet the leak was not discovered till 6 days later. We gave all consents with our faith in them. Yet, it led to this. My mother fought many battles in her life and there was none she backed off. It is not the case where my mother was weak on the hospital bed and lost her life, she fought her best. Soon we will find out who wronged her. We don’t want this to ever happen to any other person or family. Link to the article:",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "The company who made the valve A lot of doctors are paid seat docs whose single aim is to recoup the money spent in getting their degree. It's time for a public registry of docs and their degrees. I am really sorry for your loss. 🫂 Be prepared for our justice system. It stinks, big time. Just don't hold Doctors responsible...how can we when all doctors are ONLY selected through merit and not a single seat is given via management, no one pays lakhs or even crores to get admission... Can we really blame the doctors though no medical treatment boasts a complete success rate. If you even have a sense of idea about neet counseling procedure i suppose you would have refrained from your sentece as to blame all doctors on basis of college the studied in. So sorry for what happened to your mom. Please post this on Twitter and tag the health minister. Atleast the valve manufacturers or hospital must be made accountable... It's a sorry state of healthcare in our country... the system is such that ..Our health and well being rests in our hands only . How is the hospital responsible for the manufacturer carelessly shipping a faulty equipment? Its not like valves can be pre tested. Reading this feels like they haven't seen a faulty valve before so they didn't know what was going wrong post surgery. And by the time they knew, it was too late. Paid seats doesn't mean the college needs to give them degrees. >And by the time they knew, it was too late. I think thats what OP is saying. What were healthcare system doing not monitoring if its actually working or it was faulty Because you actually don't pre test a valve before surgery in a hospital. That's the job of the manufacturer. No one is saying pre test. Post op monitoring should be there Faulty Valve is doctors mistake?? Are u brain dead? The doctors job is to check up the patients and provide treatment. Faulty machinery is entirely the fault of the hospital. If u have to blame doctors.Blame those who enter govt colleges after scoring 350 marks.(not naming them here) Link is not working :( If there was no post op monitoring, they would not have suspected an infection and finally a second surgery. Detecting a faulty valve is not difficult. And any competent doctor should have picked it up post-op. Really dumb sentence. You should do more research regarding NEET PG/SS and INI exams before making such statements. And there is a public registry of docs/their degrees. There is also a registry on continued medical education, where docs attend mandatory seminars/conferences to stay updated. And where put up their publications. > public registry of docs/their degrees Link? Email State medical council. Every state has a huge registry of all docs when and how each and every doctor got their degree. > Detecting a faulty valve is not difficult. Is it so? > any competent doctor should have picked it up post-op There you go! It can be picked up only as \"Post-OP\" Yes, and the useless doctors took six days. Mine was checked every six hours for two days post-op. I thought you meant public registry. If you spent a couple of crores getting a degree, my assumption is that you would want it back ASAP. Hence my statement. Its linked to Aadhar/has clinic address and stuff... I don't think can be made public. I'm not sure. RTI or something should help you, a lawyer would know better. Then it isn't public. But it can be accessed when you have a complaint/issue with hospital/doctor. State medical council is the one where if negligence is proven in court, they cancel all degrees and close the establishment in their registry. Did you even read the article? They did a post op check up. At least for 6 days. Initially there was no leak.The doctors did good post op check up, that's why they were able to detect the leak later on, and did the second surgery. If the doctors had not done proper post op monitoring, the person would have died before the second surgery. Do you even have any iota of idea how valves function? It can initially function normally, later can break due to various reasons. Typically if the quality of value is good, it should not break in years. If it breaks in days it is entirely the fault of the manufacturer. There is no facility to stress the valves in hospital. It is no fault of the doctor. Doctors can only check the parameters (typically echo) from your body and if that's normal infer that the valve must have been functioning normally. If the parameters are mildly abnormal it is very difficult to ascertain if it is due to the human body's poor adaptation to the valve or any problem with the valve. The parameters must be hugely abnormal to pinpoint the reason as a faulty valve. Hence the delay. Also even if the valve is found to be faulty, you cannot take the patient to a second surgery who had just had a major surgery. It needs preparation. You act as simps of corporates and doctors become an easy scapegoat for you. Don't blame doctors when it is not their fault. Don't call the doctors useless, just because you cannot read the article properly and you want to lick the boots of corporates. Pure unadulterated bullshit. You are talking through your backside. The doctors are just covering their arses. Don't be an apologist for utterly sub standard care. I read the article, you didn't understand the article. FFS. How was she transferred to the wards from ICU, if the valves has been faulty from the beginning Lick the boots harder I expected an inarticulate reply, but yours disappointed even me. Your pseudo understanding of things medical. An \"echo\" for checking? Do you live in the 70s. Please don't reply, you're only humiliating yourself. Call it a day buddy. Oh, so they don't use echos in 2023? What is the new tech now? Need more mental gymnastics to spew your blind hatred on doctors! Please don't ramble further. Our cardiac doc's are pissing themselves reading your replies. Goodnight, and good luck blaming \"others\". Typical. Good doctors detect shit products. Sorry for your loss op. That looks like an aortic valve, mine was also replaced. While this is not a time for this but please please get in touch with a lawyer and go full guns blazing against this hospital and the company who manufactured the valve. If possible then do share the valve manufacturer's name? Unfortunately the hospital safeguards itself from all this with all the consents that we sign but you can still hold the valve company responsible. Though I am pretty sure that it is the hospital's fault and even if it's not then there is no way to prove whose fault it is until and unless the hospital gives in writing, which they never will. BC pathetic state of affairs of our health system. I asked two questions? 1) How was the patient shifted to wards if the valves are faulty from the beginning? 2) What is the new tech in 2023 if not echo? (Apparently I have pseudo understanding of medicine and you know better) You don't have an answer for this, yet call me bullshit? Now my third question? 3) What technology \"Good\" doctors use to detect shit products? I want answers, not your nonsense. If you don't have answers, just accept all that you have is blind hatred for doctors. Once you get to ad hominem jibes, you've run out of ideas. Goodnight. There is a public state wise registry. If you enter the doctor's registration number, you can get his degree, additional degree validity of licence, his practice, etc.. It has few other details linked like aadhaar, CME points, address, marks in exams, personal details, etc... Which you cannot see due to privacy reasons Links for a few states For other states, Google \" ______ state medical council doctor search\" There is also a national level register, but is not upto date and has doctors who registered till 2020 I didn't do any personal attack. I just asked questions from your statement. If you have proper answer, I'm ready to apologise. You have an answer or what? It seems to be the manufacturer's fault. What!? ECHO is still the investigation of choice/preferred investigation for post op monitoring. What other tech are you using? Please elaborate and provide valid source. (Proper CVOT/landmark trials or reference book accepted by AHA or ESC) Lmao. People have no idea how much mortality rate these surgeries have. Read journals and cardiology books you will get answer whom to blame. Fucking hell illiterate journalist. Pre-OP you are not allowed handle the implant. You put into the heart and check the functioning post op. I hope you are not in the field of science. He doesn't. He's an anti medic troll. I hope you can read. I hope you aren't in the medical field. No one mentioned handling pre-op. They didn't detect the problem for six days post-op. Woww... They did do echo post op, it was normal. After post op care she was shifted to wards. Where symptoms popped up- repeated evaluation, and ECHO- had significant sudden onset valve leak. Btw I'm in medical field. I get posted in ICUs and I do see CTVS surgeons call in cardiologists for echo immediately post op and how everything goes. Significant valve leak is pretty easy for a cardiologist to identify, they use colour Doppler for flow pathway, and it popps up if leak is present. Here, it's kinda obvious that immediate post op was uneventful and it was valve defect that succumbed to changing hemodynamics of the body post op. Congratulations on your qualifications. It is obvious that the valve was faulty and the manufacturer should have accountability. But equally, in any medical facility this defect should have been detected within 144 hours of surgery. Mistakes happen. I am not assigning absolute blame, but assigning full blame to the manufacturer is not right (I have no connection to the medical appliance industry), but on the balance of probabilities, this may be a case where the overworked medical specialists also missed something. I'm not trying to demonise the doctors. We're all human, with the foibles that brings. First of all my condolences to the family. Now from what i have seen in web series and movies (like Dr. House, chicago med, The good doctor), this is not the doctor/staff fault it's the company/manufacturers fault for providing a faulty valve so even if you file a case against the hospital/ doctor nothing is going to happen. The company providing the valve should be held accountable This is the answer. what a insensitive comment His mom died and you are laughing. Have some shame Facts are insensitive now? that's what these multi speciality hospitals want you to believe. They will always have excuse when they fuck up. There is good chance, hospital is lying to cover their ass. If you buy ola bike and suddenly bike catches fire while you were driving and you are 50 burnt. Whom will you blame? Will it be okay if Ola says battery caught fire and battery provider is responsible and not ola ? Ola outsourced their battery to third party provider. Due to faulty battery, it caught fire I'm from Delhi and have experience with the \"top\" three private hospitals of Delhi. I can say with confidence that they will murder a patient for money. Yes they will force like changing or life endangering unnecessary and unwanted surgeries on patients. The first one happened with my grandmother at Max Hospital in Saket, she had low salt in her body due to medication she took causing cramps, I was 17 at the time my parents were abroad. We didn't know at the time that she had low salt. I took her to max for OPD, they took her to emergency, realised that the cramps are due to low salt levels, hid that information from me, did not give her food or tea for 10 hours as they realised that giving her salt would realive the cramps, did several tests, tried to convince a 17 year old me that there is a problem in her kidneys and she needs to be urgently operated. Out of desperation I had to get her admitted in the hospital, when I went to admit her they said that all rooms are full and only the presidential suite is available,.after admitting her I found out that the entire hospital was empty. Had similar experiences in Moolchand hospital, where during a routine checkup in OPD, the doctors forced her to be admitted and then forced a biopsy, at that time we thought the biopsy was genuine, but later on found out that the doctors wife was the oncologist who did the biopsy. Later other doctors confirmed that there was no need for such an operation. The third time I went for a hair transplant, the doctor defrauded me by saying he will transplant 4200 grafts but implanted just 1500, and took 1.5 Lakhs. Worst of all he implanted in such a manner that it looks very unnatural. Even some small private doctors and clinics are the same (not all though, a small minority of doctors are gems who truly serve humanity). Admission is nothing though , training makes or breaks a doctor not physics and chem Man wants to pray away the heart disease If you can spend crores you don't need to get it back , spending 6 year continuously giving neet is less expensive so it isn't really something i would assume someone who isn't rich would do \"you want to lick the boots of corporate\" \"lick the boots harder\" \"spew your blind hatred\" Just a few examples as you said of \"I didn't attack you\". You must feel a bit silly about this as these were taken from your posts. And to make the point for the third time. I am not anti doctor, despite your failed attempts to prove otherwise. The manufacturer was at fault, the overworked medical staff missed something. I wasn't trying to demonise. I simply said that it should have been detected within the 144 hours post-op. I wasn't try to attack you, though I got a bit emotional and over the top, and for that I apologise, let's leave it there? An anti medic medic. Nice try.... I'm still awaiting your considered response. My apologies, I didn't realise you were an expert on aftershave lotions. Heaven forfend a man be invested in skincare eh? Go on, keep digging through my profile. I'm sure you'll find something else too? I also like Bridgerton you know? Huge fan of the witcher and horizon too. Sorry, there is always a chance of human error. You are right, doctors may be at fault but i feel bad when they are outright targeted without even considering other major factors that have a higher probability. In your example here, the product is made by OLA. here's a better one : you buy the Vehicle from OLA but now you sue the management at the OLA showroom cause they sold you the vehicle and did the paperwork for you so that you could use the product made by OLA. Sue the people who made the product, not the people who helped you use the product. Product - Valve. Helper - doctor. You- the retard who is planning to sue the management Edit : Typo I'm sorry if sounded so accusing. I didn't want to offend. The bottom line is that there was a very sad outcome for the family. Multiple factors at play. But I was attacked fairly viciously and I overreacted. Good evening. Sorry. Apologies. I've been attacked as anti med all through this convo. I've overreacted. No excuse really, but I do have a great deal of experience in cardiac issues. Sorry Hey sorry man, my bad.... Looking back my comments did come off attacking. Yeah, I hope the family gets justice and the closure they need. I apologise again, thank you for being nice. I don't think you have any knowledge about Ola at all. Most of Ola bike parts are outsourced to third party. They assemble it and sell it. That's why there is accountability issue despite so many fire catching incident. This is real fact, not hypothetical assumption. Google it. Doctor doesn't send patient anywhere to buy anything. Hospital had valve i stock at their store. They used it. You pay for service (care). I genuinely doubt if valve was faulty. It's entirely possible it's just excuse by hospital to cover up their mistake. In second scenario, even if it's faulty, doctors are supposed to check it. You are telling me to sue Ola management for fire while you don't want to blame hospital for fuck up. Crazy dude 👍 ❤️ You were the one who started with baseless offends like \"Useless\" \"incompetent\" doctors, so I had to use these. You did not once say, the manufacturer is at fault. You straight up called doctors \"useless\", \"incompetent\", \"unknowledged\", \"poor understanding of medicine\". Is this not corporate boot licking. These are not personal attacks, it was me getting response over YOUR BASELESS ACCUSATIONS. I said those if you cannot answer my question, you are spewing blind hatred. It's apparent. It is not a personal attack. Personal attack means saying something about your job, family, caste, or thing which you did not say etc.. \"POINTING OUT\" your hatred on doctors and bootlicking of corporates is not personal attack. I also said, I'll apologise if you have a proper answer. > the overworked medical staff missed something. My 4th question, is there any proof for this statement? > Your failed attempts to prove otherwise. My failed attempt? Do you have a proper answer for at least one of my questions instead of playing the victim card? I apologised. You're still carrying on. You haven't posited a single cogent response. I'm sorry you are so upset and keep repeating yourself. Try to calm yourself down. Have a peaceful evening. Le Modi ji: isme bhi nehru ki galti he And actually check your posts against \"ad hominem\". Using all caps like Donald Trump. Doesn't really make things true🙄 Sorry i didn't know you could take the valve for a test drive and if you didn't like it you could get your money back. Are you anywhere in the realm of biotechnology or Masters in Surgery? (OLA being an example here. I thought your thick skull would've gotten the sarcasm) How do you subject the mitral valve in a heart like environment while also keeping it sterile before the operation???? The company is supposed to do that I don't care about your bias against the doctors or your bootlicking the corporation. Just sit with what you're thinking and then type. Last point. Ik you have weak comprehensive skills. Read my comment again. I am telling you to sue OLA. NOT THE MANAGEMENT You apologised, but in the same comment you accused me of Personal attack which I didn't do. Also you added YOUR BASELESS ACCUSATION of doctors missing something > You haven't posited a single cogent response. Now too you are accusing me by playing the victim card, when you have not answered my single question. > Try to calm yourself down. You continue to spew hatred and I should calm down as if it is no fault of yours? You see, this is a personal attack. Searching the previous history and spitting some nonsense irrelevant to the topic Where does Donald Trump come into this? All caps are to point your nonsense. Why are deviationing from the topic in every comment? Do you have answers for my questions? >Unfortunately the hospital safeguards itself from all this with all the consents that we sign but you can still hold the valve company responsible. That doesn't mean if they fuck up they can't be sued. The waivers will be terminated if it was the hospital staff who was being careless or used unsafe devices. This is ad hominem. Instead of answering my question, you start talking about CAPS which is irrelevant to the discussion. Problem is you're going full bore on the medical negligence claim when you really don't have a ton to go on. If you are a medic then you have to know that medical care isn't as certain as people think. And that laypeople just don't appreciate that things can go wrong. They insist that someone must be to blame when often it just doesn't boil down to conscious negligence. Especially when it comes to medical parts failing where any number of things can go wrong. I'm not personally ruling out negligence, but the fact that you're fully assuming medical bad faith, suggests strong bias issues. Please, calm down, this is a forum for expressing opinions, you seem to be very invested in only your feelings. And stop us using \"spew\". At least consult a thesaurus. I was enjoying the banter. Nothing online is worth your feelings of outrage. I hope you feel better soon buddy, and I am not being facetious. I've just been having an enjoyable exchange of smart arse comments , with a few mild insults thrown in. But you..... If you know a great deal about cardiac issues, why can't you answer my question? Or you are just a self styled expert? And to help. There is no such word as \"deviationing\". The Donald is renowned for over-exaggeration using all caps. Again talking irrelevant to the discussion. I am not in a literary competition to find new words to describe your SPEWing of hatred. If you are only expressing your opinion, I'm too. Okay, do you have an answer for my question, or again you are going to SPEW some nonsense. If you look at my other comments I said (paraphrased) \"obviously the manufacturer was at fault, but the problem should have been picked up before 6 days elapsed\". Wasn't trying a full dump on the doc's. >The third time I went for a hair transplant, the doctor defrauded me by saying he will transplant 4200 grafts but implanted just 1500, and took 1.5 Lakhs. Worst of all he implanted in such a manner that it looks very unnatural. I've read plenty of stories just like yours about this. Is there an option to sue the doctor because of that? I didn't claim to be an expert in grammar and vocabulary. What does Donald's habit have to do with my comments? I'm not exaggerating anything, unlike you who claim to know a lot about cardiac issues. I am just asking answers for my 4 questions. You really are angry aren't you. Seek a little help mate. Goodnight. Sorry our discussion upset you. And you have to know that while that might be the case, it's also not always feasible. Not only can things get reasonably missed, but not everything necessarily shows up on monitoring either. And that's not even getting into the specific stressors that might be at play in this hospital. Yes, you made me angry. It is up to me to seek help or not. Now Do you have an answer for my questions? Yours is not discussion, but a pure hatred. So you don't have answers for my questions. OK. No personal attacks again. I have no hatred. Please calm down. If you accuse someone, are confident that they did wrong without having any proof, and say they are useless, incompetent, unknowledged that's hatred. If you have no hatred, where are the answers for my questions? Oh I certainly do, but why waste my time, you will only reply with further insults and invective. Please seek help with you anger issues. Goodluck asking them to give you proofs that will prove that it was their fault. Absolutely agree. are you retarded by some chance? Goodnight. Sleep well. Please don't worry. If you have a proper answer I said I'll apologise for everything. You cannot give answers, because you don't have any. If you had any, who would have already given that, instead of pointing to my grammar and vocabulary mistakes. > you will only reply with further insults and invective. You were the one who started insults with words like \"useless\" \"incompetent\", but now playing the victim card. > Please seek help with you anger issues. You seek help with your hatred issues Don't get consumed in hatred. Hatred will destroy you and people around you. Thank you, I won't. Hope we can chat on a different topic some time. Cricket? Red wine? I think we got off on the wrong foot tonight, and I think we're both a bit stubborn, I know I am. If you believe the hospitals story. Basically a thorough investigation to find the cause for valve dysfunction- a faulty valve/ a thrombus or vegetation leading to stuck valve leaflet/ a patient prosthesis mismatch whatever the cause. A redo valve replacement has twice the mortality and morbidity especially so soon after the primary procedure. So prognosis is always guarded with redo procedures. Very sorry for OPs loss but getting the proper facts out can be difficult. I would have gladly apologise if I am at wrong. No, in this case, I'm not wrong. You are. I will be stubborn if I'm right, be it cricket, red wine or medicine. At least you acknowledged you were on the wrong foot. Let's end here. OK. Cheers Just about to finish a glassor three of red wine 🍷. I tonight I recognised your user name. I read your post yesterday about your ER experience. I can't imagine the stress. It doesn't matter about our current argument, but I hope you don't think I was absolutely out of line. At least I know where you're coming from. Did he laugh at the mom?He laughed at the “illiterate journalist” So, the journalist should not be held responsible because his mom died? Don’t show cloying sympathy. Yes. Apparently he has botched many people. We are all discussing on taking joint legal action. I am comparing valve with bike battery. and If bike catches fire, I would helf showroom responsible for giving me faulty product along with ola. Are you doctor? You seem to got butthurt considering amount of personal attack you made in your couple of comments. I am not bootlicking (valve company) corporation. Patient can't go after valve company. Patient died because of hospital negligence. Hospital is responsible for it. Saying It was faulty valve is not excuse, hospitals involving in mal practice is really common. > Lmao. **People** have no idea how much mortality rate these surgeries have. He laughed at OP for blaming hospital I don’t think you should comment if your source is TV dramas. Yes I am in the medical field pursuing MBBS thus having a thorough knowledge in the field. Maybe you can drop your credentials if they are related to the topic. I would love to know. The personal attacks are on your intelligence regarding your comments. Nothing more. Welcome to reddit my friend Even if i wasn't in the field, we have a messed up doctor to patient ratio in India (1:800). Any reason why it's easier to go after hospital than valve company ? Just because it has happened in the past. Doesn't confirm it happens every time. Does it? Agar hai toh proof bataiye? The faulty valve isn't an excuse, it's an explanation. PS. You still haven't answered all my questions in the previous comment Sorry for your loss OP. One my relatives despite having substantial monetary resources , faced similar issues. They took the hospital/doctors to court . Its has been 15 years since , the case is still on going. In India getting good medical treatment is a matter of luck ,especially if you have complications. I am engineer. I am not from medical field. I have bias against doctors because of personal experience. Go through thread, you will find similar comments from people who had first hand experience dealing with super speciality hospitals. You literally have target to achieve for surgeries and tests even if it comes at cost of patient lives. I have even seen ayush doctor in icu because hospitals want to save money. How did he supposed to go after valve company? It's hospital responsibility. I gave you ola bike example. My bike catches fire, I would blame showroom and ola company for giving me faulty product. Ola can't refuse fuck up and say battery provider is responsible since fire is due to battery. Do you see customer going after battery company? It's hospital responsibility. They get signed all documents to avoid legal issues. If tomorrow brand new ventilator stops working which was assigned to patient and he dies. Whom will patient's family blame? ventilator company or hospital? Hospital can't say they provided faulty ventilator. It worked fine and cleared all safety checks. You don't seem to consider other side. See ...there's no point if you're gonna be biased about this. I agree big hospitals can be dicks sometimes. But that doesn't mean their existence is bad. My main point if you see is : how can a hospital test the valve it receives and still be sterile before it is put into a patient's heart? The ola example is flawed my friend. Ola HAS a compulsion to test all batteries they receive and the final product. A hospital CANNOT test sterile equipment because of the risk that it will be infected with the tiny bacteria/virus. A ventilator is something completely different cause it's outside the body and can be cleaned through various methods. The hospital has a compulsion to check the ventilators it receives. I hope you understand the above explanation. If not then i guess let's agree to disagree here. Goodbye They must pay Did he reply what is the alternate to 2d echo . I am forwarding this to all the night duty staff and we are all trying to guess what it is. The surgeons are not here so can't update. But cardiac MRI is another option although my senior says 2d echo is the go to. Please let us know. Also so sorry OP but I hope you get justice and aren't just doing it for false things. Your anger is misguided though. Also I have commented elsewhere as well and we all doctors agree that the cardiac surgeon shouldnr have said Everything will be alright . We are taught to speak in facts and stats. His only fault right now it seems is this. Also OP keep us updated. I hope you get justice. As you sow so shall you reap. You have really distressed this guy. Lol he seems furious and ate more than can digest. Good for you internet warrior Lol It was all fun for me > We put our faith in the doctors, nurses, staff and the hospital but all of them failed us. What was supposed to be a simple valve replacement It’s LITERALLY heart surgery. People expect 100% success rates. Go put your fate in someone else. Leave us in peace. But atleast people who read your answers if even one reads your answers might learn the right things and not believe his \" since I have cardiac problems, I am a cardiac doctor now \" analogy ! Simple valve replacement. Lol. Pt expectations are at an all time high right now. Thank you for the agricultural advice. Completely irrelevant here, but it it makes you feel clever... Absolutely Mudi 🤡🤡 It does tbh ! I had fun seeing you face reality! A lesson to speak what you know. Just because it's anonymous doesn't mean you will get away with everything I'm glad I brought a bit of sunshine into your little life. Keep well. The Blackwater Bay guy is far too dumb and biased. Just let it be. He/she will never understand. Modi ji"
