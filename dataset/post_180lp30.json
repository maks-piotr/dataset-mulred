They cannot deprive independence just because they are unable to solve the issue of women security. seeing all this really motivates me to start preparing for usmle Nobody is depriving anybody of anything. But if somebody is eve teasing or trying to, shouldn't they be taught a lesson and shouldn't there be police nearby for easy and fast access? Most people in the country are uneducated and uncivilized and actually like and want such schemes. Political parties are not morons, they invest a ton of money in research and analysis in order to identify what the public likes and wants and only then make promises Why can't we have anti eveteasing/anti rapist squad instead. Scalp those fuckers I don't care, why harrass couples Funny how freebies are mentioned first and employment creation for youth the last. BJP on child safety, rape and women harassment - what can we do? This happens everywhere. BJP on consensual relationships - we will do everything to stop it. what happened to freedom of speech and expression??? Police , not an uncontrolled unregulated semi legal force. Instead of making Anti Romeo squad and harassing couples who are in a relationship consensually why not focus on creating a squad who will keep an eye on people who eve teases and harass girls. Party ke lok ko khud pitenge kya!? Why not create schools with better teaching and curriculum? Isn't that for eve teasing? >Committed to making Rajasthan a 350 billion dollar economy in the next 5 years Lolol bj party sure likes to throw fancy big numbers 🤣 The population of non-20 year olds exceeds 20 year olds! So, the majority can oppress the minority! Thats the logic! If no talking, then no eve teasing bro.... This is unethical as they don't want any interaction between youth of different genders. Meanwhile, these morons have the guts to meet women and openly commit shit that would land them in jail if they hadn't been in power. For the sake of women's safety, this party shouldn't be elected in Rajasthan. Democracy is dead on a lighter note. What we're seeing is just paper democracy. It's a proper kakistocracy by now. Literally the worst of society being garlanded, lionized and given election tickets. We already have a nirbhaya squad for the exact same thing. They are pretty much active too. In simpler words, a banana republic. We already have Nirbhaya Squad here. Not sure how active they are. Read a news article some time back that they have caught Eve teasers at a mall sometime back. The scary thing is congress brining the old pension scheme. We will be in financial ruins in next 15-20 years, the type of ruin never seen before. Democracy gave us this. India has a lot of democracy but we have very little liberalism. Essentially India is a very good communitarian democracy but it's a terrible liberal democracy This is very much democracy. Majority of Indians want this BS. This issue is not democracy but liberalism. India is not a liberal democracy like Western countries, we are a communitarian democracy. All parties here are freebie merchants. No one cares about financial prudence. A lot of freebies. How are BJP any different from Congress here. They're do the same freebie nonsense with an added layer of social conservativism Jesus a lot freebies. South Indian states are going to end up paying for all these. So many freebies in this image. South Indian states are going to end up paying for all these. Nobody cares about financial prudence over here it seems. We are kicking the public debt burden down the road to next generation. Good thing tho Translation anyone? Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Yogna? Also BJP - Cover the women because we cannot control ourselves Who are your voters? Those consenting couples take election day as a holiday and don't go anywhere near the booth to vote. I'm not commenting if this is right or wrong, but clearly it's going to be effective. Those who vote, consider these as safeguards against eve teasing too. No political party is an ethical charity. They are here to win and like any other sales / marketing guy, they will do market study and pitch what works. BJP cried about the Congress government offering freebies in Karnataka - Shakthi scheme. Yet, their menifesto here is full of them. If I googled correct you are talking about US Meds. Honestly US recently has become a bit dangerous and extremely racist towards Indian , don’t you think? More scarier than every fucking party promising caste based survey and reservation increase? maryada purushottam rajya in kartavya kaal Also BJP - Garland these rapists please oh that sounds like an excerpt from Quran.. lol exactly! lol Let me ask you. Why do you think educated politicians shouldn't be running for their posts? It has been shown that democracy improves with the increased literacy of the person ruling over people. Our forefathers had proposed this idea but some power hungry fools wanted to play with our future hence the current system of governance. We are lucky that being surrounded by highly undemocratic countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Afghanistan we have yet remained strong in our constitutional values but the future seems bleak. As pointed out by one guy it's just kakistocracy and nothing else. The reason they won in UP was freebies >50 lakh people Anti-Romeo BD squad Obviously love is western propoganda. Kultcha folevr Rewards are very high for being a doctor in the US. Just have to buy a gun to protect yourself. In India, you can be a highly paid executive for Apple and still get shot dead by some UP police constable and nothing will happen. Or you can be a software engineer and get killed in some communal riot. Civil war 2.0 Eve teasing is very far from a consensual relationship between two adults. Also anti-romeo gangs sound very different from a responsible and law-abiding police officer. Thats the motive Anti-Romeo only...to stop harrasment and eve teasing. They clearly used wrong wordings. The term Romeo doesn't mean romantic in rural areas, it means boys who chase girls. Anti Romeo squads are for women safety outside their offices and colleges, it was implemented in UP and it has been effective in reducing street harassment in general over the years, it has nothing to do with privacy. Also BJP- Muslim women should not cover their heads because we don't like it. Not a matter of your concern cause no girl would like to be around someone like you at all I in no way meant India is better. I just means there are much better options now like Europe and the Nordics. More like BJP on rape - Why would we stop our favourite hobby. You can't get as rich as a doctor anywhere other than US, I think. Health care system designed to extract as much money from patients as possible. So if the people want it, why is Reddit shitting on it? Do Redditors think the people don’t deserve what they want? Because it is problematic and gets abused on innocents. Majority people wanting it doesn't make it non-problematic. Brij Bhushan Singh Khattar haryana govt Ram rahim sexuals \"Yogi\" Adityanath rape Muslim women Sorryvarkar \"incel prime\" justifying rape as a political tool It's funny how freebies are at top and employment is the last point. Apple executive shot by a cop? Has this happened before? Also being shot is much more likely in the US than in India, don't you think? Income isn't the only parameter of social well-being. I don't know what emotion I'm feeling looking at that, but it's certainly not a voting-for-the-BJP feeling. They should have highlighted the women police stations but instead \"anti Romeo squad is highlighted\". They know what people want Don't worry. I'll be joining the Anti Romeo Squad to hunt the likes of you. What is wrong with it. You misunderstood me. I'm saying US health system is not designed to maximize social well-being. Because they are capitalist society, it's designed to extract profit from sick people. So US doctors can get wealthier than in any other country. Guess who's going to get arranged marriage ❓️ But seriously if you try to get arranged marriage then the girl will run away from the mandap itself after seeing your face for the first time. A girl would happily get honoured killed rather than marrying someone like you Karnataka also has a freebies program Yeah, and they had the cheek to troll other parties with \"Muft ki Rewadi\" jibe when they came up with similar schemes. RSS members are going to get funded through our taxes now Also BJP - against Muslim women and their burkhas \"Recently\" &#x200B; it was like that since like forever. Because politics being open for educated is not democracy. aur future bleak nahi hai bhai halka sa bjp ko bada wala fuk up karne do phir dekhna kya hota hai. wo to logo ko ye party pasand hai to elected hai nahi pasand hoga to hata denge. itna bhi sach nahi bolna tha bhai But whats the problem with freebies? I mean arent they good short term solutions till employment is being generated? >I used samsung gallery translate thingi n it said this. Not sure its correct or not > >Free ration to poor families, no family in the state will remain homeless • PM Kisan Samman Nidhi increased to ₹12,000 Arrangement for purchase of wheat at ₹ 2,700 per quintal and purchase of jowar and millet at MSP. Formation of anti-Romeo squad and women police stations in every district. Will establish Rajasthan Institute of Technology, Rajasthan Institute of Medical Sciences Annual assistance of ₹1,200 to students from poor families Pension of senior citizens and disabled persons increased to ₹ 1,500 per month > >Drinking water to all houses through 24x7 electricity and water life mission. New appointment of 15,000 doctors and 20,000 para medical staff co Free education to all girl students from KG to PG \"Scooties to meritorious girl students who have passed 12th and laptops to students. Skill training to more than 6 lakh rural women. Saving bond of ₹ 2 lakh on the birth of a girl child. BURN 2.5 lakh government jobs for youth. SIT formed for quick investigation of paper leak cases. Compensation policy to provide fair compensation to farmers for auctioned lands under Congress rule. Committed to making Rajasthan a 350 billion dollar economy in the next 5 years. Monthly honorarium of Anganwadi workers will be increased. Employment or self-employment for 50 lakh youth here. posted by u/3inchesOfMayhem Don't worry. Honor Killing is a proud family tradition from where I am. You only need 1-2 good examples to make people understand what's acceptable and what's not. Thankfully, we come from a place where men and women know their place and who they are. Unlike you degenerates. Employment and Self-Employment to 50 lakhs. They will probably just build more statues and temples and the people selling street foods (pakoras) and \"prasad\" and all the beggar outside the temples will be counted as \"self-employed\". Masterstroke! Rajasthan's GDP is already a $200 Bn with a growth rate of more than 11%. If growth rate stays the same, it will be close to $350 bn in the next 5 years anyways. But people who don't understand this, would probably be fooled by such promises. This angers me so much man. Tf a brainless cunt justifying honor killing wasn't something I expected to see on reddit today. Might look scary to you and maybe due to your intentions but voters are voting for this. Take UP example, it was promised and people voted for it Oh forgot about the self employment part. Pakode bechna bhi rozgaar hota hai. I'm not justifying it. It's just a part and parcel of life. Grey area They need to pander to aunties and uncles whose kids are in love with someone from another community. In case of rajasthan kids can mean anything from married toddlers to unmarried 40 year olds. As per my knowledge, Anti Romeo Squad was formed to prevent eve teasing, molestation around the public places such as markets, school and colleges. So what's the issue with this squad, Isn't a good thing to have. Or maybe op is just a manchild who loves to shit on anything related to Bjp. I am not a preacher of bjp but I don't see the issue with the anti Romeo squad. Chalo ye bhi sahi hai bas martial rule na lagade. Kyuki tujhe bhi pata log ek se zyada bhagwan mante he iss party me. WC ke liye term change ho jaye. 😜 So does that mean they would take action against Romeo who harassed Female wrestlers??? retard Mujhe lagta hai knko consensual sex se problem hai freebies other than health and education is useless why no one stop this? Jeez you actually have no life at all, feel sorry for you lmao I searched on youtube and this anti romeo squad means against eve teasing, obviously it wont be implemented but i am pretty sure its not for couples It's more scary if people vote for them after seeing this lol Vote bank Wait what ? Did we switch universes ? lol, Romeo just consumed more poison after reading this. Nahhh! That doesn’t sell. Who cares if a girl gets raped or teased as long as the whole religious morality is followed. - Food security - check - Housing security - check - 5 million jobs - check - Pension - check - More doctors & paramedics - check - Even scooters and laptops for \"good\" students - Plus much more If any Indian government / political party can do this, what is stopping them from doing this right now in every state. Why wait for election? This is the big question. yeah it’s very civilized to murder your own family member because they did something you didn’t like. Full on revdi mode I see. Something they never fail to bring up when talking about kejriwal"
