    "selftext": "Note: A LONG RANT AHEAD....!!!\n\nSo if in case you do not know, these two youtubers travel around the world and make videos and upload it on YouTube. Also, during the last few days, there's a lot of hate hovering around on the internet, especially against us Indians.\nSo these two guys, they both deliberately go to the poorest and filthiest regions of Indian cities, take the worst possible way in the country to travel, meet the most random strangers who are obviously, and surely there to scam others, show it to the whole world, make a hell lot of money out of it, while completely destroying the image of our country.\n\n\nNow, I understand that many Indians will support them saying that India is actually like this, there's no rule, no cleanliness, bad civic sense, and I agree, not every place in India is worthwhile. But what would you say about these guys now, who are again coming back to India, will record the same kind of places again, will upload those shitty videos and will make a huge amount of money too, by showing the ENTIRE COUNTRY in a bad light.\n\nThese guys, especially the bald one, used to make videos praising India, gathered a good amount of Indian viewership, took the white appeasement from us, and is now shitting on the same plate where he once used to eat.\n\nIt's just our white appeasement these guys are sucking us upon. Stop feeding them on our insecurities. Just stop giving them the attention.\n\nI have worked with the so-called white people at my workplace, and I can surely tell you that they're not better than us. They're just humans, just like us Indians. Stop agreeing to whatever shit they're saying. Please just stop doing all these things, stop feeling that we are somewhat inferior to them in any way.\n\n I have a few cousins who have been to abroad, and according to them these kind of places are everywhere, literally everywhere. You can find these same filthy places in cities like Tokyo, New York, London, Moscow, Paris, Shanghai, etc. You name it and that particular place will have a problematic scenario. It's just that these countries or cities are better at hiding it, or even if they aren't hiding it, the bad regions are relatively smaller area wise, so they don't get noticed that much.\n\nAnd regarding these guys, well I have no words. They literally have no shame. In their previous video, one was saying that he won't ever come again to this place (INDIA), literally mentioned \"not again\", and guess what, he's BACK AGAIN. \n\nIf you really didn't want to come again, why to do the same thing deliberately, contradicting your own words. If you question them, their generic answer is always -\n \"This is because India is a very 'BEAUTIFUL' and a 'SPIRITUAL' place, there's something 'MYSTERIOUS' about this place, which 'ATTRACTS' me to get here.\" ü•πü•π\n\nAji LUND MERA....!!! \nCome on guys, even an illiterate person can understand your motives now, you a**holes.\n\nI request you all, please stop watching all those fuckin' REACTION CHANNELS, \"WHAT FOREIGNERS THINK OF INDIA\" kind of videos, \"What foreign girls think about Indian men\" or \"ARE INDIAN GUYS DATABLE\" type of videos. \nPlease stop spamming \"India is great\" or \"Bharat Mata ki Jay\" on every other video on the internet which is nowhere related to India. Please stop. \n\n\nRemember, our respect is only in our hands...!!!",

        "Bald's whole persona is that he is an asshole. He goes to all these poor, dangerous and shitty places all around the world. He has done similar things in the Balkans, Latin America, Eastern Europe and even parts of his own country, the UK.\n\nI don't think people in other countries have been as offended as Indians. Why do we lack such self-esteem that some YouTuber criticising our country makes us lose our shit?",
        "Ignore them,watching their videos even for abusing them generates views and gets them money.\n\nKeep ur emotions in check and ignore them.",
        "Why are you so bothered?",
        "Because whenever I go online, regardless of the platform, I see multiple comments against India. And I have lost my patience now. So I had to post this.",
        "I have lost my patience as well. We are not perfect I am doing by bit to make this place a better country to live. I do love my country but not the corruption due to which we the commoners have to see all of this. Spend your time on something productive buddy :)",

        "This guy came to Germany and made a video about him speaking German. I live in Germany, and speak German and can confidently tell you he pronounced LITERALLY every single word wrongly. I have seen Indians here learning German with better pronounciation than this guy.\n\nAlso feels like he was subtly insulting Germany, with the way he speaks about it(though not as bad as India, because bad white country = still better than \"trash\" \"smelly\" \"rapey\" India).\n\nIt's this guy's MO. Insult a country and get views. Just ignore this clown. For all the stupid people coming with the sole intention of insulting this country, there are also plenty of bloggers who have great videos about India showcasing everything. I'd rather spend my energy giving them the views.",
        "there are lot of people who hate india. Now will you post about everyone of them?",
        "I just took an example here. I Posted this so that people can see the true colour of these people, and stop following them. I have seen Indians literally worship the white skin. I have seen Indians taking selfies with them just because they're foreigners. And these guys are taking advantage of us.\n\nRather than bashing me, your fellow Indian brother, please try to understand my point.",
        "I'm not 100% certain about this but I read somewhere that bald and bankrupt is not only a filthy, sleazy PUA but also exploits tons of underprivileged and trafficked girls found in poorer, 3rd world, or countries with conflict going on. He's been exposed online for taking advantage of young girls, exploiting them and then later bragging about how superior he is to these women. I remember reading about all this a few years back and just his mere mention boils my blood. \n\nI can't believe these shameless, degenerate motherfuckers are coming back to India, just to shit on our culture and doing selective criticism.",
        "I am not bashing you. Like you there are a lot of people, who will get in the trap of these youtubers' intention. Just ignore and move on.",
        "üëç",
        "you know OP you seem like the only one who cares about their opinion, and even if millions of indians watch them who cares , there are still people who watch kangana ranaut movies do you think they all care about her opinions?",
        "Unfortunately a lot of influencers have cracked how to make money from India content. Praise India and thousands of likes and comments will come. Say negative stuff and tens of thousands of comments will come. Either way they make money. \n\nThe right thing to do is completely ignore the content but that's not going to happen.",
        "As a white dude I'm in your side! I liked Mr Bald before when he was more balanced, also a plus for him that he could communicate in hindi with the locals.I think India has made some tremendous growth, people underestimate how hard it is to develop and take what we have in the west for granted",
        "It's not just about self-esteem; silence on these issues only allows problems to fester. Ignoring a problem never leads to a solution. In India, we can handle constructive criticism, but what‚Äôs happening now is pure hate and fear-mongering. If you think I should stay quiet or that I lack self-esteem because I‚Äôm defending my country against disrespect, then I encourage you to reevaluate your perspective.",
        "He does the same to other countries as well but you don't see them raging like this. The more you get offended the more he will like it",
        "bro, everyone shits on everybody. We're not a beacon of anything. When a powerful country like US with its strong R&D, military and tech can get mocked relentlessly by other countries, then what makes us special? \n\nStop taking this personally.",
        "So can't we report them in youtube ?",
        "Exactly I reported both of them but I think so mass report will work",
        "Yes we should",
        "Why?\nthere are train like vande bharat they never travel through this trains why never shows that part of India of course india has its issue but India also have some developments like come on what their problem",
        "The people in those countries do not rage together because they're getting way less hate than us Indians. The kind of comments we get passed on is terrible. You can't even stand that kind of language spoken against India. And the worst part is, it's becoming a norm, to annihilate Indians, because we don't fight back.\n\nAnd it's not particularly about bald only, there are so many creators doing the same.",
        "When 99 percent of country is a shithole  how can i agree that india is developing very fastly  . How is vande bharat a major development in trains rarely one uses it .",
        "Because his videos are catering to a racist audience just go to the comments. Is it that hard to understand? Right now there is kind of a trend to be racist against India, and tour videos like this have became a big part of it.",
        "Why are you publicising them? This is what they thrive on. I had no idea about who they are, and now I am aware. And it the video shows up on my feed, Ill be curious to watch now. Let it go man. Two YouTubers can't do much to change India's reputation - good or bad.",
        "What 'problems' will fester exactly ? Our image ? The GDP growth data from the world bank wont be hidden to anyone. The investors know, and thats what we need.",
        "All the things he said in the video are true tho",
        "First thing not millions of Indians watch them, He actually revealed his audience from India is around 6 %. His videos are catering to a racist audience and you can sense the change in his style of vlogs. And his opinions are kinda fueling the current trend of racism going around for Indians, if you have been living under the rock.",
        "So why don't I see the racial hatred against the Balkans, Latinas, and eastern Europeans? There is a wide spread racism against Indians, to which these YouTubers are adding more fuel.   \nI don't see Africans being called the n-word for Africa being underdeveloped, but Indians are called pajeets for India being not developed.",
        "I used to see him his videos were use to Good but what happened to this bald guy when he come to india that's really a question because he has gone to place far more dangerous then India.",
        "It is literally the engagement of people like you that is driving their viewership. It is so classic rage-bait that it is almost old now.",
        "There are two sides of good and bad and I thinks they depends on only bad side for rage bait and I don't know from which state are you but here in Gujarat I thinks so they are so many developments have happened here so I don't agree with u that India is 99% shit hole we have brts metro train and this transports are not dirty as they shows in their video and we have gift city in gandhinagar which has many foreigner companies so many opportunities and for low class we have AUDA housing scheme and that's why comparing to Mumbai and delhi in here there are very less people who lives on road so yeah that's my point",
        "Because numbers dude. If China had YouTube they‚Äôd probably be rage baited too.",
        "I think you engage with rage bait on a regular basis. I don‚Äôt have this problem.",
        "I don't know why people giving us down votes but if u can then please report this type of videos it's so funny one of them had a title like never visiting india again on first video then proceed to make more two videos on india so this is clearly a rage bait so please report them",
        "Exactly my point bro. I don't know why people here are downvoting your and my comments. Seems like many Indians can't see the fact that hate mongering against India is getting that 'chalta hai' attitude.",
        "I agree with you regarding the publication here. But my actual point is, videos like these, elements like these fuel up the already hate citizens of other nations have against India. I know these two solely can't do anything to damage India's reputation, but they contribute a whole lot to the hate community already present there.\n\nI also went to their comment section. And not just these two on YouTube, there are so many people who bash us for no reason. Just because we usually ignore them or reply as \"yeah, I agree, my country is bad, as an Indian I approve it\". Like what the hell?? At least these people should be defending the country, but they're doing the exact opposite.",
        "But your entire post was about these two people, so my response was in that context.",
        "I'm sorry but you're making assumptions. Just because you don't see something doesn't mean it isn't happening. Being from India, it's obvious that you'll be more exposed to India specific content and hence, you might not be aware of what's happening in other regions.",
        "I think we should ignore these people the more you view the video or comment the more popular so my opinion just report it don't watch by watching we are indirectly giving it engagement to thier channel",
        "Log off? Online is not real world. Most people in the west don't know a lot about or care about India.",
        "Ur emotions are valid. But stay away from social media. It‚Äôs called algorithm. If u keep watching these things, they will show u more of these. My social media doesn‚Äôt show me things against India. Just try to watch positive contents.",
        "Actually I never watch these kinds of videos where any foreigner is explaining his views on India. Neither did I get it on my feed. I came to know about it on reddit itself, but it was getting bigger and was discussed in many subreddits. So I just researched it a little and then I came to know about the hypocrisy of these two guys and the kind of comments they have in their vids against India specifically.\n\nSince I have seen so many racist posts against India already, I just thought that I have to speak up now, because bashing Indians for casual fun is getting out of hand now.",
        "Racism against india is not a new thing. You just discovered it recently. Ur anger and energy is wasted here. Imagine u dont like Germany, u r racist against them, would u stop hating germany because some german posted things like ‚Äúenough of these indian c*nts insulting germans‚Äù on reddit, would u stop hating it? No na? \n\nThe image of India has a lot to do with our global representation. I think the hatred against indians in foreign country is actually declining. It was harsher before.",
        "bald was famous among Indians earlier when he used to talk shit about muslims and islam and shout jai bhole etc on mosque entrance, everyone loved him for that, now he made a video criticising the hygiene issue you all turn against him lol",
        "Let them do what they want. If you don't like them, just don't watch.",
        "See. I do not follow him or watch his videos regularly. I recently came to know about him. And if he's been doing it for so long, why did people like you continue watching him in the first place?? At least you should have pointed it out way before people like me had to do so.",
        ">fueling the current trend of racism going around for Indians, if you have been living under the rock.\n\nand how does that affect you? reactions like OP and yours are why people laugh at indians your feelings get hurt so quickly",
        "The entire world has figured out that triggering or pandering to Indians' need for white approval allows them to exploit a billion strong market.\n\nIf we stop giving an eff, such videos will also stop. \n\nIt's about being mature and not giving two hoots about others racism, biases and negativity. \n\nI don't care if someone makes such videos. I do care when I see a video of an elderly woman forced to crawl to receive her pension. \n\nThe lives of Indians matters way more than the perception of India and whatever time, effort, anger we have should be dedicated to bettering ourselves and the country instead of wasting on rage baiters. \n\nBecome so outstanding that you as an example outweighs 10 bad Indians in forming perceptions.",
        "What feelings are getting hurt? I am giving my opinion abt that dude like he gave his about the country. and why are you so obsessed with people laughing at Indians.",
        ">What feelings are getting hurt?¬†\n\nWhen you use words like this:\n\n> if you have been living under the rock.\n\nits clearly an emotional response and not \"factual\" so no you aren't just giving an opinion\n\n>and why are you so obsessed with people laughing at Indians.\n\nwhat are you mentally deficient? my comment clearly says we shouldn't care about such people you came to argue saying we should care clearly you are the one obsessed.",
        "Yay! Thanks B&B! Needed this.",
        "What is everyone on about? Nothing he said in the video was wrong or racist! I agreed with every single thing he uttered. I have lived in India about 15 years, so multiple cities.. Trivandrum, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai.  So the crux is.. what protein are persons getting? Beef would be the most nutritious option."

I have seen Indians taking selfies with them just because they're foreigners. And these guys are taking advantage of us. Rather than bashing me, your fellow Indian brother, please try to understand my point. I'm not 100% certain about this but I read somewhere that bald and bankrupt is not only a filthy, sleazy PUA but also exploits tons of underprivileged and trafficked girls found in poorer, 3rd world, or countries with conflict going on. He's been exposed online for taking advantage of young girls, exploiting them and then later bragging about how superior he is to these women. I remember reading about all this a few years back and just his mere mention boils my blood. I can't believe these shameless, degenerate motherfuckers are coming back to India, just to shit on our culture and doing selective criticism. I am not bashing you. Like you there are a lot of people, who will get in the trap of these youtubers' intention. Just ignore and move on. üëç you know OP you seem like the only one who cares about their opinion, and even if millions of indians watch them who cares , there are still people who watch kangana ranaut movies do you think they all care about her opinions? Unfortunately a lot of influencers have cracked how to make money from India content. Praise India and thousands of likes and comments will come. Say negative stuff and tens of thousands of comments will come. Either way they make money. The right thing to do is completely ignore the content but that's not going to happen. As a white dude I'm in your side! I liked Mr Bald before when he was more balanced, also a plus for him that he could communicate in hindi with the locals.I think India has made some tremendous growth, people underestimate how hard it is to develop and take what we have in the west for granted It's not just about self-esteem; silence on these issues only allows problems to fester. Ignoring a problem never leads to a solution. In India, we can handle constructive criticism, but what‚Äôs happening now is pure hate and fear-mongering. If you think I should stay quiet or that I lack self-esteem because I‚Äôm defending my country against disrespect, then I encourage you to reevaluate your perspective. He does the same to other countries as well but you don't see them raging like this. The more you get offended the more he will like it bro, everyone shits on everybody. We're not a beacon of anything. When a powerful country like US with its strong R&D, military and tech can get mocked relentlessly by other countries, then what makes us special? Stop taking this personally. So can't we report them in youtube ? Exactly I reported both of them but I think so mass report will work Yes we should Why? there are train like vande bharat they never travel through this trains why never shows that part of India of course india has its issue but India also have some developments like come on what their problem The people in those countries do not rage together because they're getting way less hate than us Indians. The kind of comments we get passed on is terrible. You can't even stand that kind of language spoken against India. And the worst part is, it's becoming a norm, to annihilate Indians, because we don't fight back. And it's not particularly about bald only, there are so many creators doing the same. When 99 percent of country is a shithole how can i agree that india is developing very fastly . How is vande bharat a major development in trains rarely one uses it . Because his videos are catering to a racist audience just go to the comments. Is it that hard to understand? Right now there is kind of a trend to be racist against India, and tour videos like this have became a big part of it. Why are you publicising them? This is what they thrive on. I had no idea about who they are, and now I am aware. And it the video shows up on my feed, Ill be curious to watch now. Let it go man. Two YouTubers can't do much to change India's reputation - good or bad. What 'problems' will fester exactly ? Our image ? The GDP growth data from the world bank wont be hidden to anyone. The investors know, and thats what we need. All the things he said in the video are true tho First thing not millions of Indians watch them, He actually revealed his audience from India is around 6 %. His videos are catering to a racist audience and you can sense the change in his style of vlogs. And his opinions are kinda fueling the current trend of racism going around for Indians, if you have been living under the rock. So why don't I see the racial hatred against the Balkans, Latinas, and eastern Europeans? There is a wide spread racism against Indians, to which these YouTubers are adding more fuel. I don't see Africans being called the n-word for Africa being underdeveloped, but Indians are called pajeets for India being not developed. I used to see him his videos were use to Good but what happened to this bald guy when he come to india that's really a question because he has gone to place far more dangerous then India. It is literally the engagement of people like you that is driving their viewership. It is so classic rage-bait that it is almost old now. There are two sides of good and bad and I thinks they depends on only bad side for rage bait and I don't know from which state are you but here in Gujarat I thinks so they are so many developments have happened here so I don't agree with u that India is 99% shit hole we have brts metro train and this transports are not dirty as they shows in their video and we have gift city in gandhinagar which has many foreigner companies so many opportunities and for low class we have AUDA housing scheme and that's why comparing to Mumbai and delhi in here there are very less people who lives on road so yeah that's my point Because numbers dude. If China had YouTube they‚Äôd probably be rage baited too. I think you engage with rage bait on a regular basis. I don‚Äôt have this problem. I don't know why people giving us down votes but if u can then please report this type of videos it's so funny one of them had a title like never visiting india again on first video then proceed to make more two videos on india so this is clearly a rage bait so please report them Exactly my point bro. I don't know why people here are downvoting your and my comments. Seems like many Indians can't see the fact that hate mongering against India is getting that 'chalta hai' attitude. I agree with you regarding the publication here. But my actual point is, videos like these, elements like these fuel up the already hate citizens of other nations have against India. I know these two solely can't do anything to damage India's reputation, but they contribute a whole lot to the hate community already present there. I also went to their comment section. And not just these two on YouTube, there are so many people who bash us for no reason. Just because we usually ignore them or reply as \"yeah, I agree, my country is bad, as an Indian I approve it\". Like what the hell?? At least these people should be defending the country, but they're doing the exact opposite. But your entire post was about these two people, so my response was in that context. I'm sorry but you're making assumptions. Just because you don't see something doesn't mean it isn't happening. Being from India, it's obvious that you'll be more exposed to India specific content and hence, you might not be aware of what's happening in other regions. I think we should ignore these people the more you view the video or comment the more popular so my opinion just report it don't watch by watching we are indirectly giving it engagement to thier channel Log off? Online is not real world. Most people in the west don't know a lot about or care about India. Ur emotions are valid. But stay away from social media. It‚Äôs called algorithm. If u keep watching these things, they will show u more of these. My social media doesn‚Äôt show me things against India. Just try to watch positive contents. Actually I never watch these kinds of videos where any foreigner is explaining his views on India. Neither did I get it on my feed. I came to know about it on reddit itself, but it was getting bigger and was discussed in many subreddits. So I just researched it a little and then I came to know about the hypocrisy of these two guys and the kind of comments they have in their vids against India specifically. Since I have seen so many racist posts against India already, I just thought that I have to speak up now, because bashing Indians for casual fun is getting out of hand now. Racism against india is not a new thing. You just discovered it recently. Ur anger and energy is wasted here. Imagine u dont like Germany, u r racist against them, would u stop hating germany because some german posted things like ‚Äúenough of these indian c*nts insulting germans‚Äù on reddit, would u stop hating it? No na? The image of India has a lot to do with our global representation. I think the hatred against indians in foreign country is actually declining. It was harsher before. bald was famous among Indians earlier when he used to talk shit about muslims and islam and shout jai bhole etc on mosque entrance, everyone loved him for that, now he made a video criticising the hygiene issue you all turn against him lol Let them do what they want. If you don't like them, just don't watch. See. I do not follow him or watch his videos regularly. I recently came to know about him. And if he's been doing it for so long, why did people like you continue watching him in the first place?? At least you should have pointed it out way before people like me had to do so. >fueling the current trend of racism going around for Indians, if you have been living under the rock. and how does that affect you? reactions like OP and yours are why people laugh at indians your feelings get hurt so quickly The entire world has figured out that triggering or pandering to Indians' need for white approval allows them to exploit a billion strong market. If we stop giving an eff, such videos will also stop. It's about being mature and not giving two hoots about others racism, biases and negativity. I don't care if someone makes such videos. I do care when I see a video of an elderly woman forced to crawl to receive her pension. The lives of Indians matters way more than the perception of India and whatever time, effort, anger we have should be dedicated to bettering ourselves and the country instead of wasting on rage baiters. Become so outstanding that you as an example outweighs 10 bad Indians in forming perceptions. What feelings are getting hurt? I am giving my opinion abt that dude like he gave his about the country. and why are you so obsessed with people laughing at Indians. >What feelings are getting hurt? When you use words like this: > if you have been living under the rock. its clearly an emotional response and not \"factual\" so no you aren't just giving an opinion >and why are you so obsessed with people laughing at Indians. what are you mentally deficient? my comment clearly says we shouldn't care about such people you came to argue saying we should care clearly you are the one obsessed. Yay! Thanks B&B! Needed this. What is everyone on about? Nothing he said in the video was wrong or racist! I agreed with every single thing he uttered. I have lived in India about 15 years, so multiple cities.. Trivandrum, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai. So the crux is.. what protein are persons getting? Beef would be the most nutritious option."
