        ">By the 2021-2022 academic year, Darwin’s theory was quietly removed from  the examination syllabus for the students of Class 9 and Class 10. By  2022-2023, the topic of evolution was completely purged from school  textbooks, teachers and education experts told Al Jazeera.   \nNow, millions of school students will not know who Darwin was or what his theory says – unless they opt for biology in Class 11 and Class 12. \n\nWtf! Theory of evolution is one of the building blocks of science, how is this considered specialised enough to only be available to bio students?",
        "In the \"reduced\" ICSE syllabus for the last 2 years, they cut out Avogadro and the mole concept from Class X chemistry textbooks. \n\nEvolution has always been treated badly, primarily because even many biology teachers don't understand it properly, all this is not that big a surprise. \n\n(Teach chemistry and biology to high school, 10+2 students)",

All that comes only in 11th & 12th.\n\nHow you omit a fundamental set of ideas like thermodynamics in high school I have no fucking clue.",
        "This is so sad. I moved from India to the west as a teen and I was so far ahead of my peers when I enrolled here. It was a huge confidence boost to a kid that was barely passing in India, and I was able to turn it around academically with that newfound confidence. They're robbing the future generations of knowledge of basic scientific concepts.",

        "When we were in 10th, Electromagnetism was totally removed from syllabus, and in 11th many of us struggled in Magnetics section. Not only that, in 11-12th, they fucking removed Gravitational force, and Biology doesn't need any introduction (reproductive system in humans leaves the chat).",
        "I'm not an educational specialist, but these ideas are distillations of the theories and facts that modern technology is based upon. I would think that even a cursory introduction would help one in knowing how the world works.",

        "No, these are more essential than learning a bunch of equations about various acids. Teach essential principles; details anyone can pick up from a book/internet if interested.\n\nWhy wouldn't you teach a child things like why some reactions occur, and others not?

And pretty much built the modern world.\n\nAs a chemistry teacher, I'd rather not force children to mug up a bunch of equations, and instead make them learn fundamental concepts (qualitatively at least, if not mathematically). \n\nMore importantly, learning about all these concepts and how they link together, how they came about etc, even if it is a basic, cursory level, keeps children engaged and gets them to think. Please get rid of this \"not needed by people in their lives\" mentality - education is meant to help you learn to think, learn about the world etc., and isn't just there to provide some utilitarian service.",
        "Ikr, our Physics teacher in 11th was like, \"WHAT? You're trying to convince me that you came to 11th without studying Electromagnetism??

        "There is no end to list of concepts that you think about adding to school syllabus. You can teach them about probabilistic electron cloud, wave particle duality and quantum model and so on to expand their minds. However, everything you add only opens the minds of 5% of students and makes the rest 95% confused and perform poorly.\n\nBeing a chemistry teacher, you are biased about what kids need to learn. All the things you talk about - balanced equations, thermodynamics, statistical physics, quantum theory - none of them are required to be understand by anyone not opting science stream. We don't need to make everyone a scientist.",
        "Of course not, we don't need to make everyone a scientist, but it is essential children have a sense of what Science is, how to ask questions, reason & find answers. \n\nTo do that, it will make more sense to teach them fundamental concepts that underlie all our ideas of reality than make them memorize a bunch of equations like they do now. \n\n(I have similar criticisms to how we teach the humanities and languages, so let me not get started on that)",
        ">but it is essential children have a sense of what Science is, how to ask questions, reason & find answers.\n\nYes, and you don't need them to learn Avogadro number for that.",
        "Avogadro and the mole concept != Avogadro number.\n\nKnowing what moles are, how it was figured out, and how it explained everything that came before helps you make sense of chemical equations. Else, like most children (and I'm speaking from experience here), you will end up memorising a ton of equations and not understand what chemistry is. \n\nI'm going to stop here.",
