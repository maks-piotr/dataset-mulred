I am a male and this is for boys. Like wtf do they have with open neck t shirts ? almost all my clothes are open neck. Also who the fuck are these assholes to decided what I wear or not wear ?\n\nAlso they want us to remember the names of all the senior CRs for some reason ? like why ? this is top level narcissism and the kids must be really f\\*cked up in their head.\n\nDoes this qualify as ragging ?

        "I hate the kinda parents who say just bear with it. UGC needs to update its guidelines.",
        "This is not my first time in a hostel. I have been in hostel in the past during JEE preparation",
        "Tbh it's the only thing they can do cause the parents of some kids complained and the kids got into trouble for that because the seniors have setting with the administration staff",
        "O\\_O",
        "Tweet this to some govt handle, add the college name here, buggers don't even know how to wear a tie yet ask freshers to follow such draconian rules...\nRest assured any restrictions imposed to affect mental well being can be a criminal offence. You need not worry kid if they look too intimidating file an fir",
        "yeah which police station in India would be willing to file an FIR related to a criminal offence affecting mental health ? If I mention the college name, kids in my class would consider me a rat ; in fact, a few of them are reddittors even",
        "Best, I think I could do is approach the anti-ragging squad but if things get worse then I'd have to approach the police, with a good lawyer because under normal circumstances they'd just brush it off even though every kid has to sign an affidavit saying that they'd abide by UGC guidelines and yes you are probably right that this must be violation of some UGC guideline",
        "The intro part sounds as hazing to me, and trust me authorities do take this shit seriously.\nOn a rather unrelated note, hazing sounds pathetic...and rather cowardly ...and this is coming from someone who worked in paramilitary. We had hazing in our days but all my seniors later regretted doing that..",
        "yep, I think so too. Like they have a proper format for their intro part and like as per their \"rules\" we had to send our immediate correspondents (kids who are just 1 year senior to us but same roll number in same department) an email in that intro format. We had to do this like 2 months ago, I hadn't done it but today scared of ragging and stuff I did send the email and that guy's reply at like 7-8PM was are you in the campus ? so yeah sounds like a plan for hazing. Luckily I am not in the college campus rn.\n\nAnd even when I get there, I have just decided to ignore all of their bullshit. I am not bragging or anything but I am more interested in my studies and get lost in them so I wouldn't get time to play fodder for their little ego satisfying activities.",
        "But what about other kids ratting me out ? like the seniors specifically targetting me if I complain to the authorities ? the authorities do say that they will maintain anonymity (the prof in charge is a younger guy than the rest older boomer folks) if someone comes forward with a complaint from their academic email id.",
        "Bro, complain directly to the anti ragging cell of HRD ministry anonymously. They view ragging very seriously and immediate action will be taken. Complaining to the college anti ragging cell will only get you to be targeted by seniors and batchmates alike.",

Medical colleges operate under different circumstances as I've heard). Chill out man, live as you like.",
        "Lol. Idk which college you went to but seriously, you actually believe seniors can make a students life difficult?? Also, CR is nothing but a glorified teachers pet. If you did follow through similar rules then I hate to say it but man you're the worst pushover ever.",

Ppl study for 2-3 some even more to come to this shit... And the thing u said that seniors can't make ur life shit... I didn't understand how that is true.. they can pressurize u to do things na.

The complaint can also be done in a police station, but they probably would not push you enough to do that. YO bruh it was bot command, also if there political connected or rich kids , keep your head down , if not , dont go asking for trouble unless they target you Same rules at my college ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è parents say \"just bear with it, what can you do\", teachers joke about it, seniors go \"this is not ragging, this is just interaction, we're preparing you for the real world\" and we go \"yeah, sucks but pretty much expected, could be worse\" Remembering the names of every senior is the WORST though I've been here for a year and I'm still struggling to remember the names and faces of half my own classmates, I'm pretty bad at that Kinda sucks that as soon as the whole ragging thing became toned down from the severe, news headline making stuff, everyone just acts like it's part of college culture instead of removing it all together remindme!

I hate the kinda parents who say just bear with it. UGC needs to update its guidelines. This is not my first time in a hostel. I have been in hostel in the past during JEE preparation Tbh it's the only thing they can do cause the parents of some kids complained and the kids got into trouble for that because the seniors have setting with the administration staff O\\_O Tweet this to some govt handle, add the college name here, buggers don't even know how to wear a tie yet ask freshers to follow such draconian rules... Rest assured any restrictions imposed to affect mental well being can be a criminal offence. You need not worry kid if they look too intimidating file an fir yeah which police station in India would be willing to file an FIR related to a criminal offence affecting mental health ? If I mention the college name, kids in my class would consider me a rat ; in fact, a few of them are reddittors even Best, I think I could do is approach the anti-ragging squad but if things get worse then I'd have to approach the police, with a good lawyer because under normal circumstances they'd just brush it off even though every kid has to sign an affidavit saying that they'd abide by UGC guidelines and yes you are probably right that this must be violation of some UGC guideline The intro part sounds as hazing to me, and trust me authorities do take this shit seriously. On a rather unrelated note, hazing sounds pathetic...and rather cowardly ...and this is coming from someone who worked in paramilitary. We had hazing in our days but all my seniors later regretted doing that.. yep, I think so too. Like they have a proper format for their intro part and like as per their \"rules\" we had to send our immediate correspondents (kids who are just 1 year senior to us but same roll number in same department) an email in that intro format. We had to do this like 2 months ago, I hadn't done it but today scared of ragging and stuff I did send the email and that guy's reply at like 7-8PM was are you in the campus ? so yeah sounds like a plan for hazing. Luckily I am not in the college campus rn. And even when I get there, I have just decided to ignore all of their bullshit. I am not bragging or anything but I am more interested in my studies and get lost in them so I wouldn't get time to play fodder for their little ego satisfying activities. But what about other kids ratting me out ? like the seniors specifically targetting me if I complain to the authorities ? the authorities do say that they will maintain anonymity (the prof in charge is a younger guy than the rest older boomer folks) if someone comes forward with a complaint from their academic email id. Bro, complain directly to the anti ragging cell of HRD ministry anonymously. They view ragging very seriously and immediate action will be taken. Complaining to the college anti ragging cell will only get you to be targeted by seniors and batchmates alike. &gt;anti ragging cell of HRD ministry wdym ? could you give me a link to the website of this cell/committee you are talking about ? Laughable. You don't have to follow anything except the non-drinking one coz that's the only one they can actually do something about (rat on you). Finished my college 2 years ago, can say with guarantee seniors hold no real power over you, there isn't shit they can do (In engineering. Medical colleges operate under different circumstances as I've heard). Chill out man, live as you like. Lol. Idk which college you went to but seriously, you actually believe seniors can make a students life difficult?? Also, CR is nothing but a glorified teachers pet. If you did follow through similar rules then I hate to say it but man you're the worst pushover ever. Terrace not allowed is quite common coz some people try to suicide from what I've heard. &gt; Do not drink &gt; Sports banned What kinda boring sanghi seniors are these okie thanks, I have decided already to not gib a f\\*ck about them and besides I am a teetotaler Most hardcore kind it seems, my own class has like 15-20 hardcore sanghi Gen Zs out of 68 students well if you'd have read the whole post you'd come to know that one stupid idiot was about to do that precisely while drunk hence that rule What is your point? &gt;some people try to suicide from what I've heard. when in my post I had mentioned : &gt;A guy from (1st year) some other department got drunk in front of the seniors and was like about to jump from the terrace. Yes, your post talks of your college not all colleges in general like my reply does. Op can you give us an update what happened Yeah it's like the students can't do shit about it even if they ate severely damaged (emotionally) Pls provide link. And can we do it anonymously? That's the thing.. when u're new to a college you don't know who to trust and whom to not so it's hard to figure out what to do in a situation like this since it can backfire on you. In my institute, if u speak anything about a senior ragging to a professor and if that professor actually supports ragging which more than half of profs in our clg do then he'll just tell that senior that you told on him and then you're fucked again. I just got ragged yesterday and I don't know what to do other than talk to some trusted seniors.. so i talked to them and they said that FIRs se bhi farak nhi padta... I was like WTF?? And the last year students don't voluntarily rag juniors bcoz they know that they will be at a risk just before getting the degree and moving out. I cried today morning knowing that I was ragged yesterday and it's hard man. Ppl study for 2-3 some even more to come to this shit... And the thing u said that seniors can't make ur life shit... I didn't understand how that is true.. they can pressurize u to do things na. Pls explain how to not be bothered by the seniors... And yes we also have an intro and we hv to greet every senior every single fucking time we see them. Fucking hell. Yes pls"
