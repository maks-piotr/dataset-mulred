They outnumber us like 1 to 15-20. They all are fucking poor. \n\nMeanwhile I can say about the Sub Saharan Africa that people there probably do better than statistics as they don't have a highly commercialized society and can live more freely on the unencumbered public land.",

        "Sorry, I did not mean anything personally. To deconstruct my comment, Pakistan was based on very different ideals than our nation. The term Pakistan was not even a thing till 1930s. Imagine AIADMK  inventing a word Takstan in 2000s and by 2017, Takstan would be TN, Andhra and Kerala as a separate country...that is how Pakistan was born...just because Gandhi got burnt supporting Indians being sent to WW-I meatgrinder and asserting a better deal come WW-II. Gandhi launched a movement against Britishers which was totally right, US ignored WW-II as well till Japanese attacked them. But here, Britishers got hurt and supported Jinnah instead. Britishers were impoverished, so they decided to split the country just like they sowed the seed in Israel-Palestine and in many places in Africa. \n\nLong story short, Pakistan was a rump state with no ideology, no unifying factor than Jinnah who died like a year after birthing this state. They don't have a founding philosophy. no love for democracy, they just survive one crisis to another. \n\n  \nLong story short, citing Zia ul Haq as some groundbreaking thing is silly because he was just a stupid idiot ruling a countrey which has still not realized what is its place in the world.",

        "As I said I don't deny the existence of poor people. But there are also small scale business owners, people who work abroad, large scale farmers, freelancing people etc who hide their income to save tax. When I said most I didn't mean most are paid well but even the poor people don't show the exact income so the stats are not accurate. And I'm from Kerala so we have comparatively fewer extreme poor people here.",

        "I very well know the living conditions aren't good but claiming this is a bit too much. \n\nOP, if you like watching such videos, go and watch the documentaries about living conditions in Sub-Sahara, which is war-torn. \n\nIt seems people of this sub aren't educated enough about economic history, and hence unable to debunk to not call this out a fake claim, which was pretty much in a run during 1997. \n\nIt was the UNDP's HDR report that stated that the percentage of the population of India was living in similar conditions as those of Sub-Saharans, which was true to some extent. I am in shock that this fact is still believed by some entrepreneur who is on a podcast. \n\nMind you it was 27 years ago.\n\nToday India's HDI is 0.633 while Sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria and Chad have 0.400 and 0.394. Life expectancy in India is 70, while Nigeria is at 54 and Chad is at 56. The literary rate has risen to 77% from 61%. \n\nThe guy whose video is shown himself didn't say that, so he played safe if this data was proven incorrect. Also, why the fuck you are watching videos of such people? They might be informative but not expert, and fucking read every single source he cited; no where such indication is there what is claimed in this post. \n\nOP are you in your teens or what? So you can't decide what to go through before posting shit. \n\nIt was one of the stupidest statements I have heard in a while.",

They might even fare better if that is taken into account.",
        "Tbf I was not responding to the country comparison but to the stats saying earning 25k+ puts you in the top 10%. As There are many middle class people who show their income below that even though they earn more. But again the amount doesn't say anything because someone who earns 25k in Mumbai City with a family is a lot poorer than someone who earns 15k in some rural village with no dependants.",
        "They deleted my earlier comment because heaven forbid one includes a link to some legit reference here, gotta maintain the stupid level of discussion. The comment was:\n\n>The same can be said about a lot of Nation States.\n\nI agree. I do not know what makes Pakistan just not click as a cohesive unit. Maybe hard land borders which were not the case for Jamaica?! Cannot say.\n\n>Basically Ideology of a country matters as much as it's origins.\n\nThey really had no ideology. The name itself is some portmanteau of regions which made no sense in 1930s when it was proposed, nor do they make any sense now like this thread: \\*\\*censored\\*\\*",

    "light_cleaned_comments": "But how do we fare against Pakistan? /s Typical Indian mentality...compare against Pakistan when things are bad....compare against US and China when stats look good. Sounds about right. Most of you on Reddit aren’t part of that 92.5% State board se jee advanced crack nai hota Really? Look around you and think wisely. Which is true. It’s visible literally everywhere you go. Not just in how people look, behave and interact with each other, but also in their mindset. I remember someone saying that India will be ‘superpower’ by 2020. But this is the reality even now. India was supposed to do industrialise like rest of the world. And 7.5% of Indians is still about 100m people Why bother with reality when you have YouTubers and BBC to rail against for defaming India? Well, if you earn ₹25000+ per month, you are in the top 10% of earners in India, supposedly from a 2021 government report. And redditors on some subs cry they can't survive with 30LPA. Income badhti hai toh kharche bhi badhte hain. (As income grows, expenses rise too). Paisa kahan se aata hai, kahan jaata hai, nahi pata chalta. Everyone I meet today seems to be from 0.5% . Not to undermine poor state of India but other than salaries employees, most don't reveal their actual income to the govt for tax reasons. So on paper they only own less. This analogy was by Kishore Biyani. He also mentioned trickle down economics doesn't work Most don't make shit. They'd starve and their families would starve if they had to pay taxes. The veg/fruit hawker, the auto driver, the guy behind the kirana store, the guy who washes your car every morning etc etc. Only a few of the people we interact with everyday. They outnumber us like 1 to 15-20. They all are fucking poor. Meanwhile I can say about the Sub Saharan Africa that people there probably do better than statistics as they don't have a highly commercialized society and can live more freely on the unencumbered public land. One thing I have observed during my life is india is always at the top of bad ratings list and bottom of good ratings list 😉 Not sure how to read this… shouldn’t Africa be better? Just because someone else makes less money doesn't mean 30L/ Year salary people are automatically rich. Houses and most other things have costs similar to western countries. The biggest joke is Pakistan used to have a thriving economy in the 1970s. General Zia came and radicalized the society beyond repair. Something to think about. But saar GDP... I many times wondered why communists couldn't get a foothold across a nation where the few exploit the masses at such high levels, and the people face so many challenges on a daily basis. Perhaps it is the fatalism instilled by our religion. 1970s is like 50 years away, closer to like 1970s folks complaining about World War I times no? My memory is like 1990s or nothing man. You said...Zia ul what? Perhaps the trouble is that Indians are fed on all this stupid historical nonsense so our one eye is fixated on the past while our other eye is fixated on the work we are supposed to do. Meaning we neither know the history well, nor we are productive enough in the work we do. I honestly don't understand your comment. All I was trying to say was the decision you take today impacts future generations. This is true even for personal level as well as for a societal level. Railway track pe pta ni kyu hagg te hai log , bahar jayo tuti road , hygiene , infrastructure kuch jagah meh karke flex marna India ko super power nahi bna sakta I was just watching this video.... Great video . Mohak mangal ka video dekh ke aya hai na?🤣🤣🤣 go look at utube videos of african cities theyre better built and cleaner Sorry, I did not mean anything personally. To deconstruct my comment, Pakistan was based on very different ideals than our nation. The term Pakistan was not even a thing till 1930s. Imagine AIADMK inventing a word Takstan in 2000s and by 2017, Takstan would be TN, Andhra and Kerala as a separate country...that is how Pakistan was born...just because Gandhi got burnt supporting Indians being sent to WW-I meatgrinder and asserting a better deal come WW-II. Gandhi launched a movement against Britishers which was totally right, US ignored WW-II as well till Japanese attacked them. But here, Britishers got hurt and supported Jinnah instead. Britishers were impoverished, so they decided to split the country just like they sowed the seed in Israel-Palestine and in many places in Africa. Long story short, Pakistan was a rump state with no ideology, no unifying factor than Jinnah who died like a year after birthing this state. They don't have a founding philosophy. no love for democracy, they just survive one crisis to another. Long story short, citing Zia ul Haq as some groundbreaking thing is silly because he was just a stupid idiot ruling a countrey which has still not realized what is its place in the world. Things will not change in 2047 either. >Sorry, I did not mean anything personally. No offense taken. >Long story short, Pakistan was a rump state with no ideology, no unifying factor than Jinnah w The same can be said about a lot of Nation States. For example, Jamaica was founded by indentured servants from the African countries, India etc. The fact is they decided to use it to their advantage by creating a proper constitution and rule of law and it is a fairly middle income country now. Basically Ideology of a country matters as much as it's origins. If a country is actually liberal, usually people would be happy living there and ready to invest capital the opposite happens when it becomes fascist. >Long story short, citing Zia ul Haq as some groundbreaking Nope, if you create laws such as closing of night clubs, disallow selling of alcohol, Huddlum laws, Sharia Courts, Subjection of Women etc. All this leads to severe economic consequences. As I said I don't deny the existence of poor people. But there are also small scale business owners, people who work abroad, large scale farmers, freelancing people etc who hide their income to save tax. When I said most I didn't mean most are paid well but even the poor people don't show the exact income so the stats are not accurate. And I'm from Kerala so we have comparatively fewer extreme poor people here. Mitroooooonnnnn, Vishwaguru hain hum. Marketing, PR and Event Management ke Vishwaguru. Forgot to add: Jinnah just thought the country will continue like India, in a secular fashion. He never meant it to be an Islamic state. Jinnah did not even sell his Bombay residence because he thought he and his sister would visit there often. I very well know the living conditions aren't good but claiming this is a bit too much. OP, if you like watching such videos, go and watch the documentaries about living conditions in Sub-Sahara, which is war-torn. It seems people of this sub aren't educated enough about economic history, and hence unable to debunk to not call this out a fake claim, which was pretty much in a run during 1997. It was the UNDP's HDR report that stated that the percentage of the population of India was living in similar conditions as those of Sub-Saharans, which was true to some extent. I am in shock that this fact is still believed by some entrepreneur who is on a podcast. Mind you it was 27 years ago. Today India's HDI is 0.633 while Sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria and Chad have 0.400 and 0.394. Life expectancy in India is 70, while Nigeria is at 54 and Chad is at 56. The literary rate has risen to 77% from 61%. The guy whose video is shown himself didn't say that, so he played safe if this data was proven incorrect. Also, why the fuck you are watching videos of such people? They might be informative but not expert, and fucking read every single source he cited; no where such indication is there what is claimed in this post. OP are you in your teens or what? So you can't decide what to go through before posting shit. It was one of the stupidest statements I have heard in a while. Sub-Sahara is the claim here!! Go fucking watch how Sub-Sahara look like. That would be the case for subsaharan countries too. So it doesn't change our position relatively. But yeah, makes us feel better knowing people aren't exactly that poor. stop living in bubble look at rwanda Other countries also have their share of tax dodgers. Crypto King Sam Bankman-Fried was living in Bahamas with his cabal. He might spend rest of his life in a US jail. When all these common black money trends are cancelled, I am not sure if India would fare even worse or better, compared to SSA which do not have this high level of a formal ecoomy but have a better social network to feed off the land. They might even fare better if that is taken into account. Tbf I was not responding to the country comparison but to the stats saying earning 25k+ puts you in the top 10%. As There are many middle class people who show their income below that even though they earn more. But again the amount doesn't say anything because someone who earns 25k in Mumbai City with a family is a lot poorer than someone who earns 15k in some rural village with no dependants. They deleted my earlier comment because heaven forbid one includes a link to some legit reference here, gotta maintain the stupid level of discussion. The comment was: >The same can be said about a lot of Nation States. I agree. I do not know what makes Pakistan just not click as a cohesive unit. Maybe hard land borders which were not the case for Jamaica?! Cannot say. >Basically Ideology of a country matters as much as it's origins. They really had no ideology. The name itself is some portmanteau of regions which made no sense in 1930s when it was proposed, nor do they make any sense now like this thread: \\*\\*censored\\*\\* Fair point and I agree. I do not know about this 25K figure, that is why I mentioned it with \"supposedly\". Earlier, we used to have proper consumption surveys which do a better job with estimating income, then labor surveys etc, but since 2014....most of that is verboten. Yes because those 92.5% consider themselves entitled to subsidies (or freebies) by the government. >Other countries also have their share of tax dodgers. Crypto King Sam Bankman-Fried was Not comparable to India. We have a legit shadow economy. I know, but as for its effect on the budget, corporations dodging taxes as they are registered abroad, tax evasion, living on some island etc, the impact on governament revenue is not much diffrerent than India. If you are analysing data that analyse correctly, I think we as a nation had less per capita income. Then most of sub sharan Africa until late 90s. Let's not forget we have approx 3% direct tax payers in this country not because it's filled with evaders but also cz majority are EXEMPT from it (agriculture). Do you have the numbers on how much income tax contribution the 1% are doing? Out of the income tax collection how much of it is contributed by the top 1%? As someone else said on another comment, do not expect these issues to be better in SSA. They may have it even worse, meaning India is even worse then them accounting for all these nuances you say. Is it Sub-Saharan Africa or the entire Africa? India is a land of opportunities but you need to work hard, there will be people pulling you down on every step but you just have to be persistent. Politics won’t matter , just put in your work and you will rise the ladder. Praise the people who work hard, learn from them, don’t be jealous. Make India a better place to live and grow. I love my india 🇮🇳 What's so surprising about this? Most of Sub-Saharan Africa and India fall in the same income category: lower-middle. Nothing wrong with what you said, but don't let your love blind you to sad facts, in case you are doing that. There are four World Bank income classifications: 1. High 2. Upper-middle 3. Lower-middle 4. Low Most of Sub-Saharan Africa is low income, while India is lower-middle. All developed countries like America and Japan are high income. Make of this what you will With rise in income expenses lower as basic needs are fulfilled (though luxurious wants increases) and savings increase. Economics me to ye hi padha tha, lagta hai practical nai tha Not really. Most of it is worse off than India but not by a lot. Most of Sub-Saharan Africa is a low-income region while India is a marginally better lower-middle income region. See the data here: They all use the internet and are fluent in English, of course dude. 0.8% are contributing to 42% direct tax collection. [here](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/rising-share-of-personal-income-tax-and-indirect-tax) >As someone else said on another comment Should go with a source over what someone else claims in the comments. One thing India has going for it is being a democracy despite being such a poor country. It's like the only country in the world along with Senegal and Ghana which has managed to stay a democracy while the rest of its poor peers have failed to do so. Yeah! So, how come you'll equate 92% of the population with the Sub-Saharan? Do you see any logic in that argument? I am not sure what the exact number is supposed to be, but similar per capita incomes suggest similar quality of life for an average Indian and an average person in Sub-Saharan Africa Everything is broken in this country and these people are still optimistic and believe in government and politicians. How? We got free market economy in 1991. Subramanian Swamy tried in 70s but Indira Gandhi got him fired from IIT for suggesting capitalism to India. Only for the same to be implemented by manmohan singh in 91 after the collapse of USSR and our backs against the wall. Today every keeps talking about manmohan lol. We have to wait. Kalki will come and save us 😮‍💨 Proud to be Indian This is an issue which goes beyond party lines. Economic empowerment isn't an issue for them because it isn't an issue for the people, they'd rather vote on caste and religious lines. Until there's a humongous change in the collective mindset of people in this country, just remember KACCHE BADALNE SE DAST NAHI RUKTE. Just curious why do you think houses in almost every city in India are crazy expensive?? No drainage no infrastructure or any other facilities still properties in some of the localities where I live are over 60-70 lac You can thank Nehru-Gandhis for that. A cup of tea used to cost 50 paise in the 90s. Don't agree with it at all. I have been to sub Saharan Africa and I come from those 92 percent you are referring to. This might have been true in 2002 but today it's not correct at all. I'll admit that their earning levels are low but we are way better off than sub Saharan Africa because of technological and infrastructural advancements. Sub Saharan Africa is literally a lawless jungle. So if you wanna compare then compare comprehensively. Supply & Demand. We only have a handful of cities in India. China which has comparable size to India in terms of population has many more good cities. WFH would have solved all our problems but understand that there are vested interests in keeping housing costs higher. Housing is seen as an investment and not a place to live unfortunately. > Today India's HDI is 0.633 while Sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria and Chad have 0.400 and 0.394. Life expectancy in India is 70, while Nigeria is at 54 and Chad is at 56. The literary rate has risen to 77% from 61%. Taking overall (averaged) statistics is I think missing the point the video makes. The point is that India has small pockets with a very high HDI (or Income or Literacy rate) similar to Singapore, yet at the same time large swathes of the population live in places (or conditions) with a very low HDI like Sub-Saharan Africa. When you average this out, it looks okay. But beneath that hides the disparity where a small percent of extremely rich outliers result in skewing the values and making it look okay. Like actually xd even mormal vendors and thela wala earns in lakhs but pretty sure they dont show their income xd Man you are suppose to agree with op why will you pointing out these facts we are living in same condition with similar conditions like sub-sahara african /s Thats without taking into account how much the average person in that top 8% gets fucked over by the system in general be it police asking for bribes, taxes that are spent on nothing, being overworked, etc. So while it may seem like the 8% are the only ones living a normal life, in reality it's like the top 1-2% Look at what? Their HDI is even below Bihar. Their GDP per capita lower than UP. Except for National Roads all their street are mud street. Except for tiny part of their capital city which is \"planned\", almost all parts have mud street with open sewers. I call this biggest pile of crap It doesn't account business owner, farmer or sole proprietorship STFU you, we are Vishwaguru Bro Mohak literally talked about this on an \"economical\" basis. We are not taking into account the internet, opportunities, infrastructure, law etc. And don't forget the kind of money africa gets for different kinda trafficking (dru*s, s*x, minerals, and several other resources) Economics is theoretical only in a lot of aspects 5% Mexico gang where you at? But on a more serious note, this isn't surprising. It's definitely depressing though. Economics works objectively, humans function emotionally or subjectively. I see many people happy with a 12LPA job. And as the other comment said, some people complain about their low salary as they \"barely make 30LPA\". If you already own a home and a car, a family of 3 can easily survive on 1.5L per month and also practise their hobbies, go on trips, etc. But yeah if you don't own a home, 30LPA won't be enough for someone aspiring to buy his own home in a Tier 1 city. always count on a chaddi to turn MMS's contibutions to one of the chaddi leader's Glad you and I aren't in this category /s well he did implement it really well. I dont know if its true or not, statistics are usually inflated or misrepresented to make a point. But, the fact that this is believable is sad. Sub Saharan Africa is itself exceedingly diverse, using it as a euphemism doesnt even make sense. Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana all are pretty good and progressing and at the same time there are countries like DRC, CAR etc which are shithole. The average of Sub Saharan Africa hides a very high variance within itself. When you say 92% of India is like Sub Saharan Africa, is it closer to Botswana or DRC? That in itself is a mountain of difference! Its high time we stop using Sub Saharan Africa as a useful entity for yardstick of comparison MMS in his own book has credited Swamy but thanks for the ad hominems. Never said he did a bad job, we were LATE. All it took was for the Gandhi's to be dead and non Gandhi on the PM seat for the drastic change. China under deng xiaoping who opened China's economy in 70s. I like manmohan as a finance minister but a PM I see him as a spineless minister. It was under his reign that Congress is were pushing 26/11 attack on rss and pushed it as saffron terrorism and would've got away had it not been for Tukaram Omble who laid down his life and helped catch kasab alive. And then many right wing indians will criticise those on the left for hating capitalists. This is what you get when you are the kind of people who allow a billionaire to use an airport for the public as his own personal runway for his son's wedding. The problem is the people who face this will never be on this app so they can be conveniently ignored. Exactly 😂😂 great video? The comparison is so flawed. Only bihar can be compared to sub Saharan level. Dude 30LPA is very much rich. There's no doubt about it. You’re missing the point. You can’t use the whole average HDI to apply to all Indians. Most people live in essentially destitution, as in Africa. Sub Saharan Africa is not all “war torn”. That’s in immensely ignorant statement. Plenty of countries are not in conflict. Is india war torn because of naxalites and manipur? Honestly, we are barely better. And Bangladesh is already overtaking us in some aspects. we have terrible land and FSI regulations you can barely build anything in most cities. hyderbad is the sole exception and ofc politicians and land mafia will protrect their money Yep you are absolutely right, the infrastructure is shit but that's not the economy.. See that's not the point, I know everything is broken, but at least do the right comparison. Until tum SC/STs nahi ho > But how do we fare against Pakistan? Funny thing is, Pakistanis don't consider themselves anywhere close to where India is (they consider themselves in a much worse situation). Indian politicians literally like to punch down to make themselves feel better. While I unfortunately do understand what this is trying to say, it's well beyond time we stopped clumping every African nation into one group of countries. Comparing a country with a continent is just absurd statistical cartwheeling, and we are comparing and average of several countries to one nation. None of that is to say that it is also just insulting to all those people that we have never bothered to learn enough about them to separate the different countries. We don't do that with countries from any other continent. While this is a statistic you didn't create OP, so I'm not blaming you in particular for any of this, we as people just need to do better. Lol Today I feel Polish Everyone who thinks they are Mexico are actually Poland. Thoda or liche chale jate free me milti thi or piche jate to milti nahi thi English => could have gone a little more back when the tea was free? Ki fark painda hai? Hum Vishwaguru hai. \\*insert Michael Scott thank you gif\\* Man we have dumb politician, but are you saying that we needed mai treatment, Too sadistic About religion, nah we are not religious like others. Religion is not organised. There is no higher temporal seat, bringing communism a supposed replacement of religion will be concentration of power. Tbh I like your suggestion but concentration and making everybody of one type( the type is defined by you) is the same thing why the current govt gets flak. Great point. That it is believable that too by people on reddit. Even one search of mortality rate can tell you a lot but saying that 9 out of 10 indian lives similar to people in extreme poverty is shocking. Like hygiene and aesthetics are not the only parameters. That's 70 lakh people Do not hate anybody for any reason have an argument put it forward, leveling nit picking is quite easy. They do have very good arguments and it's not \"nitpicking\" it's very valid. India by in large is still a agrarian society. This isn't about free market, it's about moving majority of you population from agriculture workers into industrial workers. Top 1% pays more than 80% of the individual income tax. We had license raj, which crippled industrialization. >it's about moving majority of you population from agriculture workers into industrial workers. USSR forced people into the jobs the state wanted, let's not forget that. No it definitely isn't. If you take the entirety of India with all backward states and areas, then yeah, marginally. Sure, our per capita income had fluctuations and Bangladesh was marginally higher, but that's not the case anymore. Considering the number of IT hubs, GCCs, financial centers, manufacturing plants, ports, airports, rail infrastructure, etc are built, it is almost insulting to compare India with Bangladesh by cherry picking some rural area. We should compare ourselves to rapidly growing SEA economies if not China. Why doesn't it work? I'm not talking about why we didn't, ofcourse we can look into that. I'm saying we didn't and now we have to the price of it. We were simply late with the liberalisation of our economy and failed to make the most of it as well. Simply opening the economy without addressing the bureaucratic red tapes involved was short sighted and some person has the gall to say it was implemented well by mms LOL We have one of the highest numbers of slaves/indentured laborers in our country, well above nearly all countries. Our infrastructure many a times looks worse than war torn areas. Sure, the 92.5% still have more intergenerational mobility, and a stable country and economy to grow their wealth in, but is far, far from a bed of roses. Our intergenerational income elasticity is still double that of China's or most other SEA countries. while the income itself is nearly nothing. Whatever MMS did was better than staying with what we had. Of course it would've been done sooner and with removing more beuracratic hurdles. We lost almost two crucial decades worth of growth, due to Indira not following Swamys suggestion. Not recognising our wrongs, hinders our growth further. We have to recognise what moves have truly helped transform India and make it a core principle for our future. Swamy is also the guy sidelined by BJP because he wants to abolish income tax. When I say that we should've liberalized way sooner that's me recognizing fault. I don't care for Swamy but I do agree with his economic takes. This report is misunderstood by soo many. Basically they are trying to imply that the average per capita income of top 10% is 25000 plus. The one thing everyone miss here is in a family there is one earner (father) and 3 dependent members. Hence, the monthly income of the family gets divided into 4 parts while calculating this 25000 figure. So, a general estimate is 25*4, i.e 1 lakh per month is the correct answer which is not bad I’d say. > It was under his reign that Congressis were blaming 26/11 attack as a false flag operation on rss and pushed it as saffron terrorism You guys blame Muslims any time a bomb is even mentioned, don’t try to play victims here. And yes, RSS is a terrorist organisation, cope. India is doing much better than Nigeria by a mile. The GDP per capita in Nigeria is 3 times smaller than India. South Africa and Botswana are the only ones with decent economies out of all African countries. I think you didn't read that correctly, I have often wondered why communists didn't get a higher buy. In 40s, I am a cynic now, I don't much care what type of jokers are at the centre, were fucked anyways. Glad to participate in the loot much as I can now. Things seem bad now, back in the 80, 90s and 2000s it was even worse, fuck life was tough, many places didn't even have a presence of governance. My own village got a road in 2010s, if you had a terminal condition there, might as well shoot yourself. The only reason I see for all of the poor not picking up arms like the naxalites and burning down the whole show is religion and the fatalism it brings to India, otherwise I don't see how they can endure the loot that has been going on in this banana republic. the executive, the legislative and the judiciary are certainly not the reason. Well you are the one who downplayed MMS's role. Giving credit to someone in your book doesnt mean they did it and you didnt. Dreams come true but not here . I was not just considering per capita income but also HDI, life expectancy and global hunger index which are also important. I agree that Bangladesh shouldn't be our goal but rather southeast Asian countries then followed by China. They weren't around after the 50s and 60s. And life for soany has been shit. Democracy is a fucking joke. I can see some contribution of our socio-religious framework. You're basically saying it was ok for congress to lie and blame a Pakistani terrorist attack on rss and hindus because your Islamist mindset hates Hindus and wants them to be blamed for attacks done by people you support? Understood. >You guys blame Muslims any time a bomb is even mentioned, don’t try to play victims here. Let's see who was responsible for bomblasts in my city of Mumbai [14 attacks kindly the religion of attackers and do the math](https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/mumbai_blast.htm) Lol ok buddy whatever floats your boat. This is why we can't have good things in India people have 0 acceptance of opportunity cost. > Paisa kahan se aata hai, kahan jaata hai, nahi pata chalta ... That might be a problem, pata rakho yaar 😂 30 lpa is often ctc, take home is around 20-25L, you get around 12-16 lacks in hand. Then there are loans, other taxes, kids school fees, rent and so on, leaving savings to be significantly lower than what you;d expect in that salary. And other option is to live like a miser, which, many people do and many don't. P.S This is not mine, but a friend's. > You're basically saying it was ok for congress to lie and blame a Pakistani terrorist attack on rss and hindus because your Islamist mindset hates Hindus and wants them to be blamed for attacks done by people you support? Of course, RSS dickrider immediately equated RSS with all Hindus lmao. Try giving gyaan on Islamist mindset once you’ve stopped thinking like Islamists, mmkay? > 14 attacks kindly go through the religion of attackers and do the math Oh, so blaming Muslims for bomb blasts regardless of who did it is okay but blaming a terrorist organisation like RSS for terrorism isn’t? Okay. Keep supporting terrorists, terrorist. That first line is a pile of BS and I am not saying that it's a bed of roses but it's not sub Saharan. Don't talk about something you have never seen in your life. >Of course, RSS dickrider immediately equated RSS with all Hindus lmao. Hey stupid, it was a Pakistani terror attack which was called saffron terrorism. >Oh, so blaming Muslims for bomb blasts regardless of who did it is okay but blaming a terrorist organisation like RSS for terrorism isn’t? Okay. I simply turned your OWN logic against you. Cope Now compare his spine to our pm now. MMS seems like an iron man compared to him. Bjp has lost all rights to call MMS any names. You dont spend much money when poor because you simply dont have it. Indira had more guts than Modi that's something I can agree on for sure. Manmohan was a softie, who as a PM couldn't go against Rajmata of the party. >MMS seems like an iron man compared to him. Just false. Did you respond to the wrong thread? My opinion is that's the case because of lower unemployment and female labour participation rate being that much higher in Bangladesh. Props to them for focusing on that for the last few decades. Still, it's not exactly by a huge margin, and we just have far too much potential compared to them. Their growth in the next 2 decades is marred by higher external debt, lower FDI and a substantially worse industrial base in everything other than maybe the textile industry, which is also changing. Plus, their Gini coefficient is far lower than ours. While that does mean more equality, it also just means that they probably cannot build wealth at the scale we or other advanced economies can. We have far more potential to build multibillion or trillion dollar companies than they do, which is evidenced by our relatively small and not too innovative but still budding startup ecosystem now. Manmohan didn't even do anything for Pakistan to feel the repercussions of carrying out Mumbai 26/11 attack. Please don't call him iron man for the sake of it, he's far from it. I call him iron man for facing the press and not hiding behind godi media. He is the good uncle we only valued after we lost him. What's worse is that the 92% is taking over the country and telling the educated elites how to live via moral policing and communalism >not going fascist Implies we are in a fascist state now. Which is false. You wouldn't be able to type what you did in a fascist state. Sensationalism should have its limits, we are not printing headlines here to evoke reactions from dimwits. >I call him iron man for facing the press That's something Modi has not done and I agree on this. Also don't make mistakes assuming media wasn't sold pre 2014. Understand one thing media is always sold, some will push left narrative and some push right while few pretend to be centrist. Assumption that press was independent and free pre 2014 is pure false. > Implies we are in a fascist state now. Which is false. Yes yes, people like Stan Swamy rot to death in jail while rapist murderers are released and celebrated in a democratic state 🤡 > Also don't make mistakes assuming media wasn't sold pre 2014. Typical of a BJP loving redditor to pretend media was equally as bad as it is now. Media was never this bad. That times it was just lenient on govt, this time its a rabid dog of the govt. Huge difference. Instead of driving attention away from opposition,they demonise them!! This is a catastrope. Hopefully, the international community give us Emergency Aid So you think i can only point that out, after we go full fascist? By that logic, then we wouldn't be fascist because \"see? nobody says we are!!\" Also ho see the comment sections in YouTube. We are halfway there. Its like a person shoots someone, and the victim survives. But you will frown upon the victim if they accuse the shooter of murder. Hey clown maoism is banned. It's an armed movement which fights against established govt be it congress or bjp doofus, being affiliated with them gets you arrested. Him being an activist doesn't give anyone the right to affiliate with maoists. Same applies to Gautam Navlakha who was also arrested in Bhima koregaon. Gautam Navlakha himself gives pro radical speeches which align with militants and separatists. He calls people that takes up arms against the state as freedom fighters. Picking up arms against the state is not accepted in any working democracy 🤡 >Typical of a BJP loving redditor to pretend media was equally as bad as it is now. You seem to be high on headlines and short on facts. Journalists were courted, given awards and even agents/middle men of cabinet seats. Have you heard of radia scam? Do you know what it was? Journalists who were helping ministers secure seats in various ministries through their contacts in high command. I'll give you a video of you have the patience to watch it go for it. [radia tapes journalists helping politicians secure ministries via connections in congress](https://youtu.be/ZQs84kDLmRc?si=Kj6bmrJVFweI9ZgC) >So you think i can only point that out, after we go full fascist? Over exaggerated. Boogeyman tactics. It's like the Hindu rashtra, never gonna happen. If they wanted to have a one party system it would've happened by now, they had the majority to do whatever they wanted but instead they did 370. >Media was never this bad. [radia tapes](https://youtu.be/ZQs84kDLmRc?si=Kj6bmrJVFweI9ZgC) > Him being an activist doesn't give anyone a free pass to affiliate with maoists. So where was the proof that he was working with maoists, smoothbrain? Also the sheer audacity of whining about law and order while rapist murderers are getting freed and celebrated every other day 🤡 Don’t try to push narratives on me kid, unlike you my political awareness didn’t start from 2014. All major news outlets pushed every single scam and wrongdoing of Congress day in and day out, regardless if it was an actual one or a forged one. None of them were bending over backwards like you did when it came to hiding BJP’s crimes. You’re whining about radia tapes? Modi is openly on record lying about electoral bonds with news “anchors” pushing that narrative. So go stuff your bullshit in your bigoted family whatsapp groups, it won’t fly here. they very well tried. Its just that You cant do that shit in one term, gotta destroy the pillars slowly one by one beyond recognition. And they still did. petrol reaching 100rs would have fallen the UPA. Not bad enough. >All major news outlets pushed every single scam and wrongdoing of Congress day in and day out, regardless if it was an actual one or a forged one Radia tapes was true, 2g scam was true, digvijay singh pushing 26/11 as a saffron terrorism narrative was also true. You just deny facts presented lol. > 2g scam was true [So true 🤡](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2g-spectrum-verdict-no-proof-of-scam-says-court-a-scam-of-lies-says-congress/articleshow/62201212.cms) > You just deny facts presented lol. Rapist supporting it cell loser says what? >Rapist supporting it cell loser says what? [Funny🤡](https://theprint.in/politics/why-congress-took-back-choudhary-lal-singh-jk-ex-minister-who-supported-kathua-rape-accused/2011771/) 🤣🤣🤣 Really glad you got one minister from Congress, eh? Too bad I can list one from every other day BJP decides to garland one. Both congress and bjp have 5 lawmakers accused of rape. [ADR](https://adrindia.org/151-sitting-mps-and-mlas-face-cases-of-crimes-against-women-16-charged-with-rape-association-for-democratic-reforms-report/cid/2042549) While it is possible to skew the average income, I doubt the same would be applicable for HDI/Life expectancy. The rich can't live 1000+ years to skew the results. Similarly, the HDI is a normalized from 0 to 1, again making it impossible to skew the average value. No offense intended, just clarifying things. Meanwhile BJP is committing fraud in SC to protected convicted rapist murderers. It's a statement by the Global Slavery index. There are a number of cases that could support this statistic. Treatment of Mahadalits in various states from indebted workers laying bricks and being paid barely enough money for sustenance to Tamil Nadu where contract workers aren't even paid properly for manual scavenging without proper equipment or migrant agricultural workers forced to work to little to no money with their documents being confiscated in Punjab or miners in stone quarries paid in installments, which they were never able to fully claim due to fraudulent deductions, and were unable to leave due to the financial burden imposed by their employers. Even in terms of access to drinking water, we're pretty similar, around 90% in urban areas and 60% in rural. And if anything, in the near future, unless we MASSIVELY reduce our usage of water, we're gonna be in a far more of a pickle than them. We have half their water reserves with several hundred million more people. They're only limited by infrastructure, which can always be improved and most countries will always take an interest in Africa. SEA or East Asia doesn't have problems like these, certainly not to THIS extent. And the other continents have a shit ton of resources and/or money relative to their population. Which other country/continent faces dire problems like this? >fucks like you I did it? Sounds like it's you seething. Would I hold you personally responsible for every \"secular\" riot under congress? No. Get some air. >KACCHE BADALNE SE DAST NAHI RUKTE Oh wow 💀 Bro has clearly not been to Uttar Pradesh 👀 Erm, communism have had a stron presence in India hstoricaly. You'r governments before the 90s were inspired by socialism, you have the naxalites and you got strong communist precense in Kerala and West Bengal The Global slavery index is a propaganda forum. It's owned by walk free and is often used by the west to attack the BRICS and G20. It's utterly stupid to pay any heed to their ratings. The problems you mentioned do exist in India but nowhere on the scale which is mentioned. The entire report is based on irrational criterion only to demean a bunch of targets. What they do is they take the American standards and try to judge every country with the same yardstick. They do not take into account the local economics and ground reality which differs from place to place. Yes that much I know, have followed the news. What I saw in my travels across India from 2000 to now confused me as to why these downtrodden don't join movements like the naxals and wipe out the whole damn thing, it never looked as of the system of power was actually doing anything for them, and the levels of poverty and despair were njust mind numbing. Thank god they didn't, I wouldn't have gotten anything from it, would only have list everything I was able to get. What I saw was just that the social religious framework of India somehow managed to help avoid it. Good for them, often it leads to a disaster. The means doesn't justify the ends, hopefully India can reform anyway. Should be said I'm not against left policies, but there's often better ways to change than thru a communist revolution. Why did you write an English translation of one sentence but not the second? Lol, like I care what some rapist murderer supporter thinks of me. Try leaving your it cell job first before giving gyaan on getting air. How much did tea cost on the streets in 1991 according to you, sir? >You can’t even do that, because Congress at least has the decency Keep living in this delusion. Godhra started because a train of women, children and men were burned alive by your fav victims. Why did you burn women n children alive and expect no backlash. Cry a river dog. Lol, mUh bAcklAsh 🤡🤡🤡 By that logic terrorists attacks are also “bAcklAsh” for your raping and murdering, what a fucking moron. Fucker was crying why I’m calling him a rapist murderer when he’s making excuses for rapist murderers 🤡🤡🤡 Modi se puch le Why don't you ask him, he's your dad after all. Fucking moron. Mauritius too I saw this one. Felt a bit weird. I thought I was poorer These statistics fail once you start counting the number of cars on road. Is that surprising for you guys, India had lower per capita gdp than sub-saharan africa till 2016 : [https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/IND/SSQ](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/IND/SSQ) Wait what? How much does a 4 bhk cost in a Tier 1 city? Nigeria isn't in the same league as Botswana and South Africa. It has a per capita GDP of only $1100. Most of India is closer to DRC than SA/Botswana. Per capita GDP of UP is $1300. Bihar is even lower at $925. That puts them in the same league as Gambia, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania etc. The two states have combined population of approx 40 cr, which is roughly one third of entire population of African continent. Lmao, MMS was in more of a technical position during the reforms. The real political maverick who made the transition was the then PM PV Narasimha Rao. It's fucking pathetic what the Congress party did to the guy who liberalized India. South Africa is in decline in the last decade, the trends there are alarming. Botswana is doing good yes. In Mumbai? A 4BHK easily costs upwards of 3.5Cr and I am talking about Western Suburbs not even South Mumbai. In South Mumbai, it would cost more than 6Cr. Cities like Bangalore Delhi and Pune are definitely cheaper than Mumbai but still considerably expensive. A 4BHK would cost 80L to 1.5Cr depending on the area. > Most of India is closer to DRC than SA/Botswana That's not really a good comparison tbh. You can't really directly compare the gdp per capita in DRC, Nigeria, Gabon etc to UP and Bihar because these countries get most their revenues from Oil exports, which they then distribute among the elite. So it's not like the citizens are earning the amounts mentioned. Otoh poor people in UP and Bihar get a decent amount of welfare from government schemes sponsored by richer states which don't show up in the gdp per capita calculations. We haven't seen stats for 2024 in BD. Bangladesh was going in a good direction but is unfortunately looking at a potential state collapse after the ousting of Hasina. > SEA or East Asia doesn't have problems like these Bro most western countries have literally sanctioned parts of China for slavery. Where are similar sanctions for India if your claim of widespread slavery has real merit? Having low wages for voluntary employment is not slavery, it's just poverty. >but similar per capita incomes suggest similar quality of life for an average Indian and an average person in Sub-Saharan Africa Except your own statement says that SSA is in a lower classification compared to India? Also, if you notice, most of the middle income countries in SSA are major oil producers the revenues coming from oil in these countries are exploited by a few which is why they have faaar higher inequality compared to India. The oil resource curse also makes prices high which means that even if incomes are higher, the expenses are higher too. This map gives a better idea of actual living conditions. The issue is that the state gdp per capita that the video is stating (even if true and current). Does not account for welfare and transfers. Neither does it account for the relative safety and agglomeration effects provided by the state being a part of the Republic of India. So while states like Bihar might have gdp per capita close to that of Congo, it doesn't mean that it's civilians live in the same amount of squalor since they receive rations and other benefits. It also doesn't mean that they live their lives in fear of local warlords or foreign companies massacring and enslaving entire villages. Furthermore, since there is free movement, Biharis who want to improve their incomes are free to move to other states/cities, same is not true for people in the Congo. Come on, the Naxalite situation is on it's last steps the situation was never as bad as the current conflicts in SSA. A *lot* of SSA is extremely unstable right now Sudan is facing a civil war and famine that will kill millions, Nigeria's south is basically in a permanent state of conflict, Ethiopia just got out of a bloody civil war and is probably going to be back in one again soon. DRC, Congo, Chad and many other are essentially in anarchy with the government having little to no control over the actions of their militaries, warlords and foreign militias. Security situations in India and SSA are incomparable. The cumulative amount released to UP including Finance Commission Grants, CSS etc is approx 1.2 lakh crore annually or Rs. 4800 / $57 per person annually. That's not accounting for indirect subsidies like food rations through FCI. Or subsidized natural gas, electricity, and fertilizers. The amount I mentioned includes everything, even the subsidies provided through central implementing agencies/PSUs. Source: Parliamentary Question Reply Do you have an actual source? You are wrong, the actual number is 98.5%. Dang that's low. Though, since it is total aid, it's probably $80-100 going to poor families while the rich get none. India doesn't need to be defamed it comes out just by saying the truth As per your source, Personal income tax constitutes 28% of direct tax revenue (the first graph), the 0.8% earning more than 50L per annum contributing 42% of personal income tax amounts to just 11.7% of direct tax revenue. That's just how progressive tax systems work?! You got any source on that? It is a survey of earners, dependents usually don't get counted in such surveys, but a source would be good to clarify. Aalsi hoon (I am lazy). Got it. (Prapt hua) No. Got it (Samajh gaya - understood). Prapt hua means you received a physical object (close to 'received it' or 'Paytm par 100 rupaiye praapt hue' which is the standard sound from the paytm device). I was kidding. (Mai bacche kar rha tha) Chal fir sahi hai (Come, it is right). Okay I see how a salary of 30 lacs would be insufficient now. Damn there are levels to this. >the 0.8% earning more than 50L per annum contributing 42% of personal income tax amounts to just 11.7% of direct tax revenue. You're clubbing corporate and individuals collection together. I should've clarified earlier 0.8% paying 42% personal income tax. You can check the per capita income of india to begin with. >As per my rough calculations, it is coming about 72000 per month per person Official statistics state India's per capita income as around Rs 11000 in 2020, increasing to Rs 15,330 per month per person. With your Rs 72,000 rough calculation, why don't you apply for India's Chief Economist post? Since you are not aware, that calculation was based on IMF numbers. Here’s the [link](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-sees-indias-per-capita-income-almost-doubling-12836092.html) And since you lack common sense, I’m educating you on how I arrive on this 72,000 figure. (2730*80*4)/12. Yeah comparing Nigeria and India via google maps, you can see Nigeria has dirt roads everywhere. Only on Papers Ayoo what, even Iraq Cuba Uzbekistan Ukraine Belarus Botswana Namibia are doing better than us? That kinda ruined my mood. Every country has a different history, bro. They might not necessarily be doing anything better than India except they have had different historical trajectories. India's per capita income grew at a snail's pace before 1990s. Get this bro. This is how India's per capita income grew in the 28 years between 1962-90: In 1962: $310 In 1990: $529 That's a growth of 2.5% per year. Now here's what the growth looked like in the next 28 years: In 1990: $529 In 2018: $1871 This is a 9% per year growth. Why the increase in growth rate? India may have become independent in 1947 but it became economically liberalized in only the early 1990s. Maybe some of the countries you are talking about became economically liberalized way before India and hence they are doing better than India. Maybe they had more money to start with in the first place, like I said it depends on their history. True, we cant dismiss the history and the background of these nations. Also it helps that most of the countries that seem to us should be peforming worse than India actually have lot less people in it. Namibia or Uzbekistan for example. Income inequality is quite wild in our country too. Anything measured per capita will show India a lot worse on that metric. But it's no surprise that with same population numbers, China somehow catapulted itself to new highs and providing a better life standard to its average citizen. PRICE does extensive household consumption and income survey, and according to their data, annual average household income in India (for 40th to 60th percentile group) was 2.7L (2011-12 prices). Converting to 2023 prices using CPI, which almost goubled, gives around Rs 45,000 average household income per month, nothing close to 72,000. It's not a surprise. If the poor of this country continue to produce children like sub saharans without and family planning they will remain like sub saharans. Income inequality is a problem in many places. In fact a lot of countries have a higher Gini index than India, America for one. Per capita income will always remain an imperfect measure of quality of life, but nevertheless a very powerful one. This is based on “interviews” and people generally tend to underreported their earnings a lot because of their fear of IT department actions even if everything is said to be anonymous. Surveys account for such biases by asking the same question from several perspectives, recording consumption, redundancy etc. They literally state the methodology on their site. Also, you are overblowing tax fears. Median income family with single earner earning 2.7L is still tax free. Even if they earn black money they wouldn't pay anything substantial as tax. 3L to 7L is just 5% tax. Most of this nonsense is driven by your biases and the fear to accept that India indeed is quite poor. Barely 8% households have car. Even households with 6-8 lpa have car. 10% income will be like 35-40k pm. Not like 25000"
