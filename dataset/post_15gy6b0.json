    "selftext": "So, current population of india is 1,429,770,258 (from worldometers.info). The 1% of which is 14,297,702. According to this article, the total amount of money the 1% have is 14,297,702*1.44 Cr INR = 20,588,691,715,200 INR = 247.25 billion USD.( As today's usd/inr price is 82.77). The national net wealth of india was estimated to be 14,225 billion USD (2021, from wikipedia). Taking 3.3 trillion usd and 3.7 trillion usd (gdp of india in 2022, and 2023) and adding it to national net wealth comes out to be 21.225 trillion usd.\n\nSo, {(1% netwealth) / (national net wealth) * 100} gives percentage of top1% compared to india's whole wealth.\n\nThis comes out to be {(247.25 billion usd) / (21.225 trillion usd) *100 } = 1.16%.\n\nSo it means the richest 1% owns only 1.16% of india's wealth. But oxfam says 40%.\n\n***P.S. Please suggest me if anywhere i'm wrong with my calculations or data. I took the data by simply taking it from the top most google search.
