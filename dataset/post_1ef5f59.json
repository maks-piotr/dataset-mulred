Two guys and one woman, 4 kids in the back, and OP u crazy for that title.

The Kanpur police have stated regarding the matter that 'after regaining consciousness, the woman claimed that both young men were her brothers.' oi oi oi Station Incharge Ajay Mishra said, 'When we arrived at the scene, the woman was naked and intoxicated.

Additionally, the condition of the young men was not good. We took action under section 151 and arrested both young men. After the woman recovered, she was handed over to her family.'‚Äù UP is Florida of the east. Ye ho kya raha hai Uhmmm is this real..... What did i just read..... Is this headline generate by some AI ? Why were the boys arrested but not the girl ..? Might have booked them for drunk driving first. But that explains the arrest of one boy, not the other . And if you arrest the other boy for simply being drunk then they should've arrested the girl as she was drunk too True, kids were present. She deserves the punishment as well. I'll read more but as she eloped, the family played a part probably. Read that she lived alone, had fight with her husband, was toooo drunk to answer the police and all. Case must be building. These guys are cooked because they brought the car, samigri. Hit the divider. One might be let off but the driver should not. Me personally, I don't see it men getting the hard treatment and women being let off. Kids were present and who knows what built up to this. Will check out in the morning. 696969 cuz it was 3 of them What fresh hell Multiverse of madness desi version Hell is a buttomless pit dawai hai re baba I thought Bharat is the moral capital of the world So exactly who were sitting where, assuming it was one guy driving?

Beautiful ü§£ü§£ Brand new statement r/titlegore /that's just how headlines are Exactly my thoughts. POSCO should be applied on all and all of them should be in jail. the woman claimed that both young men were her brothers...is UP the Alabama of India as well? PeAk uP Every three words the headline takes a major turn Florida is UP of the west The end of the world. This is not even a reputable news article, the ‚Äòjournalist‚Äô is bringing their feelings and views into it. Regardless- the driver should have been more careful. And who in their right mind brings kids to watch adults have sex. We all been there. Driving home with the kids, pick up a buddy and a gal, and start a threesome in the car. Just a regular tuesday. Maybe grab some drive thru. Dont stop the threesome heavens no. Its a drive thru. We got to get the kids fed and home. Ah UP, the florida of India. I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS And there is more to it The 4 kids were her children and she eloped with them. And the 2 men are her brothers. both men are arrested woman is free The men are apparently her brothers, the children are her kids. The woman refused to file complain or give medical examination. All 3 were drunk and the men are arrested Made me open the article and read it lol That's a lot of words to process It happens only in India How big a car was this??! Boom Sounds like you are saying yes she was assaulted and raped. You are aware even in more developed countries victims can not file a complaint without fear of extreme retaliation right? damn. they could have made an even crazier headline by adding the brother part LOL r/BrandNewSentence Alto üíÄ India is not for beginners Wild, UP is absolutely wild.

Idek where to start. Apparently the guys were the girls brothers. Apparently both of them are her brothers according to her statement to the police. UP = Florida + Alabama confirmed That's a lot of information to process. Too much information here to process More importantly, why did you read I feel the most horrible for those poor kids Looks like someone has surveyed the whole world and concluded that such incidents donot happen anywhere around the world Okay finally UP takes headlines back from Pune Lol we need to inform our late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam that his vision of India 2030 took a u-turn Maybe they were sitting on someone's gear stick.

No words. thanos where are you Mera desh badal rha hai Doesn't pocso apply because there were kids literally in the car who were witnessing this disgusting & potentially these crooks are involving children too? Without the accident part, it was a good plot for a p**n video. Why is there no talk about the kids? Who‚Äôs kids? Why were the kids? Ahhh this needs a Netflix episode bro Well, thank you for not texting and driving What was on episode 5689957? there's so much to unpack here You just need substances in your blood, then Anything is possible anywhere. Vikas Dubey's car flipping incident üíÄ Multitasking Or more like 696 That sounds like an orgy not a threesome R/brandnewsentence Dude it gets worse, those kids were her children, and those 2 dudes were her brother. The car ride was when she was getting eloped Ye to fucked up hota ja raha hai.. double fucked up.. Like literally what the heck have i read Can someone explain it to me? In details?? Like so I can visualise what happened inside.. Bc kabhi b reddit kholo to UP/Bhinar ki aisi atrangi news dikh hi jaati h For people like these we get \"spit and roast\" by foreign media. TMI bro didnt need to know this shit, cant deal with the headline alrdy plus bacche leke aaye ye log bc who brings kids on an orgy shit in a moving car. POCSO* By brothers you mean cousin brothers. Right?? That is why OP wrote the first letter of every word in uppercase Fools like you exist only in India. Now come on, prove me wrong by showing similar fools anywhere else in the world! :) This meme will be a fine addition to my collection. BKC ye ky padh liya The article says the men and the woman were allowed to go..? Wtf? I have lost faith yet again in the law of our country. They endangered children, had sex in front of them which should be punishable by child abuse laws, were 'driving' under influence, public indecency, and then there's another case to be made whether it was consensual on part of the woman. This is just insane Alabama = UP Hmm, ch\\*t ka chakkar, maut se takkar, quite literally! [UP man gets bitten by snake on every Saturday](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seven-times-in-40-days-up-man-bitten-by-snake-every-saturday/articleshow/111707789.cms). Read the article at your own risk.. I didn't had a reasonable guess of what the next word could be while reading this headline. I guess the kids wanted sex education in the vehicle. What is the issue? If you find a remedy, kindly let me know Who was driving? Was there a separate driver other than the 2 guys and the girl? Don't tell me one of the guys was driving!! They thought they were Lannisters Ahahahahahaha this has to be the wildest news ive read today Cool üòé Crank - High Voltage R/nottheonion Seems like a r/brandnewsentence > The police said that the boys and the girl were drunk. They were drinking and were engaging in physical relation while the car was moving and the accident occurred. The height of shamelessness in that there were four kids onboard the car and they were having sex in front of them. *\"The height of shamelessness\"*.... Love the colloquial narrative! Yahan BJrang dal kuchh nhi bolega. India is the Florida of the world istg. Omg. Can't imagine what was going through the driver's mind Literally me after seeing this article: Say whaaat noah get the boat! From another thread: Apparently, they were her brothers???? > \"Let it be known that the woman fled from Gonda with her four children.

Or ho kya raha hai humre desh mae....har roz kuch nah kuch ajjeb sa headline padta hu Yep Everyday I wake up, I see post on UP not as good news Another reason to buy a car with good leg space! After reading this, my respect for Thanos has increased to 100% now. For a moment I thought it was an onion article These people should be executed for having s*x infront of children n making their future hell. People like them are the reason for spoiling the generation n future of India too. Taking UP to a whole new f-ing level! Heh funni Real What if it was 969 Wait. 4 kids were in there in that tiny ass car while their guardians were having a threesome ... Where did they do it bro in the front ?? What ???

Worked in a village in UP and I swear to God I walked in on a bhabi spreading her legs for her devar. Disgusting and traumatizing. Never again. The amount if sexual harassment I faced there was also extreme. Is this sarcasm? News have got so weird. r/notthepyaaz It progressively got worse wtf. A sad day to be able to read . With each word this headline gets more and more crazier.... Apparently they were also related??? hamara Kanpur to kitta aage badh gaya be Link? bhabhi=brothers wife? and devar means ? sorry i dont understand hindi She most likely said they were her brothers to make it look like they weren't doing anything sexual, drunk people aren't very good with excuses. Any man older than you is casually called bhai, so yes not a real bhabhi but every woman is a bhabhi for you I agree, south Korean steel should get all these retards back on track I hope the children were too young to understand what just happened :/ A threesome on a speeding car while drunk. Thats bad enough. But also there are 4 kids in the back. I only have 2 questions 1: what the fu*k 2: what car allows for so much space. > car hits divider ah fuck > as drunk youths that explains it > perform threesome with woman inside speeding vehicle huh?? > in presence of 4 kids HUH???????? > in UP's kanpur well that explains it Quite expected, with all the lack of laws and shame. \"Control, we have an inebriated person here..\" \"Copy, who's inebriated?\" \"Considering what I'm seeing here, it might be either me or everyone else in my line of sight.\" - conversation between Kanpur police officer and control room, probably Muslims hai ? North is the UP of the South. Kalyug next stage kalyug bro Are we sure the woman wasn't being r@ped ? Given this is UP, Its very highly likely! Who were those kids? Where were they performing \"the act\"? How was everyone seated???? Why don't they give us crucial information the damned media UP is south of the north Thought the exact same thing Sure, i think getting the neuralink implant will help by automatically blocking this shit Zava zavi Bro seriously Wo 2014 mey hi patha chal Gaya tha Or bloody amnesia. I need to have an accident first i think its a bloody made up news.. it doesnt make any sense. The article doesnt say the deal about kids like whose kids were they.. and that too 4 kids.. bloody nonsense As i kept reading the heading Bruh.. What? WHAT? WHATTTTTT THE FUCKKKKK? Take the kids from them ASAP Each word added to my trauma ! Do lund lekar bhi bail mil gaya ‚òï Everywhere I go, all I see is Lord Alto Ssshhh. The universe isn‚Äôt ready for this now. The best I can do is COSCO ü§ì Someone said they were also related?? How about stop the vehicle and do it aaram se? Seems simple, right? RIGHT? Plural of youth is youth but I guess there is no excuse to have kids around during threesome and that calls for absolute condemnation!! /s Video kaha hai paka wo record kr rahe honge video kha hai What the fuck Bhabi - brother's wife. Devar - Younger brother in law. What are you high on? Good plot for porn with 4 kids in the back. Can you imagine the damage this can do on those young minds? You must be very sadistic to think this was a good plot for anything One of those 3 adults should be held responsible for putting those children through this. No one cares about what they were doing to each other and they are already fined for doing it in public place. But who is responsible for those kids?

I was in India when that poor girl was raped on a bus just because she was out with a husband Indian men thing that is immoral so they gang raped her What a disgusting culture of men. I wish they would stop migrating to Australia and piercing on our young girls . They disgust me . Where we are? In HELL? like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? threesome in car? in front of kids? 4 kids? UP?
