Its not like it is improving anyones life there will be talks about increasing reservation and that is not happening. If this clown really wants to be seen a national leader he better start acting like one and talk about pan india issues out side of i think the cowbelt the caste politics is very different it is not scst vs the high caste it is every caste from high to low against every other caste.

        "He understands politics well, at least his advisers do. Caste census is not related merely to SC/ST votes, but the much larger OBC votes too. Together the backward castes would be easily greater than three fourths of the population.\n\nEarlier he was just talking up minority politics, and all the religious polarization he was aiding in publicizing, and in some instances generating, would as anyone with a brain understand favor those on the side with majority numbers. Basically he and his party were sowing, or in some instances growing a polarization that BJP sowed, and BJP was reaping the benefits. Minority politics was the stupidest thing congress ever did (other than family policies) in its existence.\n\nNow with backward identity politics, he is trying to appeal to a much wider audience including SC, ST, OBC (this includes minorities too). While with minority politics he wouldn't win even seats in double digits with 100% of their votes, in this case he has chances of taking it all if succeeds. Basically congress is going for majority politics based on caste/class in opposition to BJP's majority politics based on religion. It is the only clever thing congress has done since 2014.\n\nAnd no, caste politics is not the worst thing in Indian politics. It is bad, but only as bad as religious politics or any other form of identity politics.",

Now only way to defeat them is showing people that they aren't committed to their right wing ideology and once you show that gap, you expolit it against them.

As long as you preserve your caste with endogamous marriage, caste will remain, caste supremacy will remain and so will the need for reservation.

I am not opposed to reservation but atleast give it to those who actually need it. Someone with multiple cars , lots of land isn't backwards. If you consider that backwards just because of his/her surname , you're just biased to the advantages of reservation. Meanwhile you ignore the actual poor and middle-class URs who suffer. \n\nDon't forget this system is creating even more hatred ( look at IITs ) between the reserved and URs. \n\nThe rich won't marry into poor and middle class if that's what you're thinking. Not every marriage is arranged. Sorry my father fell in love with someone from UR. Next life I will make sure to be someone from reserved surnames.",
        "Bruh, please justify why 0.4% of marriages in India are inter caste. Please justify why there is not a single dalit SC judge and why more than 90% of HC and SC judges are upper caste (mostly Brahmin). Please justify why even after 70yrs of reservations, there has never been a single dalit cabinet secretary (highest ranked bureaucrat in govt.). Please justify why 95% of senior management in Indian media houses is upper caste. Please justify why 95% of businesses are run by upper castes. Please justify why 100% of manual scavengers are dalit, 100% of garbage collectors are dalit. Please justify why even today, almost all abuses in most Indian languages are centred around lower castes, from kamina to chapri to chamar to kanjar. Upper castes are probably not more than 15% of Hindu population in India yet have a chokehold on all the levers of power. \n\nPlease understand the concept of generational privilege and try to gain some actual understanding on why and how reservation is essential and helpful. \n\nMoreover I see people commenting about merit. Can you please tell me how much merit is in private medical colleges? Please tell me the merit in management quotas and the rich buying seats in med schools. You don't have hate for it, because your own people can access those. You hate reservations because that's something neither you nor your kids can access. \n\nYou hate caste system, good. Then do something about it. Marry a dalit. Ensure that most marriages in your family is intercaste. Check your friend circles, how many dalits/tribals are your friends. As long as you keep marrying in your caste, caste feelings will remain and so will Brahminism. Break the cycle, do better than your previous generations, else this will continue, simply coz the numbers are not on your side.",
        "How are you determining who actually needs reservation? Reservation is not a poverty alleviation programme. It is not so that poor people can become rich. Reservation is a programme to ensure adequate representation to people who have been kept away from education and positions of power for at least 2000 yrs by your forefathers and your brahmincal ideology, which you still cling to. \n\nThe hatred is taught to us in our houses from birth. When the names of caste are used as abuses in our households (kamina, chamar, chapri, kanjar, etc) what else can be expected. You feel hate, because you think they have something which rightfully belonged to you, because they are getting an \"easy\" way, while you don't.\n\nAlso can you feel the jealousy in your sentences about the few rich lower castes in your school/colleges. Everyday you see 1000s of lower castes collecting garbage, cleaning gutters, disposing dead bodies but you don't feel the same amount of pity or sympathy for them. \"Those people\" being poor and oppressed is expected, its the way of the world. You feel sad at their plight and use it to tell yourself that you are a \"good person\". But when you see the rich Dalits, rich SCs you feel hate and anger. Ask yourself why? Shouldn't you be proud that out of millions of SCs, these few made it to the top. Shouldn't you feel happy that due to reservation, their kids and grandkids will be able to break the vicious cycle and pull more Dalits out of poverty and oppression?",

Urban middle classes are too concerned about cultural issues (Hindutva) and Pakistan. They don’t care that youth unemployment in India for college graduates hovers over 40%. Nobody gives a shit about this. Kaushik Basu (a person who is labeled a congress stooge) regularly writes about economic issues and Indians just shit all over him calling everything fake news.",
        "It’s the only thing that can unseat the BJP, unfortunately. Nobody in India cares about real issues. UCs and urban middle class care ahour hindutva and lower castes and poor care about reservations and freebies",
        "> OBC vote \n\nbro OBCs do not care much about this census and all maybe they do in Bihar but I'm a OBC myself most OBCs are absoloutely fine with the current system and dont want any change and most dont feel oppressed by the UCs so they have no reason to leave the BJP who they think is reuniting the religion",
        "Ask any lower class benefiting from reservations. Will they agree to be removed from reservations once their community gets a certain amount of representation? Will the Meena community let go of reservations now that so many IPS/IAS (I think roughly 5-10% are from Meena community alone) \n\nThey won't because reservations are not about representation anymore. It's about being given a permanent crutch.",
        "Lol if I gave you more reserved seats for jobs and college wouldn’t you take that deal? I would",
        "Money is the answer as to why there are less inter caste marriages. Parents of a girl/boy will arrange the marriage to another house with a similar amount of wealth as them.\nIt's easier to know about the wealth when you are marrying a very distant relative(meaning your caste).\nI am not saying one should only marry within their caste, i was just pointing out the reason.\n\nSecondly if a dalit girl has a similar amount of wealth as my family then I will marry her.\n\nMy neighbours are Dalits and have okay amount of wealth. They have a business of footwears. We have a very good relation and there was navratri so the girls from the neighborhood were invited as well for Kanya puja.\n\nAs for the abuses, how come upper caste is responsible for something like that when you said it's only 15% of the population?\n\nBhai agr 15% log kuch gaaliya de ya fir 85% log kuch gaaliya de to sabse jyada awaaz kiski hogi? Sabse jyada gaaliya konsi side degi.\n\n\nAs to why power is always in upper caste people's hands, the answer is simple, their ancestors misused their position and created a power/wealth hierarchy. After the constitution their power has been reduced but not the wealth hence why we still see them in power because in today's world money can buy anything even people in power(political figures).\nBut saying all upper caste people are wealthy or powerful is a very bad thing. Just 1 or 2% maybe.\nAlso don't forget this is the reason why reservation is given.\n\nWhy do we(I am not UC) oppose reservation, the reason is simple it hasn't benefited anyone or very few people instead created discrimination against general categories some of the castes included in UR category don't even have anything to do with oppression.\nWhy do children who don't even discriminate against other, are discriminated for belonging to general category by government? \nI get it that they are privileged but will their upcoming generation remain privileged if they keep getting discriminated by government.\nSecondly, only 1 or 2% people in India are privileged only not all upper caste or UR category.\n\nReservation has become a form of appeasement and discrimination instead of a tool/way of upliftment to fill a large power gap among different castes.\nHence the reason why opposing the reservation.",
        "Because that's how a country works ? Your taxes pay for you and your children's benefits ?",

        "Well depends on the facts. Why the fuck are you so scared about them ??\n\nIf it means reserved class is doing well or is not proportional then reservation benefits should be cut.",
        "Reservation benefits will never be cut. \n\nIf the facts say that the oppressed classes are doing well, they will only increase reservation and benefits, claiming that it was only these privileges that helped them. Also, the oppressed classes are usually politically powerful. The influential among these classes will become even more powerful politically and will only work for the benefit of their communities. \n\nIf the facts say that the oppressed classes are doing badly, it will be used as a excuse for more reservation and benefits. The influential among the classes will continue to be so. \n\nEither way, it's not going to end well for equality.",
        "Is your idea of equality about equal misery or equal prosperity?",

Remember this dude's minions kept a countdown clock in Gujarat expecting Congress to win there? Come down from your high horse Lucky I managed to immigrate to America that's all I can say Caste census, the fear of upper castes. Not sure about the caste census. People from those communities can give a better answer! But I agree with the notion that we need a census! It's been more than 10 years since we had one and a lot of things are being shoved aside by this procrastination. We need stats to see tangible numbers of our population and promises, policies be made on basis of that. He should be taking about important issues like Adani, Qatar death sentence, inflation, China and other things he simply doesnt understand politics if he wants only SC/ST votes then this is a good stratergy but you need more than that to win elections and what is he going to do with the caste census, anyway ? Its not like it is improving anyones life there will be talks about increasing reservation and that is not happening. If this clown really wants to be seen a national leader he better start acting like one and talk about pan india issues out side of i think the cowbelt the caste politics is very different it is not scst vs the high caste it is every caste from high to low against every other caste. Caste politics is the worst thing in modern politics of the country it was importnat back in the days but not today Maybe he means a decision by the cabinet I won't argue supporting it but I really want to know if there's any other realistic, not idealistic, way in which the bjp can be defeated No, we need 150% caste reservation in both private and goverment sector. It's time for us in India to evolve. just backwards To rule you need to divide Fanbases are always fanatic >He should be taking about important issues like Adani, Qatar death sentence, inflation, China and other things >he simply doesnt understand politics Not sure if you've been following but he has tried all of them You talk about economics and internal issues, you defeat BJP. You talk how things are still controlled by big Babus, why Industrialist's have so much wealth. You don't even need to think that hard, you talk about pain points in people's daily life, people will resonate, but he goes to foreign university and talks only of freedom of speech and what not and that too in English. Normal people are like, ye kya bol raha hai, kuch samazh nahi ata. Isse acha Modiji hai kuch kuch samajh ata hai, desi dikte hai. Even Bharat Jodo he just walked, instead of just walking, you stay with people with and observe and then speak up. But nope, it seems like he is campaiging for BJP. I don’t get it, how’s it free when tax is hiked? Because he himself is involved in all of this, he carries too much of a historial burden of his family. They took a soft policy on china, inflation was horrible during 70s, their own goverment is dealing with Adani in big projects, so it makes him look like a hypocrite. Now when Mauha moitra talked about Adani, it got media attention as she was deemed independent, but when it blew up, she lost all her credibility in one go. The guy has been chanting so much of your first point since 2019 that I'm sick of it. No one thinks like how you said infront of religion, pakistan etc And that's why I will not vote for Congress Nice You give him a proper telepromter, a proper speech in Hindi and see how it pans out. You go one district to another. He always go for the PM but discuss on people. You remeber when he said suit boot ki sarkar, the goverment went silent in 2018-19, not much reaction on that. So you need to have a consistency to get through people. And obviously when it comes to Religion and Pakistan they win, but when Pakistani cricketers was welcomed, why Congress didn't criticise them, they could have used it and said, how can you welcome them with such arrangements when you army personnel are killed. Why host match in the largest stadium, why did you guys called up pakistan journos and gave them visas to cover the match. They could have countered pakistan point with cricket but they didn't and they will miss Qatar point this time too. >but when Pakistani cricketers was welcomed, why Congress didn't criticise them, they could have used it and said, how can you welcome them with such arrangements when you army personnel are killed Sorry but that's just laughable yeah, still, they need to reduce cost of private schools and colleges or they need to work on improving quality out there why? Just ask the UR candidates to give up and do something else. What's the point of reservation in post grad entrances? Only vote bank. Indirectly accepting that even graduating is useless. BJP vs Congress has become \"Choose your poison\" - Increased Reservation or Increase Hindu nationalism Yeah just ask the UR candidates to give up and leave the country if they can , if not just do something else like labour or open shops. Already crossing 50% mark (if you count ews) , and a few states have more than 50% reservation. CG was also considering more reservation. MP Congress also openly saying they'll fuck the UR asses if they come in power. If you're a UR middle class guy , at this point it's just hopeless. Yeah day by day I am regretting not giving USMLE or PLAB and move out of this place. So you're happy with more reservation? only if BJP makes a mistake or there has to be strong opposition basically a strong personality who can oppose modi or yogi Exactly man. Just when I was fed up of BJP and was liking the new congress , they do this shit. The reserved people already have so much benefits it's unreal. Bruh please justify having reservation in post grad exams lol Half my college reserved people are ultra rich , they get full ride free , plus extra cash , laptops and on top of that they have reservation for pg entrance You give the same exams as us in college , score the same passing marks in college exams , but somehow there is still reservation for PG entrance. Even becoming a doctor is not enough. Reservations for pg exams are for Representation in the society. Your point of reserved category people being rich has nothing to do with reservation as already many of the pg doctors are from upper caste due to domination in the society by the UCs Congress keeps BJP in power. FFS! While I don’t like caste based politics at all: do you really think if he talks about adani the media will cover it? No media is independent in India right now. Why’re people downvoting this comment? Most govt school don’t even have teachers to teach, of course they need to improve govt schools. >they need to reduce cost of private schools Just ban private schools. Na rahega baans, na bajegi bansuri. You can't, you need to improve Goverment school to incetivise people to actually go there, not just banning things and forcing goverment approved on education. That party will lose all the support of the middle class. It's just a caste census to make a picture clear of how different sections of society has progressed. Will help to understand which sections need to be worked on. It's a basic type of operation to do before working on any task. No idea why some folks are getting scared because of it. Is there something that they don't want to be found out or what? He understands politics well, at least his advisers do. Caste census is not related merely to SC/ST votes, but the much larger OBC votes too. Together the backward castes would be easily greater than three fourths of the population. Earlier he was just talking up minority politics, and all the religious polarization he was aiding in publicizing, and in some instances generating, would as anyone with a brain understand favor those on the side with majority numbers. Basically he and his party were sowing, or in some instances growing a polarization that BJP sowed, and BJP was reaping the benefits. Minority politics was the stupidest thing congress ever did (other than family policies) in its existence. Now with backward identity politics, he is trying to appeal to a much wider audience including SC, ST, OBC (this includes minorities too). While with minority politics he wouldn't win even seats in double digits with 100% of their votes, in this case he has chances of taking it all if succeeds. Basically congress is going for majority politics based on caste/class in opposition to BJP's majority politics based on religion. It is the only clever thing congress has done since 2014. And no, caste politics is not the worst thing in Indian politics. It is bad, but only as bad as religious politics or any other form of identity politics. Reservation isn't about bank balance. Ye my lord BJP deserves another five years rahul is not ready to take the Reigns of the country right now he shall sit in opposition for another term to learn the basics of poltics In India, even liberals hold anti-reservation sentiments, and are unabashedly casteist (I am not saying you are). Which I find pretty hilarious (also sad). Liberals in India will raise their voices against Islamophobia (as everyone should), they will also tall about how we shouldn't be focused so much on Paskistan (makes sense). But for whatever reason, they hold cheap sentiments on castes and reservation. Holy fuck! You people are buffoons. How will a caste based census divide the nation? Say it louder for the nicompoops in this thread. Casteist assholes believe that the people from reserved categories are being treated much better than others. And not just that. They also think that the \"General\" category peeps are being punished. Lmao. UR guys should now start selling Cucumbers in the train as profession This very sub will be the first one to term it as ridiculous behaviour from cong and will be back to the same \"they shouldn't be doing this\". Tiring after 7 decades people are finally gonna see, INC follow divide and rule policy of British.... the wheel of time is the ultimate master. I aint scared man, i wish congress does it I wish congress increase reservation to \"jitni abadi utna haak\" I will love it if congress makes Bharat, Hindu Rashtra Passes a bill that frees temples from govt control, Brings UCC because Majority wants it, Imposes Hindi over entire nation kyuki hindi bolne walo ki toh abaadi jyada hai na And brings back Old pension scheme, humko bhi chahiye retirement ke baad fixed and assured income ;) People still talk about this party? Is this the best opposition we have? If it is then expect bjp to rule 2-3 more decades sub isn't India, and i know people who would have supported it. The only way to remove bjp is to outplay them. BJP has occupied space starting from Right to center and now trying for the left wing space, but isn't sucessful. Now only way to defeat them is showing people that they aren't committed to their right wing ideology and once you show that gap, you expolit it against them. That's how politics work, sad thing is that no one in congress is thinking about this basic, even if they are they are not doing it Then stop giving it to well to do people You are thinking. If you fall into the category of people who vote for congress, you are probably not someone who thinks. Woah bro kucch bhi lmfao There is UG entrance reservation 2hich guarantees representation in college... After college everyone becomes a doctor. They pass the same exams with UR. The neet pg exam is for pg seats and if being a doctor is not social upliftment after passing 6 years at equal force with URs then I don't know what is. Would I like a doctor who scored 300/800 to get the same seat some guy had to score at 600/800 ? Jesus. After mbbs it is about skills and knowledge not anything else especially while handling life and death. Even that will be soon reserved with \"licenses\" Username checks out Aage kuaan peeche khai scenes. Look what Caste Politics did to Bihar. Doing it on a nationwide scale will be detrimental to the country. I hate the vitriol the BJP is spreading using the Hindi-Hindu narrative, but using caste census and reservation as a counter to that is fucking moronic. Lol who'll pay the teacher's salaries? Some private schools are on really prime location who is going to buy them? And how are you planning to reduce the cost of government schools And good luck ever wining an election ever again. People tend to forget that Middle Class Exists. Man just say you are so neurologically handicapped you need a fucking government to prop you up , I’d say skill issue Cast assholes need entire governments to lift up their handicapped asses I mean, it's the job of the government to uplift the population. I am not sure what you wanted to point here lmao. Yes Keyword THE Population not A PART of the Population. Understand context , oh wait did I expect too much from you ? Did that hurt whatever remains of your brain ? I am so sorry dude :( cost of private schools or improve the goverment schools, not the other way around Lmao! What even are you talking about! Providing reservations (based on caste and gender) is going to uplift the whole population, not just those groups. That's how uplifment is done. You wouldn't expect government to give benefits to Ambani and his keens, would you? Wtf is cast assholes lmao. We're you trying to use a slur, but chose not to! Well how many marriages in your family with well to do dalit families? As long as you preserve your caste with endogamous marriage, caste will remain, caste supremacy will remain and so will the need for reservation. If you hate reservations, get your kids married into dalit families, caste will disappear within a couple of generations. Ambedkar recommended this almost a 100 yrs ago, but brahminists will do anything to preserve caste including letting their kids suffer. He exactly spoke about adani in parliament and he had paid a huge price for that. He also repeatedly speaks about inflation , never heard him against gas and petrol prices?? Joke is on you because you don’t want to listen to him. You are only interested in godi media which is paid not to show him and hide modi adani loot Those well to do dalit families need even more help to become even more rich and get top positions in govt? Wow good idea. I am not opposed to reservation but atleast give it to those who actually need it. Someone with multiple cars , lots of land isn't backwards. If you consider that backwards just because of his/her surname , you're just biased to the advantages of reservation. Meanwhile you ignore the actual poor and middle-class URs who suffer. Don't forget this system is creating even more hatred ( look at IITs ) between the reserved and URs. The rich won't marry into poor and middle class if that's what you're thinking. Not every marriage is arranged. Sorry my father fell in love with someone from UR. Next life I will make sure to be someone from reserved surnames. Bruh, please justify why 0.4% of marriages in India are inter caste. Please justify why there is not a single dalit SC judge and why more than 90% of HC and SC judges are upper caste (mostly Brahmin). Please justify why even after 70yrs of reservations, there has never been a single dalit cabinet secretary (highest ranked bureaucrat in govt.). Please justify why 95% of senior management in Indian media houses is upper caste. Please justify why 95% of businesses are run by upper castes. Please justify why 100% of manual scavengers are dalit, 100% of garbage collectors are dalit. Please justify why even today, almost all abuses in most Indian languages are centred around lower castes, from kamina to chapri to chamar to kanjar. Upper castes are probably not more than 15% of Hindu population in India yet have a chokehold on all the levers of power. Please understand the concept of generational privilege and try to gain some actual understanding on why and how reservation is essential and helpful. Moreover I see people commenting about merit. Can you please tell me how much merit is in private medical colleges? Please tell me the merit in management quotas and the rich buying seats in med schools. You don't have hate for it, because your own people can access those. You hate reservations because that's something neither you nor your kids can access. You hate caste system, good. Then do something about it. Marry a dalit. Ensure that most marriages in your family is intercaste. Check your friend circles, how many dalits/tribals are your friends. As long as you keep marrying in your caste, caste feelings will remain and so will Brahminism. Break the cycle, do better than your previous generations, else this will continue, simply coz the numbers are not on your side. How are you determining who actually needs reservation? Reservation is not a poverty alleviation programme. It is not so that poor people can become rich. Reservation is a programme to ensure adequate representation to people who have been kept away from education and positions of power for at least 2000 yrs by your forefathers and your brahmincal ideology, which you still cling to. The hatred is taught to us in our houses from birth. When the names of caste are used as abuses in our households (kamina, chamar, chapri, kanjar, etc) what else can be expected. You feel hate, because you think they have something which rightfully belonged to you, because they are getting an \"easy\" way, while you don't. Also can you feel the jealousy in your sentences about the few rich lower castes in your school/colleges. Everyday you see 1000s of lower castes collecting garbage, cleaning gutters, disposing dead bodies but you don't feel the same amount of pity or sympathy for them. \"Those people\" being poor and oppressed is expected, its the way of the world. You feel sad at their plight and use it to tell yourself that you are a \"good person\". But when you see the rich Dalits, rich SCs you feel hate and anger. Ask yourself why? Shouldn't you be proud that out of millions of SCs, these few made it to the top. Shouldn't you feel happy that due to reservation, their kids and grandkids will be able to break the vicious cycle and pull more Dalits out of poverty and oppression? Mah man! Ain't going to vote this sh*t! Oh sorry yeah I mean how are you planninf to reduce the cost of private school? Subsidise them? 😂😂😂 He already was speaking about all this but no one cared. Like how BJP does religion politics, Congress does cast politics to counter. In Indian politics you have to do shit like this to win. Aap is an exception. Why does he want to divide the Hindus more and more with caste census? I don't believe in any caste. I'm Hindu. Caste census is not for benefits it's just for finding facts. It’s the same with all parties. Fu. Just because you don't doesn't mean it's not there. Ridiculous And then do what with the facts? I don't see any motives behind this caste census other than vote bank favouritism of numerically and politically dominant communities. Based. it will just lead more us vs them type situation. Politicians can weaponize it. regional or identity politics. You are talking to smug entitled people who have hardly stepped outside of their bubble, or tried understanding people outside their bubble. Buffoons is labelling these pricks mildly. > The reserved people already have so much benefits it's unreal LOL I am surprised at the power of what Whatsapp university can do. I am very liberal lol. Support LGBT rights, marriage, don't care what people eat even though I am a vegetarian. Don't care about caste and all. But when I gave JEe I had only 36% seats available for me rest all were reserved so agar reservation 20% bhi badhta hai it's better for GEM to just die then I guess par tum kaha samjh paoge. You equalise subsidy. Lets say you have 100L as budget for education and 10L students so per student it is 10. SO which ever school the student joins, the school will recieve 10 and will reduced from the fees. In the budget you seperate fund allocation for infra for goverment and you have a equity in the system. That even if you want to send you kid to private school but can't meet your ends, goverment will assist you just like it had when you were sending the kid to goverment school. So parents have more options financially and not bound to only goverment school. > I don't believe in any caste. I don't believe that British oppressed Indians. I'm a Hindu. Fuck them, they are propagating systemic inequalities. > Yes Keyword THE Population not A PART of the Population Haha, it's governments job to uplift a part of population, apart that was marginalised like lower caste, women, and poor people, etc. It's a fundamental right - article 16. Government doesn't function in the whims of your stupidity. I'm from general category, I've seen only less intelligent general category kids who didn't have ability to get into good college blaming reservations on social media, instead of improving themselves. So what? I'd let him divide the Hindus more and more? Never. I speak only what I see. True unfortunately. I dont think you understand OBC, im an OBC and we generally do not fall under the oppressed people like the scst. Hindus are buying the religion above caste concept and that had united the upper caste and OBC because as i said unlike scst most OBC do not think of themselves as being oppressed by anyone and most are regionally powerful so they most likely are not going to giveup on higher religious cause for caste issues. And you highly exxagerate the effects of caste census, no one outside of cow belt is going to care much about it if congress was in power and the qatar, adani, petrol price, china issues were to be happening people would be on the streets. bjp politicians would not let the government off the hook if it meant going to jail then so be it. congress lacks that no congress person will be willing to sacrifice anything for the party Start including dalits in workforces. Savarnas barely constitute 10-15% of the population yet they occupy close to 100% of any position of power. It's a simple question of representation. If caste census happens , India will be more divided than ever and any slight dream of being a developed nation in next 40 - 50 years will also be lost forever. There would be brain drain and economic migration of humongous levels and efficiency of government bodies will be drastically affected. The voters are doing it. Choose the lesser evil between the Hindu-Muslim riots or Upliftment of the oppressed castes/people. Choose well for the countries sake. The ED action against them states otherwise. Choose the lesser evil between the Hindu-Muslim riots or Upliftment of the oppressed castes/people. Choose well for the countries sake. > He should be taking about important issues like Adani, Qatar death sentence, inflation, China and other things Look beyond what the godi media shows you. > BJP has started a new thing,” he said. “Modi ji says, wherever he goes, that he works for backward people and OBCs. You (Modi) use the word OBC everywhere, then why fear an OBC caste census? Because you know OBC people are poorly represented (in the government). You know this reality and do not want the OBC youth to know this.” He doesn't want to divide hindu, he wants them to have proportional representation. Upliftment? Or appeasement? Improving their condition or vote bank politics? To 'uplift' certain castes should I totally ignore the inequalities towards the 'unopressed' castes. I am all in for reservation but not in its current form, where a person despite being well off can have easier competition just because they're from a oppressed caste. Yes, BJ Party's soft Hindutva politics and communal politics is horrid, but atleast they have achieved some level of development. Road infrastructure has improved, global image has improved. Yes I dislike them to the core, but I dislike increasing reservation more. The general caste (especially general males) already have it so bad, just because they were born a general male, is it not discrimination against general caste in the name of reservation? Ambedkar himself did not want reservation to continue for as long as it has, we talk about eradicating caste lines however reservation itself plays a great role in deepening those caste lines. And all for what? Just because our fore - fore - fore - fore fathers were unjust to lower castes? Have we not paid their dues in the last 100 years? If the current model of reservation is changed to a purely economic condition based, then Congress can have my vote. Just glad that I'm out and this shit ain't my problem no more. >Reservation is a programme to ensure adequate representation to people who have been kept away from education and positions of power for at least 2000 yrs by your forefathers and your brahmincal ideology, which you still cling to. But why would you create another layer of pseudo UC within Dalit community? Check ST reservations. A huge portion of the seats in every exam are cornered by Meena community while other ST communities are lagging behind. The person who cleans our toilets are from the lowest SC class but his family is never able to benefit because of the powerful SC communities. Reservations have created a creamy layer of Dalit communities which prevents the other communities from getting ahead. Increase reservations to 70% but why would you not want to introduce a creamy layer? Why would you not want the son of an IAS officer to get the same reservations which their parents and grandparents already availed? All I am saying is equalise cut off marks and keep the tuition fees exemption for reserved candidates. Or are you saying reserved candidates by default have a much inferior capacity at intellectuals tasks ? Bloody clown. Reverse Apartheid-ing your nation isn’t a solution towards equality. At this point I am just a third class citizen compared to you. As for Btechtards , why ? Afraid I’ll speak the Truth ? 30-50% percentile pipsqueaks getting admissions into NIT only to mess around in college , get addicted to girls and drugs and later graduate with a 5 cgpa ? Only to get recruited by the state banking institutions where they can barely do the task they’ve been assigned but they end up getting a solid salary at the end of the month despite being unable to differentiate between magnetism and electromagnetism? No dude , you are not going to convince me. I am a firm believer of a Authoritarian Technocracies. What’s wrong in having a caste census? I think if you were able to emigrate to the US then you wouldn't have been affected by any caste census. Look, I'm not necessarily a fan of reservations. But I work in an office job in the private sector. Almost everyone is upper caste. Imagine how much of an 'invisible reservation' that creates. Ya Right....Dream on.... Issues in the reservation system need to be ironed out. The solution isn't eradication of reservation. No system is perfect but this is easily the best way to brute force representation since savarna society refuses to change. Its strange how afraid people are of data. Choose upliftment of the worthy. Not just SC ST vote dude it’s OBC vote. Those three together can keep you in power forever. Congress, an upper caste bastion for an eternity, is not grasping at straws to claw its way back to power. It could work! Hahah for the new generation it has become virtually impossible to move to America permanently without either becoming a professor or marrying an American Economic arguments won’t unseat the BJP at all. The poor care only about their immediate needs and about their immediate community so freebies and reservation is what they get out of bed for. Urban middle classes are too concerned about cultural issues (Hindutva) and Pakistan. They don’t care that youth unemployment in India for college graduates hovers over 40%. Nobody gives a shit about this. Kaushik Basu (a person who is labeled a congress stooge) regularly writes about economic issues and Indians just shit all over him calling everything fake news. It’s the only thing that can unseat the BJP, unfortunately. Nobody in India cares about real issues. UCs and urban middle class care ahour hindutva and lower castes and poor care about reservations and freebies > OBC vote bro OBCs do not care much about this census and all maybe they do in Bihar but I'm a OBC myself most OBCs are absoloutely fine with the current system and dont want any change and most dont feel oppressed by the UCs so they have no reason to leave the BJP who they think is reuniting the religion Ask any lower class benefiting from reservations. Will they agree to be removed from reservations once their community gets a certain amount of representation? Will the Meena community let go of reservations now that so many IPS/IAS (I think roughly 5-10% are from Meena community alone) They won't because reservations are not about representation anymore. It's about being given a permanent crutch. Lol if I gave you more reserved seats for jobs and college wouldn’t you take that deal? I would Money is the answer as to why there are less inter caste marriages. Parents of a girl/boy will arrange the marriage to another house with a similar amount of wealth as them. It's easier to know about the wealth when you are marrying a very distant relative(meaning your caste). I am not saying one should only marry within their caste, i was just pointing out the reason. Secondly if a dalit girl has a similar amount of wealth as my family then I will marry her. My neighbours are Dalits and have okay amount of wealth. They have a business of footwears. We have a very good relation and there was navratri so the girls from the neighborhood were invited as well for Kanya puja. As for the abuses, how come upper caste is responsible for something like that when you said it's only 15% of the population? Bhai agr 15% log kuch gaaliya de ya fir 85% log kuch gaaliya de to sabse jyada awaaz kiski hogi? Sabse jyada gaaliya konsi side degi. As to why power is always in upper caste people's hands, the answer is simple, their ancestors misused their position and created a power/wealth hierarchy. After the constitution their power has been reduced but not the wealth hence why we still see them in power because in today's world money can buy anything even people in power(political figures). But saying all upper caste people are wealthy or powerful is a very bad thing. Just 1 or 2% maybe. Also don't forget this is the reason why reservation is given. Why do we(I am not UC) oppose reservation, the reason is simple it hasn't benefited anyone or very few people instead created discrimination against general categories some of the castes included in UR category don't even have anything to do with oppression. Why do children who don't even discriminate against other, are discriminated for belonging to general category by government? I get it that they are privileged but will their upcoming generation remain privileged if they keep getting discriminated by government. Secondly, only 1 or 2% people in India are privileged only not all upper caste or UR category. Reservation has become a form of appeasement and discrimination instead of a tool/way of upliftment to fill a large power gap among different castes. Hence the reason why opposing the reservation. Because that's how a country works ? Your taxes pay for you and your children's benefits ? Sorry were you ever treated differently in school or colleges. Also Idk even know which surnames are general or OBC. Most of the kids and people are unaware. So stop crying. Lol even the liberal UC's getting rattled by the promise of a caste census. You guys are just like the 'civilized' European elites of the 19th and 20th centuries. If Congress comes into power in 2024 I would certainly regret not going abroad to study Look at what caste politics did to Bihar and tell me you want that for ue entire country Well depends on the facts. Why the fuck are you so scared about them ?? If it means reserved class is doing well or is not proportional then reservation benefits should be cut. Reservation benefits will never be cut. If the facts say that the oppressed classes are doing well, they will only increase reservation and benefits, claiming that it was only these privileges that helped them. Also, the oppressed classes are usually politically powerful. The influential among these classes will become even more powerful politically and will only work for the benefit of their communities. If the facts say that the oppressed classes are doing badly, it will be used as a excuse for more reservation and benefits. The influential among the classes will continue to be so. Either way, it's not going to end well for equality. Is your idea of equality about equal misery or equal prosperity? Politicians will then know who to appease. Only the electorally-relevant communities will be favoured, while the others get pushed to second-class status. I don't know you but I'm happy for you. I should have left when I had the chance, feeling bad about it now. Hope I get an opportunity. Ask the “eat the rich” people. Ask the people saying “why does government help big businesses” Systemic inequalities are promoted by land \"owners\". They can't produce anything of value, but they squat on the space productive folks could use to create value. Introducing a land value tax can help. Read up about it if you're interested. Worthy by being born in some privileged caste? That's the de facto reservation that got us into this shit, and the de jure reservation is trying to correct it. [Bihar census identified the privileged and under-privileged castes. Go national now](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/171ebvq/bihar_census_identified_the_privileged_and/) > if Economically Weaker Sections, a sub group of the 15.5% General category, can be given 10% quota, why limit 63% OBCs to just 27% quota? > Upliftment? Or appeasement? Don't get carried away by politicians trying to create a \"us against them\" rift. Bruh .... politicians are not creating a 'us against them' rift. They are just using them as a vote bank, and if they can stand for their rights, so can I. Now I am certain that Rahul Gandhi is a BJP mole. Seriously how can someone be so stupid? BJP has already lured half of Hindu population with its propaganda and is pretending to create caste less Hindu Rashtra. Congress could use sensible issues like Inflation, Manipur issues, Unemployment, Monopoly of some corporates, PM cares, Brij Bhushan case and many more. But no, Congress want caste census and prove BJP right that Congress is dividing India. Worthy by being the best person for the task. We see people with 0 marks in entrance test becoming teachers in govt schools, destroying the future of the country."
