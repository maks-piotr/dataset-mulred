        "Mole is a quantity, just like 1 dozen is 12. It is a very big quantity, so we use it to measure the number of atoms in x grams of a compound.\n\n1 mole = 6.022x10^23 atoms/molecules. (6.022x10^23 is called Avogadro's constant)\n\nThere are three formulas to find the number of moles:\n\n1. No. Of moles = given mass/molar mass\n\nEx. Find the no of moles in 54g of H2O.\nH = 1 amu\nO = 16 amu\nSo molar mass of H2O = 2x1 + 16 = 18 amu\nNo. Of moles =54g/18 amu = 3 moles.\n\n2. No. Of moles = given no. Of molecules/Avogadro's constant \n\nEx. Find the number of moles in 3.011x10^23 molecules of H2O\nNo. Of moles = 3.011x10^23/6.022x10^23 = 1/2 moles\n\n3. No. Of moles = vol of gas (in L at stp)/22.4\n\nEx. Find the number of moles in 11.2 L of CO2 gas.\nNo. Of moles = 11.2 L/ 22.4 = 1/2 moles.\n\nHope this helps.",
