That too not in Mumbai. Kudos to you!\n\nNot only am I interested in partnerships, I'm actually interested in working with a trusted network of directors and writers from across India. My aim is to create very low-budget indie stories which have great distribution potential and OTT watchability. And therefore I'm looking at young directors and writers who believe in innovation, jugaad and above all, not a Kapoor or a Khan if you get what I mean. \n\nIn fact, I'm going to form a tangible working Reddit Indian writers' community soon for support, script discussions, business discussions and other discussions about filmmaking in India.
