    "selftext": "Hello, fellow Redditors!\n\nI hope this post finds you well. Today, I am reaching out to this amazing community for urgent help and support. A dear feline friend is currently in critical condition and is receiving treatment at Crown Vet Hospital in Kalyani Nagar, Pune. We are a group of college students who found this poor kitty in dire need, and we cannot afford to cover the entire hospital bill on our own. We are kindly requesting your assistance in the form of donations, no matter how small.\n\nCat is in critical condition and is admitted , she is eating food so that's a good sign . The hospital bill has reached  around 18k\n\nThe veterinary team at Crown Vet Hospital has been exceptional in their care, providing round-the-clock attention and treatment. However, the expenses have started to accumulate, and it's becoming increasingly challenging for us to manage everything alone.\n\nWe understand that times are tough for everyone, but even a small contribution can make a significant difference in saving this precious life. Every penny donated will go directly towards covering the cat's medical bills, including surgeries, medications, and other necessary procedures.\n\nHere's how you can help:\n\nDonation Options: We have set up a donation fund through a reliable platform [UPI] to facilitate easy and secure transactions. [Siddharth -8421799102]\n\nShare and Spread the Word: If you're unable to contribute financially, that's absolutely okay. We would be immensely grateful if you could share this post with your friends, family, and other communities. The more people who see this, the higher the chances of reaching our goal.\n\nMoral Support: Your words of encouragement, prayers, and positive vibes are also valuable to us during this challenging time. Feel free to leave comments and messages of support.\n\nWe will make sure to keep everyone updated on the cat's progress and the utilization of funds. Transparency is of utmost importance to us, and we will provide all necessary documentation upon request.\n\nThank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to read this post and for considering helping us. Together, we can make a difference and give this cat a fighting chance at a happy and healthy life.\n\nTL;DR: A cat is hospitalized at Crown Vet Hospital in Kalyani Nagar, Pune. We are college students unable to afford the entire medical bill. We kindly request your donations, no matter how small, to help save this cat's life. Please share this post if you're unable to contribute financially. Your support means the world to us!",
