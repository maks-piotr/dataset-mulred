        "unless u were living under a rock, it's an old scam..nobody falls for it nowdays they are super stupid that is.\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/man-receives-rs-150-after-liking-youtube-videos-ends-losing-rs-40-lakh-in-the-online-scam-2406421-2023-07-14",
        "I'm receiving quite a lot of these and it's becoming annoying.",
        "how would you like to take your payment sir?, \numm.. i think gpay or ppay will do., \nokay sir. please click on the link which i am sending you to receive your payment. ,\nokay sure.  *clicks* , \ndear customer. xxx69 rps deducted from your account.",
        "This is not even a scam. People would fall for it only if they are just too stupid to be true !",
        "It's a money mule scam. You'll get money, but you'll also have your bank account locked due to the amount of money they'll have you transfer.",
        "Just do the task and get 150 Rs and don't need to pay any money to her",
        "This person will ask you to do free tasks, such as liking YouTube videos or reviewing Gmap locations. They will then connect you to a \"receptionist\" on Telegram who will ask for your bank details, such as your name, account number, and IFSC(this is completely safe to share as many companies, NGOs, and government departments have them publicly available), After providing your information, the receptionist will transfer 150-300 rupees to your account.  \n\n\nThey will also ask you to join a Telegram group, which is where the scam begins. In the group, there will be other people who claim to have earned a significant amount of money through this group and will keep on doing that. This is done to entice you and make you greedy.  \n\n\nAfter another task that earns you around 100 rupees, they will ask you to send them 1-2 thousand rupees, promising to send you the amount plus a 33% bonus within 30 minutes. However, the outcome of this scam varies. Some scammers may simply take the 1-2 thousand rupees and block you, while others may continue stretching the scam until you eventually send them a much larger amount, such as 30-40 thousand rupees.  \n\n\nIt is important to note that by participating in this scam, you will be sharing personal information, which raises privacy concerns. It is unclear whether they verify if the shared information matches your bank details.  \nAdditionally, it is unlikely that someone can hack into your bank account by only knowing your account number and IFSC details.  \n\n\nPlease be cautious and avoid engaging in such scams.",
        "What world are you living in that you don't know about the youtube like scam? It's like the scam of the moment!",
        "There are many such people, like yourself.",
        "Best to stay away from such messages. \n\nThey will send you money, but it's money they have themselves earned from scams, etc. Hence, if someone complaints, all bank accounts involved  get blocked. \nThey themselves will get money from 3rd party for increasing like count of certain videos. So you end up screwed. \n\nAnother way is they will ask you to pay for entering such schemes. So it is best to stay away.",
        "Does that even work any more? \n\nYou'll have to enter your password in order to send the money. On top of that GPAY warns you that this link is used to send money to someone. On top of that it issues an extra warning if the amount is huge.",
