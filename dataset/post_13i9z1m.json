        "Interesting question, as it changes, but I‚Äôll go with Wildcard because:\n\n- the chorus is super catchy\n- it has really diverse musical elements: Indian, jazz, big room EDM and they all blend quite nicely\n- there is irregular / chromatic musicality in the second verse especially\n- the drop goes mental whenever I play it live",

        "In the whole music making process, which part is the most enjoyable for you?",
        "I spent a lot of time after seeing Gully Boy getting acquainted with rappers in India and Stan's name was unavoidable. I listened to the whole Insaan album and realized there was something very special about him... So I asked my team to link me up and we booked a session. It was only one day but we managed to get through two songs and he was a very sweet, kind person. Very open minded",
        "Is the other mc stan collab a commercial one like this one ? I wish it's lyrically better",
        "Karam is a concept album, and it has a story that we learn through the interludes: we‚Äôre told of a poor boy who forms a gang and rises to power. For each song on the album, I invited the artists to choose a moment in our character‚Äôs journey and use that as inspiration. Each song reflects the boy's karam (deeds) and, by the end of the story, he can't escape the consequence of them",
        "Do you recommend me to buy dharma worldwide subscription as I have only basic knowledge in music production? \nCannot wait to see you in Poland this year, it feels like a dream came trueüáµüá±",

        "You killed it at the production btw",
        "My process is this:\n\n\\- Layout the goals, what new types of sounds I want to include\n\n\\- Get a talented group of producers together in a house who record drums and instruments, and do sound design\n\n\\- Spend weeks in studios with instrument players from around the world\n\n\\- Add new sounds and process existing ones for 1.5 years or until my hair falls out\n\n\\- Swear to myself I'll never make another pack again\n\n\\- Repeat",
        "Just smile if krsna is there in Album üòè",

        "I think all artists find the question \"what was your inspiration for \\_\\_\\_\\_?\" to be very.... uninspired\n\nBut in the case of KARAM I guess it goes back to Gully Boy, when I became very excited about the HH scene in India. And my interest in hip hop goes back to the very beginning of my interest in music",

        "Hey KSHMR! I can't contain my excitement for your upcoming album Karam! The anticipation is real. Also Haath Varthi is an absolute banger!! Here‚Äôs a couple of things I‚Äôm curious to know- \n\n1. What was the most memorable experience or inspiration that influenced your music production style?\n\n2. What's the most memorable show or performance you've ever had?\n\n3. Are there any collaborations or dream collaborations you have in mind for future projects? \n\n4.

Did you quit smoking?\n\n5.I wonder what kind of god you believe in",
        "A big part of it was my partner David leaving the group... I tried to be \"The Cataracs\" by myself for a while but soon felt it was puttering out and I needed something new. I was already falling in love with dance music and tried my hand in producing it. The truth is dance music is much diff than other genres (arguably harder) because the beat needs to really stand on its own without need for a vocal to be entertaining. But I'm so glad that I made the shift as it allowed me a lot of freedom and creativity",
        "One in particular yes :) and it's one of my favs from the album",
        "Hey Niles! huge fan here since 2015 \n\nI still listen to Welcome to KSHMR VOL 7\n\nPlease release the REEZ & KSHMR - ID (12:50 Mark)\n\nThanks for reading this",
        "The most challenging aspect was consistent transient recognition.\n\nFor those who don't know, transients are spikes in sound volume, which should signify a new \"hit\" or \"note\". Accurately identifying transients was core to the special FX in KSHMR Reverb, and it turns out that the human ear has an easier time doing this than a computer. But, in the end, we got close to perfect :)",
        "Big fan here. Just to say Hi! Found you while listening to Jammu in an Uber in Chicago in 2015. Now I blast your songs on my headphones while working in a small town in India. Lots of love! Keep rocking.",

        "Sending you love, thanks bro",

        "Do you have any advice for someone who wants to pursue a career in music production?",
        "Thank you, I can't really comment on ppl I wished to have. Not everything is 100% yet still\n\nEDM fans can expect an evolved sound, but in many ways a return to darker, more dance oriented music that I'm excited to play live -- less poppy / vocal focused",
        "Yes there will at least be a visualizer for each song. Dre has so many good beats but the one that first comes to mind is Xxplosive",

        "Hey KSHMR, First off HUGE FAN. I've been following you're music since many many years. I was super excited when I saw your name announced in the Ultra Music lineup ( Bangalore) and got the tickets as early as possible. That being said i felt the set to be underwhelming, I dont mean to cause any disrespect, the music played were amazing, but I feel i was expecting something else. I felt that the indian remixes were unnecessary because you have SO MANY songs of your own merit that could blow literally anyone away. So my question is, were you trying to cater the Indian Audience differently or were you experimenting something new ?\n\nAgain huge FAN and hope to see you again in India ü•∞üòä",
        "Hey Niles! Will the Bay Area live experience show that got canceled come back? Was looking forward to it, so I'm hoping another one comes through!\n\nOn another note, as a producer, is there any sounds or music tracks from movie soundtracks or video games that you've sampled from?

        "Thank you for everything you've done for the community and huge congratulations on your new releases. Your music is something someone remembers over a lot of tracks that sounds like just noise to me. I'm an audiophile from India and I love to deep dive into different styles of music to increase my creativity as a dubstep lover. I know you are a producer nerd who works all day and night to make sure that your style never goes out of time. I have a long list of questions only if you could take the time to answer but I hope wherever you are, you are going to inspire. \n\n\n1. How do you approach using sound design as a tool to create a sonic landscape in your music? What are your thoughts on using microtonality and exotic scales to achieve ethnic and dark sounds?\n\n2. When you start working on a track, which part of the arrangement do you usually begin with? Do you have any specific techniques or approaches to structuring your compositions?\n\n3. Could you share your best tip for arranging a track effectively? How do you ensure that the different elements in your arrangement work together cohesively?\n\n4. When it comes to writing melodic structures, what is your approach? Do you have any techniques or strategies that you find particularly useful in creating captivating melodies?\n\n5. With your diverse taste in music, how do you manage to handle various influences without getting overwhelmed? Do you have any methods or mindset that help you maintain a sense of cohesiveness in your work?\n\n6. When working on a track, how do you determine when it is finally done? How do you satisfy yourself and know that you've achieved your desired sound and arrangement?\n( answer these in any manner or sequence you're comfortable with )",
        "Hey KSHMR! Big fan here.\n\nI've been producing big room and free style EDM tracks for a year now, but I'm facing a challenge. \n\nWhenever I try to create a melody or verse, it ends up blending with existing melodies in my mind.\n\nHow do you craft your melodies and find inspiration for unique ones like the ones in your big room tracks? \n\nI've put in a lot of effort, but I haven't been able to create catchy melodies like yours. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!",
        "I am saking the same thing here i think he should reply",
        "We know that in your album \"Harm√≥nica Andromeda\" each song has a small story that in general all together tell only one. My question is, what is the story that the songs \"Dusty Fairytale, Slow, Tupinamba, You Don't Need To Ask and Come to life\" tell us?",
        "Very Interesting. Although being pure American of Indian descent, he drew inspiration for his name from his grandparents and named his stage name after the state of J&K. His dad immigrated from Kashmir to the US who's a Kashmiri Brahmin. \n\nI wonder if he did that during the forced exile of Kashmir refugees. If that's the reason for his son's stage name then KSMR has true respect for Kashmir's history.",

Next Song of Karam Album In which month we can expect to hear the whole album\"Karam\" When can we see track list of the upcoming album? You mentioned \"the discovery of new sounds\" as your favorite part of music. Can you give an example of a new sound or technique that you've recently discovered and incorporated into your work? Yooo Niles! Loved Haath Varthi!! When are you releasing the whole album bro? Also any potential collaboration with Ritviz in the works? Tracklist of karam album? You were also a huge inspiration for my track 'Brahmastra'! Would love to get your opinion on it :) Hi. Been a fan since Cataracs days. Missed you in Bombay. Any chance you're coming back to India for one fo your shows? How many songs are there in the album? My guess is 13-15 and When you are dropping the track list. How did the collaboration with MC Stan come about, and what was it like working together on 'Haath Varthi'? Coming for sunburn this year? Frankly I got nothing to ask, but I think this is the best moment I've gotten yet to get noticed by you. I just wanted to thank you, from your sample packs to your tutorials to your podcasts and especially your songs have helped me and probably million others to even start making music. It's been 5 years now, I don't think there's been a day of making music where I havent chosen a sound from the sounds of kshmr sample banks. Hope to match your levels one day, working everyday to my make dream a reality. Thanks once again. Lots of love from Mumbai. Also I hope I can meet you one dayüò≠ lmao started fan boy-ing heavy. Hey Niles, Any plans on coming to Sri Lanka? Loved your last album even bought myself the vinyl üòä Expecting a banger album Love from Sri Lanka Nothing to ask, but we'll collab in future. I will be the next big thing in DHH for sure.. Best of luck for your 1st DHH album 'KARAM' WHEN IS KARAM COMING OUT ???? You've recently launched your own record label, Dharma Worldwide. What inspired you to start your own label? BRO WHY DIDN'T YOU INCLUDE FRAPPE ASH (1/2 HALF OF A DUO NAMED FULL POWER IN WHICH YUNGSTA IS ALSO A PART OF) IN YOUR ALBUM KARAM. RN HE IS TOP 5 DHH ARTIST AND YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIS DISCOGRAPHY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING !! I can see that you are on Reddit for 7 years! So let me ask some Reddit-based questions : 1. How did you discover Reddit? 2. Which are your favourite subreddits 3. How popular is Reddit with your industry peers ? 4. Is MC stan on Reddit too ? :P hey, a huge fan of your work. Looking forward to your next album with desi rappers featuring my favs 1.my question to you is for how long were you working in the album and how was the whole process while interacting with rappers and exploring a new genre diffrent from what you usually do 2. How do you discover all the DHH rappers and who are your most favorite ones 3. I remeber you tweeting about krsna's say my name and talking about him in afaiks podcast. So can we expect a song in the album with him and was the whole vibe in studio as both of you are KPs and share a similar background... Only coming there if you are there ! You've been very open about your struggles with mental health in the past. How has music helped you cope with these challenges? Can we expect a collab with young stunners in future? Many DJs and producers have a specific moment or song that sparked their interest in electronic music. What was that moment for you? Was there a specific track or artist that made you realize this was the path you wanted to pursue? You've held a high place on DJ Mag's Top 100 DJs poll for several years. How does it feel to achieve such recognition? And how does this recognition influence or put pressure on your creative process? Hey KSHMR, I have to know: how was it to experience the wild success of Like A G6?! you couldn't go to a single club in in the 2010s without hearing in multiple times a night, and it still goes hard to this day Hey KSHMR, Can we expect some drill tunes with DHH artists from you ? Big fan of all you‚Äôve created in these years, putting India on the map. Love the story concept of the upcoming album Karam. Question- How did you feel working with artists that rap in Hindi(no offence, but a language that you haven‚Äôt got the best grasp on)? Was it difficult in the sense that you weren‚Äôt able to fully understand the meaning behind their verses? Be on the new skrillex album kshmr How do Karam and Harmonica Andromeda differ in terms of influences along with your progression as an artist from then till now? You have performed at numerous music festivals like Coachella, Tomorrowland, EDC, Ultra, and Sunburn. Can you share some of your most memorable experiences from these performances? Hello KSHMR, How can a music producer in India grow right now and is there a way to send you beats or melody to get collabs with you? Also love your track Voices it's my favourite. Apologies if you get this question often but will the 8-bit versions of a few Harmonica Andromeda tracks ever see the light of day? I remember you mentioned it in an interview and it had me super intrigued with what it would sound like lol Can you talk about your decision to transition from being part of The Cataracs to becoming Kshmr? What led to this change, and how did it affect your music? Your collaboration with Tiesto on \"Secrets\" was a significant hit. How did this collaboration come about, and what was the process of creating this track with such a renowned artist? Hey kshmr.... Big fan of ur works ... I'm a jee aspirant and wannabe music producer at the same time... I'm at 12 th standard currently and there is unbearable pressure all around me ... Which mainly includes living upto the expectations basically... But I don't wanna leave behind the passion of producing music...as you stated in the documentary that your grandfather wanted you to be a professor or MBA like ur father... But you still managed to get into music...my question is...how did you convince yourself to come into passion in spite of that career pressure exerted by ur elders? are you performing this years tommorowland? Harmonica Andromeda has a very unique sound. What inspired you to create such a diverse range of genres in this album? First of all i am a huge fan of yours ,I was thinking to make a artwork for you ,where can I send it to you when it's complete? ye melody itni chocolaty kyun hai sir ? Yo Niles First of all Congratulations for Haath Varthi , it's trending at #1 on yt music I wanted to know if there's some artist that you wished to have on Karam , apart from the ones who are already a part of it ! Also what can your EDM fans expect after the Hip-Hop album ....like your artistic approach towards a particular genre Are there some pending collaborations with other edm producers ? If yes with whom ? Thank you :)) Hey KSHMR, First of all a Big Thanks for this AMA. And coming towards my Questions. 1. How did you bring these many DHH Artists together for the Album? 2. When is the tacklist gonna drop? Eagerly waiting for KARAM!!! Will there be visuals for each song on the album? Like there was for HA? Also what is your favourite Dr. Dre beat? Would love to know! I‚Äôve gone with the Sony WH-1000 XM series (they‚Äôre on 5 now I believe) Q) Are we going to get a tracklist of KARAM or singles gonna drop one after another ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è Music production on haath varti was phenomenal üôå Hey KSHMR, Some people say that we're just copying west's hiphop culture without adding something new or Indian element to it. What's your take on that. Btw best wishes for your Upcoming Album. And don't release more snippets from the album. Yoo, KSHMR, i have been listening to your work for the last 2 years, you're absolutely crazy at music production, ekdam mast. HAATH VARTHI's music part ü´°. I'm hyped asf for your album KARAM, in the recent live on IG you've mentioned that track list will not be out soon, also the album will be out within 3 months as you've mentioned too; I've three questions:) : 1. When can I or any folk who is hyped asf can expect the complete tracks list, within a month? Also how's your experience working with DHH artists, did you have any plans on picking specific artists for this album? 2. Gonna rap again? 3. Hyderabad kab aaraheyy ho? Midnight lion walk, blood in the water üõê I'm actually listening to \"around the world\" now, coincidence at its best, hehehe. Will we be witnessing a KR$NA X KSHMR in KARAM How many songs are gonna be there in the forthcoming 'KARAM' album? Hey #kshmr Big Fanüôå of you & your style of doing Music from the time of Cataracs, **1 Question i am asking in every insta live you do:-- will you ever drop that Remix Song which had a Saxophone melody( you showed on üì∑insta live, you also showed 'Bruk It Down' & 'Get With Nobody' on that live) Next track ? Hey KSHMR, big fan and much love to you. When will you do a Collab with Martin Garrix? yep! i own those since last year. they don't fold up but that's not an issue for me, i like their design Man with your desi hip-hop coming in a few months , I feel so regretful that Sidhu Moose Wala isn't here today with us ! Would have loved to see you 2 work together:( Could we get to see you work with some Punjabi artists like Diljit, Shubh etc in future ( ik you've got one track Riar Saab and I'm super excited for it as well ) Interesting question, as it changes, but I‚Äôll go with Wildcard because: - the chorus is super catchy - it has really diverse musical elements: Indian, jazz, big room EDM and they all blend quite nicely - there is irregular / chromatic musicality in the second verse especially - the drop goes mental whenever I play it live More info will be out sooner, but I would say a full one in about 6 weeks Hey kshmr i love you so much man just wanted to know will you ever release flutes away cause we have been waiting for so long What role did Represent play in your album? Not a question but Album launch idea, do a live stream on samay's with all the artist hour before the release play games n shit or whatever that will engage people n will hype people right before release ‚ù§ How did you get so many rappers on the album? KSHMR huge fan!! When are you coming to Hyderabad? Since the last show of yours was cancelled due to COVID. \\- are you ever going to make a shift back to your electro/big room house roots? \\- what's the best part about using ableton (as far as i know, this is your DAW of choice), and if you used any in the past how was your user experience with them / why did you drop them? \\- did you learn/study any musical education? how'd you get into music in the first place? \\- have you been to australia or malaysia before? \\- who are your inspirations? big fan of your style and filling of the niches btw, keep it up ! Love your music Wow thank you so much! Tell the people running events there to book me :) no plans as of yet Unrelated but, Samsung S23 ultra vs iPhone 14 Pro Max Hey KSHMR i am a big fan of yours and you are my favourite producer/dj. My question is that would you be trying to produce new genres of edm like bigroom techno or maybe uplifting trance since these two are really popular right now. Love your work can't wait for the full album and other songs ! Saw you at feedingindia mumbai last December. Great music! >I‚Äôve gone with the Sony WH-1000 XM series (they‚Äôre on 5 now I believe) I have the same one. They are so good with sound quality. 8 microphones too I think. In the whole music making process, which part is the most enjoyable for you? I spent a lot of time after seeing Gully Boy getting acquainted with rappers in India and Stan's name was unavoidable. I listened to the whole Insaan album and realized there was something very special about him... So I asked my team to link me up and we booked a session. It was only one day but we managed to get through two songs and he was a very sweet, kind person. Very open minded Is the other mc stan collab a commercial one like this one ? I wish it's lyrically better Karam is a concept album, and it has a story that we learn through the interludes: we‚Äôre told of a poor boy who forms a gang and rises to power. For each song on the album, I invited the artists to choose a moment in our character‚Äôs journey and use that as inspiration. Each song reflects the boy's karam (deeds) and, by the end of the story, he can't escape the consequence of them Do you recommend me to buy dharma worldwide subscription as I have only basic knowledge in music production? Cannot wait to see you in Poland this year, it feels like a dream came trueüáµüá± What does your name mean? You killed it at the production btw My process is this: \\- Layout the goals, what new types of sounds I want to include \\- Get a talented group of producers together in a house who record drums and instruments, and do sound design \\- Spend weeks in studios with instrument players from around the world \\- Add new sounds and process existing ones for 1.5 years or until my hair falls out \\- Swear to myself I'll never make another pack again \\- Repeat Just smile if krsna is there in Album üòè Thanks. I was inspired by my own diverse taste in music, which I had previously simplified into genres like EDM and pop. In the case of HA I allowed my creativity to run free and sometimes fit multiple genres into one tune Just smile if krsna is there in Album üòè Just smile if krsna is there in Album?üòè Hi!! Are you planning on rescheduling your live set in San Francisco? Also would you ever consider doing a trance set? Any advice for up and coming artists. As someone who loves playing the guitar and hopefully good at it, I always wanted to start a band but never found the group. Is it advisable for me to start a solo project first? Any advice for up and coming artists. As someone who loves playing the guitar and hopefully good at it, I always wanted to start a band but never found the group. Is it advisable for me to start a solo project first? Any advice for up and coming artists. As someone who loves playing the guitar and hopefully good at it, I always wanted to start a band but never found the group. Is it advisable for me to start a solo project first? I think all artists find the question \"what was your inspiration for \\_\\_\\_\\_?\" to be very.... uninspired But in the case of KARAM I guess it goes back to Gully Boy, when I became very excited about the HH scene in India. And my interest in hip hop goes back to the very beginning of my interest in music How did you get the Idea of your stage name and why the place name? How did you get the idea of your stage name and why the place name? Hey KSHMR, I loved your song in Garena free fire, Any plans on tours? Who is your current non edm producer? Were you working on some track with showtek which was related to fifa or football ? Was looking forward to it Hii KSHMR a hugeee fan of your music When are u coming to Pune Id love to come to your show :) Collab with young stunners or divine when ? Recs for mixing headphones? Hey KSHMR! I can't contain my excitement for your upcoming album Karam! The anticipation is real. Also Haath Varthi is an absolute banger!! Here‚Äôs a couple of things I‚Äôm curious to know- 1. What was the most memorable experience or inspiration that influenced your music production style? 2. What's the most memorable show or performance you've ever had? 3. Are there any collaborations or dream collaborations you have in mind for future projects? 4. What advice would you give to someone looking to develop their own unique sound as an upcoming music producer? Bro when will you be in Delhi next I'm a Korean fan. I have a lot of questions. I want to know even though I am not good at English. &#x200B; 1. I'm curious about MBTI TEST TYPE. 2. Do you have a favorite Kpop song? 3. Do you have a favorite Japanese animation? As far as I know, I like Final Fantasy 7. 4. Did you quit smoking? 5.I wonder what kind of god you believe in A big part of it was my partner David leaving the group... I tried to be \"The Cataracs\" by myself for a while but soon felt it was puttering out and I needed something new. I was already falling in love with dance music and tried my hand in producing it. The truth is dance music is much diff than other genres (arguably harder) because the beat needs to really stand on its own without need for a vocal to be entertaining. But I'm so glad that I made the shift as it allowed me a lot of freedom and creativity One in particular yes :) and it's one of my favs from the album Hey Niles! huge fan here since 2015 I still listen to Welcome to KSHMR VOL 7 Please release the REEZ & KSHMR - ID (12:50 Mark) Thanks for reading this The most challenging aspect was consistent transient recognition. For those who don't know, transients are spikes in sound volume, which should signify a new \"hit\" or \"note\". Accurately identifying transients was core to the special FX in KSHMR Reverb, and it turns out that the human ear has an easier time doing this than a computer. But, in the end, we got close to perfect :) Big fan here. Just to say Hi! Found you while listening to Jammu in an Uber in Chicago in 2015. Now I blast your songs on my headphones while working in a small town in India. Lots of love! Keep rocking. In addition to producing music, you've also released sound packs for other producers to use. What inspired you to share these resources, and how do you feel about the idea of other artists using your sounds in their own work? You've launched Dharma Worldwide, a sublabel of Spinnin' Records. What was your vision behind creating this platform, and how does it align with your overall music career? Sending you love, thanks bro Thanks, that was a wild ride. It opened many doors for me and I'm very thankful to David and Dev for it... I think without that song my life would have been very different I never completed them but here are the V1s: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bwmp1ubbptsuyv3/AABYAooStnXtq25dCQ0Vw1c2a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bwmp1ubbptsuyv3/AABYAooStnXtq25dCQ0Vw1c2a?dl=0) Do you have any advice for someone who wants to pursue a career in music production? Thank you, I can't really comment on ppl I wished to have. Not everything is 100% yet still EDM fans can expect an evolved sound, but in many ways a return to darker, more dance oriented music that I'm excited to play live -- less poppy / vocal focused Yes there will at least be a visualizer for each song. Dre has so many good beats but the one that first comes to mind is Xxplosive Would have loved to work with Sidhu, very sad indeed Yes the one with Riar is a standout and I would love to work with Shubh! Watching him very closely atm They helped orchestrate the entire project. My good friend Aayushman helped connect me to all the artists and devise a plan, and Sankalp was my right hand man through each and every day. They are one hell of a team. I was helped greatly by Aayushman and the REPRESENT team, in addition to me reaching out to people on IG etc. Would love to hear about a crazy fan moment! Yea 100% there is actually a series on Dharma Worldwide where I start from the very beginning and explain the basic concepts of music production. Try it out! See you in Poland :) Kashmir Where my paternal family is from Gonna do an India tour when the album drops The other song with MC stan is Mumble or what ? 100% that would be Kontakt, I think incorporating real world instruments has been at the core of my sound 1. you 2. gotta 3. wait 4. just 5. a 6. little 7. bit 8. longer 9. my 10. friend HEY KSHMR A BIGGEST FAN OF YOURS. YOUR PICTURE IS IN MY SMALL STUDIO AS GOD, INSPIRATION FOR MAKING MUSIC. WHO IS YOUR INSPIRATION ? Hey the best way is on [www.dharmaworldwide.com](https://www.dharmaworldwide.com) in the demo submissions page We remember you bringing your Dadaji twice to the stage at Sunburn, is there any song dedicated to him in the album? Flutes Away became \"Hymn of Reflection\" on Lion Across The Field [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FmvYnFha6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FmvYnFha6w) There is no other version.. That's the one Hey KSHMR, First off HUGE FAN. I've been following you're music since many many years. I was super excited when I saw your name announced in the Ultra Music lineup ( Bangalore) and got the tickets as early as possible. That being said i felt the set to be underwhelming, I dont mean to cause any disrespect, the music played were amazing, but I feel i was expecting something else. I felt that the indian remixes were unnecessary because you have SO MANY songs of your own merit that could blow literally anyone away. So my question is, were you trying to cater the Indian Audience differently or were you experimenting something new ? Again huge FAN and hope to see you again in India ü•∞üòä Hey Niles! Will the Bay Area live experience show that got canceled come back? Was looking forward to it, so I'm hoping another one comes through! On another note, as a producer, is there any sounds or music tracks from movie soundtracks or video games that you've sampled from? Or maybe even just generally really dig? Much love üôè What do you like the most about music? BRO BRRROOO BROOOOOOROOROROROO When Niles met Kshmr zone & Welcome to KSHMR ! üëÄ Bro love the music on \" close your eyes\" that song remains in all of my playlists. Love your music.my question would be, What is your favourite Indian dish? I just want to ask, a year ago you mentioned that you would be working on a second album (not the hip hop one) that project is still alive? Hi KSHMR. I just want to say thank you for your amazing music. My brother, sister and even my mum likes your music. Always rooting for you:) I know this question is kind of shallow. But do you follow a religion? Given how fundamentalist people of Kashmir are. I don‚Äôt mean to offend you btw. Just a genuine question. Music is challenging to my mental health in many ways, but it also brings me so much joy and it‚Äôs my place to create and express myself. Growing up, listening to artists I loved was a big emotional release for me Growing up , listening to kshmr was a big emotional release for me :) Hey Kshmr what's your chess rating now? How was your experience working with Mass Appeal ? Hey Kshmr. Just wanted to know the story behind your stage name? Hey man Can you tell us about the Collab with KR$NA?? Like how you guys connected and stuff.. Hey niles , I‚Äôve been a hardcore fan of yours for a long time. Which side of yours did you actually feel you‚Äôre being yourself at its peak, is it mvi, dreamz, the old bigroom style, the indian style or your more WESTERN EDM style? Ever since you‚Äôve been into the transition to a Western EDM type of vibe, you‚Äôve massively lost your views and streams, is it safe to say that it is one of the main reasons for a KSHMR comeback to the Indian style? And safe to say you‚Äôre gonna dive more into it ? Big fan BTW tried to explain my question as thoroughly as possible :)))))) How was your experience working with armaan malik? ANDDD plans on the next producer meet in delhi pls :‚Äô)))))))) Alsu u/kshmrmusic , do you remember my username:PP Any plans on collaborating with nucleya or ritviz? Man, they both are so good. Have you heard of ritviz? WHAT BROO BHAII I WANT MY ANSWERS üò≠üò≠ Hey KSHMR what‚Äôs your plan on launching any songs with AFROJACK,i think if you both would work together then the outcome would be a greatest banger of all BTW your biggest fan wanna meet you so badly someday ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Love U KSHMR What's the one/few classic Indian instrument sounds/samples you haven't used it in any onf your track yet, that you are looking forward to use it in your upcoming tracks. Hey KSHMR please Upload full 1 HR set of ROAD TO ULTRA MUMBAI please witnessed the best set ever and to make it more rememberable we need it JAMES HYPE uploaded it Please we need yours Too I used your samples before I heard your songs, which was before I knew what you looked like haha. I see posters for festivals you play in but have never had the chance to attend your show live. Which is your favorite venue where you played? Huge fan man, keep being awesomeüôèüî• How about a collab with Pritam, i honestly want to hear what that would sound like, i believe both of you have the same workflow and vibes in music, he has a lot of electronic influence in Bollywood songs and you have a lot of indian influence in electronic music, that makes a perfect pair, Also another question, with the EDM scene evolving so fast, what are your predictions about what genre would have a massive impact in the coming time? Man i missed your AMA session. Will go through the post. You are awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è Bro shall have done the qna at Indian hip-hop heads subreddit much better What are your views on your sample packs being so popular in the K-POP industry? And do you get any royalties for those? Love your music <3 Hey KSHMR! Bigg fan since Jammu, Karate, and Secrets and have seldom missed an episode of Lesons of KSHMR. Just wanted tell you, you're such a great inspiration and just such an amazing producer. Always have been in awe of your music, the way you write it, the thinking that goes behind it and will always be. Thankyou for existing and being such an idol for me to look up to! Wishing you all the love! For the sake of asking, is there any specific genre you'd like to explore in the near future? I would not get these headphones for the microphone. They are terrible Are you vanilla Kashmir or occupied by Pakistan? Hello KSHMR . I just want to say that I love your music, it improved my music taste and expectations a lot . I have been following you since you released the single shiva and created the dharma worldwide .Harmonica Andromeda was also amazing , it was a unforgettable moment when I listened to it for the first time . &#x200B; I just want to ask that are you Dreamz and The MVI . Cus the music is so cool that I can't find similar style anywhere . I have kind of Grown out of just listening to EDM and shifted towards math rock and instrumental . But I always to listen to you irrespective of genre . You've had a huge influence on my playlist over the years . I love your stuff. I wanted to ask if your inspirations have changed as the years went by or are you still drawing from that well? What‚Äôs the history with your unreleased song ‚Äòinto the fire‚Äô? Will it ever be released? Wow it‚Äôs hard to think of an Indian instrument I haven‚Äôt used‚Ä¶ but there are so many loops in Sounds of KSHMR Vol. 4 that I could imagine making a song with. Each melody was like my baby, I love them all In puzzles: 2554 In games: 1226 Get me the old KSHMR, I wanna say Hi Great team, helped me with important decisions and to understand the hip-hop scene better ‚Äî and of course, an honor to be releasing on the same label as Nas and Divine. Yes, most definitely. After this hip-hop album I will be focusing on dance music, and there‚Äôs already a lot in the works on that side of things. Bro do a music with Don diablo Thank you! My favorite is Tandoori chicken Yes, for sure, it will mostly likely happen towards the end of the year around October. I made a remix of the Gladiator song ‚ÄúNow We Are Free‚Äù and I think that whole soundtrack is amazing. I also love John Williams, he‚Äôs just on another level. And Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu is my favorite from the video game world. FF7 >>>> I wanted a platform to put out music I love, as well as a place for producers to learn and get resources. It aligns well with my philosophy of sharing as much as I can! All my packs and tutorials can be found at Yes I want to know this one. Is it because he's an artist from Kashmir? At least I am better than you at something hahaha I would guarantee it haha too old ig He is dreamz Is there any way I can interview you regarding your new album? I am a journalist with News18.. Wow what a coincidence. Have been listening to all your tracks for last couple of days in loop. Love your work!!! No matter how many times I listen to it I never get bored. Went to your show at the end of last year in New City Gas. Had a blast. I really loved the different Indian cultural icons you showed in your projections on the screen. I smuggled some edibles in my shoe, too (in a packet ofc). Fun times. Niles really damn man. But I can't hear flutes away in that. But anyways thank you niles for answering. I saw you say this in fb Livestream bit we all thought you were confused When's ur album dropping i really can't wait for it anymore?? Btw big fan‚ù§Ô∏è Just watched the 'HAATH VARTHI' music video, it's dope man!! Video editing is top notch, I guess I have never seen such a good visual Indian music video. Your song \"Bombay Dreams\" made me realise that I had fallen in love with the love of my life. I still remember that moment, this song was newly released. I was standing by the bed listening to this song and feeling tears in my eyes, getting the realisation that i was falling hard in love with somebody :) Hey kshmr ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ big fan brother Karam album date??? I love wildcard the most too! That, Dharma, and Mandala. BRO I LOVE YOU Hey KSHMR! Big Fan here , would you ever perform in South India? if you were to step into the music industry today, what you would've done differently this time? any tips for a newbie just installing fl studio or something similar to start producing music out of curiosity and interest? Are music schools worth it? What's the most important thing to really make it into the scene as a artist? I'm a young music producer Wildcard original mix. Was my first KSHMR song and glad to say it became my favorite very fast. KSHMR CAME HERE??? Yessss mines wildcard too üß° He already told the story behind his Name in his podcast with a YouTube channel called AFAIK. Got to know you from the game Free Fire, love your songs man! Hello!! Huge fan of yours ever since Dharma came out!!! I‚Äôve used so many of your sounds for my FLPs and they‚Äôre amazing!!! I wanted to know how I could send you a project of mine that I know for sure you would love! And to make more interesting, it‚Äôs also got a little taste of South Indian music!! Will eagerly wait for your reply!!! Ping pong? You mean table tennis? Mine was Bombay dreams Thank you for everything you've done for the community and huge congratulations on your new releases. Your music is something someone remembers over a lot of tracks that sounds like just noise to me. I'm an audiophile from India and I love to deep dive into different styles of music to increase my creativity as a dubstep lover. I know you are a producer nerd who works all day and night to make sure that your style never goes out of time. I have a long list of questions only if you could take the time to answer but I hope wherever you are, you are going to inspire. 1. How do you approach using sound design as a tool to create a sonic landscape in your music? What are your thoughts on using microtonality and exotic scales to achieve ethnic and dark sounds? 2. When you start working on a track, which part of the arrangement do you usually begin with? Do you have any specific techniques or approaches to structuring your compositions? 3. Could you share your best tip for arranging a track effectively? How do you ensure that the different elements in your arrangement work together cohesively? 4. When it comes to writing melodic structures, what is your approach? Do you have any techniques or strategies that you find particularly useful in creating captivating melodies? 5. With your diverse taste in music, how do you manage to handle various influences without getting overwhelmed? Do you have any methods or mindset that help you maintain a sense of cohesiveness in your work? 6. When working on a track, how do you determine when it is finally done? How do you satisfy yourself and know that you've achieved your desired sound and arrangement? ( answer these in any manner or sequence you're comfortable with ) Hey KSHMR! Big fan here. I've been producing big room and free style EDM tracks for a year now, but I'm facing a challenge. Whenever I try to create a melody or verse, it ends up blending with existing melodies in my mind. How do you craft your melodies and find inspiration for unique ones like the ones in your big room tracks? I've put in a lot of effort, but I haven't been able to create catchy melodies like yours. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks! I am saking the same thing here i think he should reply We know that in your album \"Harm√≥nica Andromeda\" each song has a small story that in general all together tell only one. My question is, what is the story that the songs \"Dusty Fairytale, Slow, Tupinamba, You Don't Need To Ask and Come to life\" tell us? Very Interesting. Although being pure American of Indian descent, he drew inspiration for his name from his grandparents and named his stage name after the state of J&K. His dad immigrated from Kashmir to the US who's a Kashmiri Brahmin. I wonder if he did that during the forced exile of Kashmir refugees. If that's the reason for his son's stage name then KSMR has true respect for Kashmir's history. Indians are calling table tennis, ping pong now A"
