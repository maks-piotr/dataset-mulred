If any vehicles are in horizontal limb of T, they automatically get right of way. They neednâ€™t slow down for you. You should wait n only turn when there are no vehicles in the eyesight (or when you are sure that the vehicle you see neednâ€™t apply brakes because of you turning. This is for bit experienced drivers). The actual idea is that T junctions usually connect smaller roads to bigger ones (crossroads to main roads). So smaller road traffic will usually have the stop sign facing them n they should stop. Main road traffic has right of way.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes 4 road junctions may have this sign. Then vehicles coming in all 4 roads will stop at junction. The vehicle which was first to reach will then take off again. Same way 2, 3, 4 positions should take off in that order in which they reached.\n\nIts kinda taken seriously by americans. If we follow it, weâ€™ll ridk getting hit by vehicle behind.
