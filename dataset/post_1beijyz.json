Apart from this, the competition and studies have been made so tough that it is not possible to understand anything without tuition.\n\nHis fees are also no less!\n\nWe see daddy having a lot of trouble in arranging the fees. Seeing his problems, we cry a lot, many times I feel like leaving studies, but I remember what you all said that daughter. Educate, save your daughter, and if India studies, India will progress!\n\nHonorable Chief Minister, we have seen daddy selling mom's jewelery to arrange Rs 1 lakh for elder brother's admission! Because we have seen our dad doing journalism very honestly, he does not earn a single rupee from anyone through any wrong means, he teaches the lesson of honesty to us too! My dad has received respect in many places because of his honesty and writing good articles, but this does not cover the household expenses, my dad's income is very limited, in such a situation, what will he do next for my and brother's education? We don't know!\n\nHonorable Chief Minister, we want to study! The story of millions of children like us is similar to ours!\n\nYou have made many good changes in your state,\n\nWith folded hands, I request you to make some changes in the field of education so that education can become affordable for everyone.\n\nAlso end the practice of changing books every year, so that those books can be useful to the children of lower classes, and thousands of trees do not have to sacrifice their lives to make so many books and notebooks.\n\nAn ordinary girl from your state",
