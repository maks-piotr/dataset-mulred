And in one other order I had received boiled-black-burnt(alliteration?) dough in place of choco lava cake(SERIOUSLY??). It was so hard that I couldn't even cut through that shit with a knife. For the maida roti order, I asked them for a refund and after many tickets closed without resolution I posted to twitter tagging consumer forum etc. After that they refunded a 100rs coupon which couldn't be clubbed with other offers making it totally useless as most restaurants have already different offers going on. Totally done with Swiggy for now.\n\nTldr; Received incorrect items(read inedible) multiple times, got another order cancelled as the restaurant was closed. All that while being stoned. Don't use Swiggy.",

        "I think after few times they're reluctant to refund money. Earlier they used to refund without asking many questions but after few wrong orders they rejected refund requests.

I emailed them multiple times.\n\nI definitely appreciate the delivery partners and make sure to tip them whenever I can. But in my area some restaurants are running a scam like operation where they list items that they can't make. For example, there are dhabas near station which have multi cuisine listing. And they are never able to deliver. They have listed 10 types of noodles at various price points and no matter which you order, you'll always get veg noodles. Also, these restaurants have multiple listings under different names with same menu and addresses. I think this definitely can be called a scam. You rate them bad once and a new listing will pop up under same name. So Swiggy and Zomato being unable to take action against such restaurants is what was really frustrating.\n\nBut you're right that there's no point in getting frustrated over that.

In my case I was only asking for refund for incorrect items but they were asking to contact on email. \n\nI think it just depends on how often you order, and how often you request refunds. \n\nMy wife and I used to order from Swiggy and Swiggy Instamart almost every day. I have no idea how much we spent, but likely between Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 50,000 per month. Most orders went off fairly well--aside from drivers incessantly calling for directions before even reaching our neighborhood--but there'd be occasional mistakes, too. \n\nSwiggy very rarely hesitated in granting refund requests. And, when they did, I'd tell them to check how much we spent every month, and to compare that number with the value of the requested refund. \n\nZomato is another story. They really don't give a shit. Quintessential Indian customer service: extorting as much money as possible from a single transaction, without any consideration to customer loyalty. The last time I ordered from Zomato was *the last time* I ordered from Zomato--our order was royally fucked up, and they told me to contact the restaurant for a refund, lol."
