    "selftext": "I have been told that India has become a global economic powerhouse under Modi and Modinomics have failed those from Harvard and Cambridge. With Make in India and focus on Ease of doing Business and lower corruption India has entered a golden era. (Ram Rajya)\n\nBut when we look at the figures, GDP growth has been slower under Modi's 10 years as PM. India has grown at 5.8% between 2014 and 23 while it grew at 6.8% during the UPA 1 and 2 at the end of which UPA was voted out because of inflation and India against corruption movement. We can't ignore thag Modi had to face Covid but UPA had to deal with the 2008 Crisis as well.\n\nDuring BJP's rule, Unemployment has gone up. Na khaunga, Na khaane dunga proved to be an empty promise with BJP leaders caught in several corruption scams.\n\nBut I don't see any hope. Because this is \"Naya Bharat\"\n\nIt's not afraid to be proud of its achievements which may or may not be materially consequential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-hindutva-rate-of-gdp-growth-9067341/](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-hindutva-rate-of-gdp-growth-9067341/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Main issue for me is  bureaucratic hurdles didn't get simpler, its prohibiting SMBEs so much as a result hurting the economy, social issues are leading to around 4% loss in GDP too.  Startups are having so much trouble in scaling up as well due to overregulation. There hasn't been much investment in education while India has a large young population. India was overregulated during UPA, under Modi its weirdly underregulated and overregulated at the same time which is prohibiting higher growth rate.",

        "Pretty sure the global economy was hit harder by 2008 crash than COVID. And India's growth slowed more during COVID than it did in 2008. \n\nEssentially both MMS and Modi faced a crisis, one did ok in managing while Gobiji shat all over his.",
        "Umm... yes they changed the calculations not just to show increased GDP growth in the BJP years... they retroactively changed it to reduce in prior (UPA) years!! \n\nBasically if you believe any data coming out of this regime, you're not fit to operate any sort of business or even a clerical job. Every major investment fund hires their own economists to adjust the govt data to reality just so they can make decisions with some sort of reliable numbers.",
        "I didn't say the data is wrong, I said you have to adjust it with inflation...kinda like how real GDP is 3.3 trillion yet the govt data puts it closer to 4 trillion. I am not going by the regime either, I'm just going by IMF, World Bank, S&P and such sources.",
        "I think under NDA, we're operating on a startup growth trajectory, not so much about benefits today but rather about benefits in the future. But a large chunk of that is driven by industry bodies, not the government per say, so they get to pick and choose the ones they like.\n\nUPI was conceived and created during UPA2 by RBI, but it was the Modi Government that benefitted from its success due to its launch in 2016\n\nSome things I see as long term benefits though\n1. ABHA health record digitisation, combined with primary care license for healthcare professionals (non doctors) , controversial yes, but at India scale and cost of MBBS , India will never be able to have sufficient doctors , I see this as a good thing!\n\n2. Direct Benefits transfer & GEM, this puts a lot of govt procuring and tests a way for govt to pay citizens for goods and services as well in a scalable way in the future. Currently only used for freebies, but the potential is huge!\n\n3. ONDC & India Stack , see ONDC is just a pre-created platform, you can then go ahead and sell anything you want on it, financial services, commerce, education, farm produce whatever, without centralized control, the network is anti-monopoly by design, at scale I see benefits\n\nThere's a few more things as well around defence, infrastructure etc I can mention but that will be too long. We're in the CAPEX period, there will be gains in the future (startup model)\n\nBut I'll also say some major misses that these guys are making\n\n1. Locking up the agri-sector which employs half the population but is heavily regulated, leading to lower farmer incomes and large dependency on Govt.\n\n2. Not increasing the education and R&D budget, some right wing folks would say, in total it's increased but not in terms of %of GDP, well the fact of the matter is , IT NEEDS to increase as % of GDP, atleast to around 5% if we need to catch up\n\n3. Policy unpredictability, like they did with the gaming sector, everyone knew it was whitewashed gambling from the start. But the govt decided to play along for so long and then abruptly shut it down almost like an ultimatum with the stupid tax rules\n\n4. The GST implementation was great in theory, one tax for everything and then they would back calculate share of State and Centre, instead we have CGST, IGST & SGST and everytime there's something that doesn't fit their criteria they slap on the highest slab without thought.\n\n5. Reduce the income required for tax brackets, ffs a tax-paying base of 2% is one of the worst in the world. The most productive citizens are squeezed like crazy and thus you see the massive numbers of talented educated people leaving. Because survival of the unfittest seems to be the rule.\n\nOverall, since it's 5.8% it's not great but quite passable. My bigger problem with the BJP is around their social policies which is a CAPEX towards full blown civil war.",
        "I think people tend to underestimate how hard \"federalism\" - the core building block of our country is being tarnished by Modi and BJP.  Empower and incentivise states to develop on their own instead of trying to control them.\n\nIndia is diverse. There's not a single country that's as heterogeneous as India whereas this regime is all about \" One country One X \" schemes.  This one size fits all solution will spell doom to our development. There's also the problem of lack of development convergence. I highly implore people to read \" South vs North. India's great divide\" by Nilakantan RS to realise how dire this situation poses to \"India\" itself.",

        "IMF and world bank can't officially contradict the regime provided data. They have to accept whatever data the govt of the country provides...  Now, internally of course they have their own estimates and corrections. But they have to operate in a diplomatic manner in their public pronouncements.\n\nAnd  despite all the sleight of hand with data... The UPA period is \\*still\\* showing faster growth. \n\nAnd oh, \"adjust for inflation\" etc., that's the job of the teams of economists/statisticians etc. who put together the data in the first place.  Once the data has been published after all the calculations, it's not supposed to be readjusted by every tom dick and modi again for campaign purposes.",

        "you can't simply keep it out otherwise it won't make much sense. \n\nIf Covid was a shutdown and there was economic contraction the 9% growth that you see post covid also is against that lower base. \n\nyou need to then compare precovid and pre GFC growth rate which again is higher for UPA",
        "the GDP growth rate is inflation adjusted as the prices are based on a particular year called base year.  Any change in price is not accounted afaik",
        "Yeah I figured that. India has to focus on infra, I see the difficulties we face from NL when doing anything over there, it has gotten better but not enough. But the infrastructure was worse during UPA. Neither is better than the other in a lot of aspects but whichever party comes into power its high time to focus on SMBEs and talent pool. Half of students have fake certifications and degree mills, unless that kind of culture changes the nation will lose the window for growth. India should also focus on urbanization which is why infra is important, jobs won't come to folks sitting at home in villages, they have to immigrate to cities, for that tier 2 and tier 3 cities are important. Rural unemployment is the major factor of high youth unemployment in india, this will help alleviate it. NDA imo at least is attempting, regardless of the implementation...UPA wasn't even interested in these things in its 2nd term. I would prefer a liberal UPA government if they had an actual plan. India loses a big portion of its GDP right now due to riots, social issues and discrimination based activities.",

        "OP you should consider \"GDP to debt ratio\" that will give a better insight of the current growth, it's the elephant in the room which the current government doesn't want the public to be aware of.",
        "Two things, one the policies of the govt usually does not show impact immediately so basically first 2-3 years growth is due to the prev govt.  Two the growth should be compared to overall world wise economic growth as countries are interdependent.",

        "Why? They‚Äôre good at acting and making money through that. That‚Äôs it. What meaningful thing can they say about hike in fuel prices?",
        "During UPA govt you also had a much smaller base and it is easier to grow and add value more on a smaller base than a bigger base.\n\nRegarding Modi govt and its victory in 2014 upa 2 was bad like really bad the growth rate had halved from 2010, in minds of the people cwg had brought international shame and after that scandal after scandal. At time of upa from start of 2000 onwards india service sector started to boom. People at fresher levels were earning 30-40k which was unheard at that time. You see it in how our economy quadrupled during the span of 10-12 years from 2000 to 2010-11. \n\nModi govt has done some things like simplifying the indirect tax structure by introducing GST, simplified the direct tax filling process and has rapidly taken steps to ensure that many compliances by corporates and individuals can be obtained online in order to reduce corruption. Modi govt is laying a base for india to be a manufacturing hub. \n\nThe big blunder from modi on the economic front was demonetisation otherwise most of his policies on the economic front have been good.

        "I agree with all your points except the 1st one , they tried de regulating the agri sector but the farmers wanted none of it . Not blaming the farmers the govt should have not forced the bill through instead educated the farmers about its benefits.",
        "No hence they were voted for. But they do not have any plan now. Farmers incomes are flat because agricultural reforms haven't taken place since last 20 years. India needs a green revolution 2.0 for that. Whatever they might serve it is reflected well among the public hence they are getting votes. My parents still live in India, the town they were born in barely had electricity for more than 6 hours and the roads and connectivity was extremely bad, poverty was rampant, outdoor defecation and hygiene was trash...these things improved quite a lot. So much so that their land value went up since everyone from nearby villages started moving in as well. The Congress MLA who was there never did anything, had a huge bungalow and children studying abroad...as soon as BJD won in that part of state and BJP won in the center it took 3 years and almost all of those problems were solved by 2018, electric and water contracts were privatised so that everyone now gets access to it without waiting for govt to do anything. People actually have jobs especially tribals who now work at mines and other industries...congress on the other hand was blocking any industry to take hold over there so you tell me who should they vote for? The party who actually was in power when things got better or congress who did nothing even though they had a direct representative?",
        "Education is one way, they could have also delayed implementation so that both MSP and market price system coexist for a year or so. This would have given farmers who are willing to see the benefit of market linked pricing especially after the Ukraine war induced wheat shortage. Leading to other farmers, slowly gradually taking interest. \n\nInstead they tried to shove it down forcefully as if farmers don't understand anything, we command you obey manner. They got away with quite a bit of such implementation for other policies this one backfired. In the end a miss is a miss, leaving the politics out of it",
        "GDP growth relies on policies that were implemented atleast 5 years ago. NDA has given a lot of effort in removing a lot of red tape, massive boost in infrastructure and finally a focus in manufacturing. The \"high gdp\" growth rates during UPA times faced the same criticism as today - jobless growth. Plus, 2008 effects were not that much on India, as compared to COVID. The next few years india will grow at solid rates, most fundamentals are strong. there are systemic problems like unemployment, but as someone from (former) lower middle class, it's not just govt's fault, but also peoples fault in getting random degrees from degree mills and expecting a cushy office job. a lot of good paying technician jobs are vacant which so called unemployed people refuse to go to.",

The second biggest impact was introducing the mid-day meal scheme in India. The genius of that stroke was that it brought kids to school and fed them nutritious food!

Second, as far as ration is concerned, there are more reforms needed in connection to how food is stored, how ration cards are distributed and distributed. Ensuring food security is a good thing especially during the Covid. However, giving somebody an opportunity to work and gain dignity of labour is completely a different thing and we have seen the benefit of it.\n\nThat being said, we should spend much time in using MNREGA in planning things out. For instance, digging a well is good for the neighborhood and environment etc. I accept your point that MNREGA projects needs to be designed in a way that we can create assets that can be beneficial for the community.",
        "\nEven with MNREGa, work like that won't be available after 2-3 years. UPA was not able to generate employment and that was the reason they did that.\n\nBJP has direct benefit transfer so there are less loopholes so it is actually much better. Those people can actually now learn some skill in that time which may be useful. With MNREGA they won't develop any skill and eventually will do unproductive work.\n\nAnyway let's agree o disagree. My point of view comes from my dad who said that government was actually wasting labours and engieers time in a work which which was a waste. Would be better to give them money to join some vocational training course.",

Tradesmanship, craftsmanship, industrial education or technical education should be taught. However, the GoI, does not even spend 5 per cent on education and training.\n\nThere is a certain truth in what you are saying that UPA years created a lot of jobless growth. There were growth in employment opportunities, but these were largely located to the metro cities etc. What MNREGA did was gave an opportunity for the rural India to make a living. And, I take your point that we should have pipeline about MNREGA. Perhaps, integrate MNREGA with Rural Planning, Road Maintenance, or creating assets at the local level. But, that planning has perhaps not been the best.\n\nLastly, Direct benefit transfer is not BJP's idea but UPA and Nandan Nilkeni's brainchild. What BJP did ushered an era of financial inclusion by opening up free bank accounts to large masses. That was a genuine hard-hitting reform done by BJP. But, we still have a long way to go!\n\nCheers",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Economic Growth under Modi over 10 years has been slower than UPA",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I have been told that India has become a global economic powerhouse under Modi and Modinomics have failed those from Harvard and Cambridge. With Make in India and focus on Ease of doing Business and lower corruption India has entered a golden era. (Ram Rajya) But when we look at the figures, GDP growth has been slower under Modi's 10 years as PM. India has grown at 5.8% between 2014 and 23 while it grew at 6.8% during the UPA 1 and 2 at the end of which UPA was voted out because of inflation and India against corruption movement. We can't ignore thag Modi had to face Covid but UPA had to deal with the 2008 Crisis as well. During BJP's rule, Unemployment has gone up. Na khaunga, Na khaane dunga proved to be an empty promise with BJP leaders caught in several corruption scams. But I don't see any hope. Because this is \"Naya Bharat\" It's not afraid to be proud of its achievements which may or may not be materially consequential. &#x200B; Source: [https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-hindutva-rate-of-gdp-growth-9067341/](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-hindutva-rate-of-gdp-growth-9067341/) &#x200B; &#x200B;",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "&#x200B; Main issue for me is bureaucratic hurdles didn't get simpler, its prohibiting SMBEs so much as a result hurting the economy, social issues are leading to around 4% loss in GDP too. Startups are having so much trouble in scaling up as well due to overregulation. There hasn't been much investment in education while India has a large young population. India was overregulated during UPA, under Modi its weirdly underregulated and overregulated at the same time which is prohibiting higher growth rate. Please leave out the covid years and then talk. Bro used Indianexpress as a sourceüíÄ I preferred Rajdhani express over Indian express thanks Also the data presented by this govt is not at all reliable. They care only about optics and marketing and will do everything in their power to suppress bad news. Recently we learned that Unicef made a report about how open defecation has increased recently but Indian govt did everything in its power to make sure it's not published BJP govt is using the BRICS Goldman Sachs report to say market is reaching $5T etc.... &#x200B; The FI funds injunction is from blackrock, vanguard directly now but previously from mauritus. The reports from the govt is all skewed to their liking and benefit Not swarajya enough for you? Any growth is great - the rest of the world is economically falling apart so if India can have ‚Äúsome‚Äù growth this is great. 1. Yes india has experienced growth even after pandemic and crossed uk even 2. Seriously Indian express is the source 3. Every for and against argument in GDP growth can be manipulated using diffrent base year Hey, I didn't quite understand the Hindutva vs. Hindu vs. Secular categorization. Could you explain it ? How much did you have invested in the market at the time? It‚Äôs easy to just mouth-off when you‚Äôre clueless! Counting Covid-19 pandemic and global recession with war, that‚Äôs still good. If you exclude both the COVID and 2008 both of them have an average of 7.112 and you can't just compare COVID with 2008 as COVID was almost a complete economic shutdown If you exclude both the COVID and 2008 both of them have an average of 7.112 and you can't just compare COVID with 2008 as COVID was almost a complete economic shutdown &#x200B; This. They actually revised data and methods to show higher GDP growth since 2014. But not just that. They went back and retroactively reduced growth rates from previous govt!!! Pretty sure the global economy was hit harder by 2008 crash than COVID. And India's growth slowed more during COVID than it did in 2008. Essentially both MMS and Modi faced a crisis, one did ok in managing while Gobiji shat all over his. Umm... yes they changed the calculations not just to show increased GDP growth in the BJP years... they retroactively changed it to reduce in prior (UPA) years!! Basically if you believe any data coming out of this regime, you're not fit to operate any sort of business or even a clerical job. Every major investment fund hires their own economists to adjust the govt data to reality just so they can make decisions with some sort of reliable numbers. I didn't say the data is wrong, I said you have to adjust it with inflation...kinda like how real GDP is 3.3 trillion yet the govt data puts it closer to 4 trillion. I am not going by the regime either, I'm just going by IMF, World Bank, S&P and such sources. I think under NDA, we're operating on a startup growth trajectory, not so much about benefits today but rather about benefits in the future. But a large chunk of that is driven by industry bodies, not the government per say, so they get to pick and choose the ones they like. UPI was conceived and created during UPA2 by RBI, but it was the Modi Government that benefitted from its success due to its launch in 2016 Some things I see as long term benefits though 1. ABHA health record digitisation, combined with primary care license for healthcare professionals (non doctors) , controversial yes, but at India scale and cost of MBBS , India will never be able to have sufficient doctors , I see this as a good thing! 2. Direct Benefits transfer & GEM, this puts a lot of govt procuring and tests a way for govt to pay citizens for goods and services as well in a scalable way in the future. Currently only used for freebies, but the potential is huge! 3. ONDC & India Stack , see ONDC is just a pre-created platform, you can then go ahead and sell anything you want on it, financial services, commerce, education, farm produce whatever, without centralized control, the network is anti-monopoly by design, at scale I see benefits There's a few more things as well around defence, infrastructure etc I can mention but that will be too long. We're in the CAPEX period, there will be gains in the future (startup model) But I'll also say some major misses that these guys are making 1. Locking up the agri-sector which employs half the population but is heavily regulated, leading to lower farmer incomes and large dependency on Govt. 2. Not increasing the education and R&D budget, some right wing folks would say, in total it's increased but not in terms of %of GDP, well the fact of the matter is , IT NEEDS to increase as % of GDP, atleast to around 5% if we need to catch up 3. Policy unpredictability, like they did with the gaming sector, everyone knew it was whitewashed gambling from the start. But the govt decided to play along for so long and then abruptly shut it down almost like an ultimatum with the stupid tax rules 4. The GST implementation was great in theory, one tax for everything and then they would back calculate share of State and Centre, instead we have CGST, IGST & SGST and everytime there's something that doesn't fit their criteria they slap on the highest slab without thought. 5. Reduce the income required for tax brackets, ffs a tax-paying base of 2% is one of the worst in the world. The most productive citizens are squeezed like crazy and thus you see the massive numbers of talented educated people leaving. Because survival of the unfittest seems to be the rule. Overall, since it's 5.8% it's not great but quite passable. My bigger problem with the BJP is around their social policies which is a CAPEX towards full blown civil war. I think people tend to underestimate how hard \"federalism\" - the core building block of our country is being tarnished by Modi and BJP. Empower and incentivise states to develop on their own instead of trying to control them. India is diverse. There's not a single country that's as heterogeneous as India whereas this regime is all about \" One country One X \" schemes. This one size fits all solution will spell doom to our development. There's also the problem of lack of development convergence. I highly implore people to read \" South vs North. India's great divide\" by Nilakantan RS to realise how dire this situation poses to \"India\" itself. I will not deny Cauliflower-san shat his pants. Eee to sala hona hi tha IMF and world bank can't officially contradict the regime provided data. They have to accept whatever data the govt of the country provides... Now, internally of course they have their own estimates and corrections. But they have to operate in a diplomatic manner in their public pronouncements. And despite all the sleight of hand with data... The UPA period is \\*still\\* showing faster growth. And oh, \"adjust for inflation\" etc., that's the job of the teams of economists/statisticians etc. who put together the data in the first place. Once the data has been published after all the calculations, it's not supposed to be readjusted by every tom dick and modi again for campaign purposes. Again when did I say anything different to you? What is the purpose of your comment even? Here we observe the rare creature known as a 'balanced post' in its natural environment. >yet the govt data puts it closer to 4 trillion source? EDIT: You are wrong [https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD) yeah, my bad. Context is missing from the image. You can look at the article cited as the source in the post. but the GDP data is from CMIE the GDP data is from CMIE and not Indian Express you can't simply keep it out otherwise it won't make much sense. If Covid was a shutdown and there was economic contraction the 9% growth that you see post covid also is against that lower base. you need to then compare precovid and pre GFC growth rate which again is higher for UPA the GDP growth rate is inflation adjusted as the prices are based on a particular year called base year. Any change in price is not accounted afaik Yeah I figured that. India has to focus on infra, I see the difficulties we face from NL when doing anything over there, it has gotten better but not enough. But the infrastructure was worse during UPA. Neither is better than the other in a lot of aspects but whichever party comes into power its high time to focus on SMBEs and talent pool. Half of students have fake certifications and degree mills, unless that kind of culture changes the nation will lose the window for growth. India should also focus on urbanization which is why infra is important, jobs won't come to folks sitting at home in villages, they have to immigrate to cities, for that tier 2 and tier 3 cities are important. Rural unemployment is the major factor of high youth unemployment in india, this will help alleviate it. NDA imo at least is attempting, regardless of the implementation...UPA wasn't even interested in these things in its 2nd term. I would prefer a liberal UPA government if they had an actual plan. India loses a big portion of its GDP right now due to riots, social issues and discrimination based activities. Which paper do you prefer then? Why is Indian express not a good source lol wtf is going on OP you should consider \"GDP to debt ratio\" that will give a better insight of the current growth, it's the elephant in the room which the current government doesn't want the public to be aware of. Two things, one the policies of the govt usually does not show impact immediately so basically first 2-3 years growth is due to the prev govt. Two the growth should be compared to overall world wise economic growth as countries are interdependent. Name some of the large economies without resource wealth like Saudi oil which do not have debt also debt is good as long as it does not cause a economic crisis Economic growth is not a switch that can be turned on or off in an instant recovery takes time like it did around the world after the global financial meltdown in 2008 Why? They‚Äôre good at acting and making money through that. That‚Äôs it. What meaningful thing can they say about hike in fuel prices? During UPA govt you also had a much smaller base and it is easier to grow and add value more on a smaller base than a bigger base. Regarding Modi govt and its victory in 2014 upa 2 was bad like really bad the growth rate had halved from 2010, in minds of the people cwg had brought international shame and after that scandal after scandal. At time of upa from start of 2000 onwards india service sector started to boom. People at fresher levels were earning 30-40k which was unheard at that time. You see it in how our economy quadrupled during the span of 10-12 years from 2000 to 2010-11. Modi govt has done some things like simplifying the indirect tax structure by introducing GST, simplified the direct tax filling process and has rapidly taken steps to ensure that many compliances by corporates and individuals can be obtained online in order to reduce corruption. Modi govt is laying a base for india to be a manufacturing hub. The big blunder from modi on the economic front was demonetisation otherwise most of his policies on the economic front have been good. Even his marketing campaigns are necessary Jo dikhta hai woh bikta hai. Same meaningful things th get said about internal matters. >sanctions on some Indian products by US weren't present during UPA rule There were plenty of sanctions on Indian businesses by us thanks to the drunkard's nuclear tests that were repealed only late in upa2. >headwinds created due to covid the economic effects were immense, World economy crumbled during us housing crisis and its aftermath. Indian economy thrived. Nuclear tests were necessary. And it was planned and being done way before NDA came around. And th here were sanctions. People will still vote for the same lunatics in the coming elections. Cause attacking based on religion trumps any sort of development according to BJP and its supporters. What a clusterfuck During NDA not UPA. Even common citizens won't. They'll still vote for them in the coming elections because doubling down on showing support for BJP despite knowing they're absolute shite, will fare better for their small pp ego than actually protest. lol lol Well, this is definitely gonna change the average voter's mind. Let's bring INDIA alliance back and skyrocket our GDP to 10% growth y-o-y. Agriculture reforms will be last nail in coffin, just like in the U.S. The difference is UPA numbers were only visible on paper and they topped it up with large scale corruption and terrible inflation. During the last two NDA terms the changes are visible on the ground so how much ever number crunching gymnastics you do, no sane person would buy your argument that UPA was better in any way. From my experience UPA was the most corrupt government in the history of independent India and a culmination of all the corrupt practices congress built over several decades. It's pointing out the hypocrisy of actors who were mocking congress for fuel prices pre 2014. Nothing is being covered on the ground. All media orgs are acting as govt's mouthpieces. Do you expect the average Indian to research 2-3 hours everyday to get to real news or just sit for 15 min in front of TV while having snacks and blissfully ignore all the issues? This govt has been equally if not more corrupt than UPA. At least MMS dared to have ITR as a law which proved to be a doom for his own govt. This regime has legitimised corruption and people suddenly behave as if its Ram Rajya. But even then BJP will win 2024 lok sabha elections on their own That's the reality and that is the sign of failed Opposition especially Congress. Congress failed to present itself as an alternative Ground par log pareshaan hai par congress ko alternative nhi mante They need a PM face and that is not Rahul Gandhi can be Uddhav Thackeray, Nitish Kumar, Ashok Gehlot etc. agree Nothing is visible on ground Media ka banaya hua hahua hai but 2024 will be won by BJP This is not unique to India. Growth all over the world has slowed down after the Great Recession. Standards of Living have taken a hit in most developed countries. Even China hasn't been able to match its pre-GFC growth rate. Covid ruined another couple of years. Correlation ‚â† Causation. UPA's bad decisions were also some of the reasons for the slowdowns we saw after 2014, like the Bank NPA crisis and the ruinous Oil Bonds. Bollywood stars wouldn't even know what the gas prices are. They shed crocodile tears. The huge infrastructure push will yield dividend in the long run just like it did in China and US You should be asking the source for the 3.3T figure. CMIE's data isn't even consistent with its own previous data. No wonder Indian Express is now considered a joke now. Stop talking about stupid stuff like economics, let's discuss which minority/mosque to target next. /s As the base gets bigger it gets harder to achieve 9%> I'm not saying upa or nda. Everyone is benefiting from 1991 liberalisation - which was brought about by Congress incompetence. This Congress is different, they are somewhat more market friendly. So is the BJP. Issue with Congress now, is that for their people pleasing, they will bring OPS, they will bring reservation in private sector, will increase reservation in everything, and will run a huge fiscal deficit and will destroy the economy. Lie Why don‚Äôt you include inflation numbers and global growth numbers. In a vacuum looking at gdp growth is just empty stats. Need context with it. This is why I adore reddit...an honest analysis of economy. lol. all of this is based on \"your experience\" which can wasily be warped by govt. controlling the media and not facts. so the GDP growth rates were achieved without a plan ? the thing is BJP does not have a plan. all the poll promises made about black money, millions jobs, doubling farmers' icnomes have all fallen flat and served as just election gimmicks. I agree with all your points except the 1st one , they tried de regulating the agri sector but the farmers wanted none of it . Not blaming the farmers the govt should have not forced the bill through instead educated the farmers about its benefits. No hence they were voted for. But they do not have any plan now. Farmers incomes are flat because agricultural reforms haven't taken place since last 20 years. India needs a green revolution 2.0 for that. Whatever they might serve it is reflected well among the public hence they are getting votes. My parents still live in India, the town they were born in barely had electricity for more than 6 hours and the roads and connectivity was extremely bad, poverty was rampant, outdoor defecation and hygiene was trash...these things improved quite a lot. So much so that their land value went up since everyone from nearby villages started moving in as well. The Congress MLA who was there never did anything, had a huge bungalow and children studying abroad...as soon as BJD won in that part of state and BJP won in the center it took 3 years and almost all of those problems were solved by 2018, electric and water contracts were privatised so that everyone now gets access to it without waiting for govt to do anything. People actually have jobs especially tribals who now work at mines and other industries...congress on the other hand was blocking any industry to take hold over there so you tell me who should they vote for? The party who actually was in power when things got better or congress who did nothing even though they had a direct representative? Education is one way, they could have also delayed implementation so that both MSP and market price system coexist for a year or so. This would have given farmers who are willing to see the benefit of market linked pricing especially after the Ukraine war induced wheat shortage. Leading to other farmers, slowly gradually taking interest. Instead they tried to shove it down forcefully as if farmers don't understand anything, we command you obey manner. They got away with quite a bit of such implementation for other policies this one backfired. In the end a miss is a miss, leaving the politics out of it GDP growth relies on policies that were implemented atleast 5 years ago. NDA has given a lot of effort in removing a lot of red tape, massive boost in infrastructure and finally a focus in manufacturing. The \"high gdp\" growth rates during UPA times faced the same criticism as today - jobless growth. Plus, 2008 effects were not that much on India, as compared to COVID. The next few years india will grow at solid rates, most fundamentals are strong. there are systemic problems like unemployment, but as someone from (former) lower middle class, it's not just govt's fault, but also peoples fault in getting random degrees from degree mills and expecting a cushy office job. a lot of good paying technician jobs are vacant which so called unemployed people refuse to go to. i was about to write a similar post but you beat me to it! A lot of people here dont seem to realise that the returns and data we see today is due to policies and things laid out atleast 5+ years ago. a lot of money right now is being poured into infra, lots of companies betting on manufacturing, which is expected to give decent growth in the upcoming years. The startup ecosystem was allowed to grow only because they started removing a lot of the redtape around it. &#x200B; Everyone knows IT is not going to sustain forever, they are focusing more on manufacturing now. first time hearing about the unicef case, can you cite a source on that? very sad What to ban next? üòé What to rename next? Did you factor in that a couple of years of growth was lost due to covid. What people experiences in daily life is not through ‚Äòmedia‚Äô. during 2008 india was not as connected with the world and everything didnt completely stop whereas covid was a totally different ballgame those two are not even comparable during 2008 india was not as connected with the world and everything didnt completely stop whereas covid was a completely different ballgame both are not even comparable also stop deleting my comments. lol and these people cry about free speech the loudest The government will avoid touching agriculture sector for a few years They've dug their own grave Yeh Agra mei maine suna hai kuch hai bada sa safed rang ka. Or maybe they don't even use LPG, just those fancy expensive looking electric-magnetic flat cooktops. When they declared that we are 5th largest economy in the world tabhi mujhe laga ki kuch to gadbad hogi that can't be true because of modi Ha bro how can any newspaper criticize gobhiji. Gobhiji had made india vishwaguru vrooo. /s it's very naive if you think opinions can't be shaped using media. propaganda exists for a reason and have worked several times throughout the history and continues to do so. Thanks! It‚Äôs very naive of you to assume people can‚Äôt see through propaganda if they don‚Äôt see relatable outcomes & changes in their real life. If propaganda alone could do the trick, we‚Äôd still be under the rule of the parivar. Whole world is slowing down + we have covid 19 too and still we are the fastest growing major economy. I don't see the problem. Maybe we could grow faster but this is not bad in any way tbf Most probably they won't cook. A middle class family in India has a cook, cleaner etc. with so much money, they can own a mini restaurant Well I remember it was partly the people's fault in the rural areas. They just didn't want to use the toilets. I don't know what else caused this to happen but this point caught my eye. They only know cooked food and fruits. Probably dont know that LPG is an English Acronym widely used at India.üòÇ Where do we stand on Corruption as of 2023 ? Compared to UPA 1 & 2 Bcz UPA growth was effect of pv rao and ABVs reforms while starting of modi yrs was effect of UPAs disastrous economic policies 2nd term modi was due to pandemic slowdown lol. > fruits I won't be surprised if some Bollywood star eats strawberries that grow in Swiss. Someone told me Virat Kohli drinks only Evian water imported from France. Not sure how true that is. Worse! >also stop deleting my comments. lol and these people cry about free speech the loudest Start taking the schizo meds lol Few yrs lost to covid and GDP formula changes might've rendered this comparison not worth it bruv u musn't be handling businesses to know that corruption has scaled up >Everyone knows IT is not going to sustain forever, they are focusing more on manufacturing now. Manufacturing employment in India has plummeted during the last few years, falling by as much as 50%. The country is de-industrializing at a rapid rate. When Modi says he's focusing on manufacturing, that's just a cover for him to shovel public money to Adani and his other crooked friends. The actual results say otherwise. >2008 crisis, unlike the 1930s, wasnt hitting us that hard. That's because MMS actually managed the crisis intelligently, whereas Modi completely butchered the response to Covid. The 2008 crisis hurt the global economy more than Covid did. And have you protested? Bjp growth was very slow in 2 years 2019 and 2020. 2019 was because of demonetization and 2020 covid. Inflation has gone down and isn't unemployment still low? I meant, compared to UPA‚Äôs time, how much has it increased ? This article is shit, we can see the results we crossed the UK and are now the bigger economy, the community is a propaganda run. By left wing assholes does it even matter , do people(majority) even care?, they are forming gov again.... Can we stop posting 2020 data and stating that it is a trend lmao? By the same logic India used to have 8% growth in the past but has -9% growth now. sry I was sleepy, I meant the bribes have become really streamlined, and it's a given now, especially in bigger projects The money is supposed to be channeled via CA's it's not like the old times now where it usually was two thugs with a briefcase, now its a potbellied guy with a laptop usually. Money usually does a few rounds btw shell companies and (in large amts) even offshore accounts. Dunno how they handle it internally tho not affiliated with any parties Biryani? I think economic growth is one part of the puzzle. The other hard hitting reforms of UPA was MNREGA and Mid-day Meal scheme. MNREGA allowed India growth story to be little dispersed to far rung villages of India. This might have had a significant impact on millions of poor people coming out of poverty. The second biggest impact was introducing the mid-day meal scheme in India. The genius of that stroke was that it brought kids to school and fed them nutritious food! Irrespective of the party in power, India need multiple hard hitting reforms in education and rural India. Sadly for me, I have not seen any hard-hitting reforms from the present Modi govt, yet! I dont understand your comment. You're just stating stats in a vaccum.way to simplistic. These are real GDP growth rates not nominal which means GDP deflator (inflation adjusted) is already taken care of. Secondly, inflation comparison with oil prices added are as below - Year|Infln|Oil Prices :--|:--|:-- 2004|3.77|41.51 2005|4.25|56.64 2006|5.8|66.05 2007|6.37|72.34 2008|8.35|99.67 2009|10.8|61.95 2010|11.99|79.48 2011|8.91|94.88 2012|9.48|94.05 2013|10|97.98 2014|6.67|93.17 2015|4.91|48.66 2016|4.95|43.29 2017|3.33|50.8 2018|3.94|65.23 2019|3.73|56.99 2020|6.62|39.68 2021|5.13|68.17 2022|6.7|94.53 Label|Inflation|Average Oil Price :--|:--|:-- Avg UPA 1 | 5.7% | 67 USD Avg UPA 2 | 9.65% | 87 USD Avg Modi | 4.92%| 58 USD This shows that inflation in UPA 1 was absolutely under control. UPA 2 had record high oil prices which touched 140 USD and consequently got the blow of high inflation. Inflation in Modi is lesser because they inherited record low oil prices.

I did. I also voted. Now the BJP is out of Karnataka. Doing what little I can. Hell nawww man thats just sad What is capex? its almost 2024. you are citing 2020 data here... have you been asleep for the past 4 years? Check [Manufacturing PMI](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/manufacturing-pmi]). It is showing strong growth with no signs of stopping. Hell literally just open any business newspaper and youll find ton of companies, etc. setting up factories in India and going all in in Manufacturing. This includes Tata, Wipro, hell even ambani. Last quarter's strong growth was powered mainly by manufacturing alongside with other things. Capital expenses, usually the first investment that is spent in building something before you start getting returns out of it. Imagine a lemonade stand. Capex: the one time money you need to buy the stand, utensils etc. to start selling Opex: the money you will spend regularly buying lemons, water & sugar to keep selling Opex is called operating expenses Really? China used to have a faster growth rate than India. Currently, they have a lower growth rate than we do. Clearly, the masters of growth have slowed down more than us in an age of slowdowns. And speaking of misinformation, why do you choose Delta? If you take a ratio of the growth rates of India over the World, they end up being much closer. That's impressive, considering Covid hit India way harder than the GFC. >Really? China used to have a faster growth rate than India. Currently, they have a lower growth rate than we do. Clearly, the masters of growth have slowed down more than us in an age of slowdowns. China average growth is higher than us during Modi period. Their average is 6.07% while our average growth is 5.67%. Their economy is 5 times our size and despite that they grew faster These are real GDP growth rates not nominal which means GDP deflator (inflation adjusted) is already taken care of.

UPA 2 had record high oil prices which touched 140 USD and consequently got the blow of high inflation. Inflation in Modi is lesser because they inherited record low oil prices. UPA numbers weren‚Äôt only visible on paper. We saw massive growth in employment in the formal sector during the UPA years, especially for young people. One the other hand, under the NDA, youth unemployment is soaring . In 2014, UPI faced a test for its past 10 years of performance. In 2024, BJP will face the same. Let's see who the Janta thinks is better. That will clear it out. TLDR : modi growth shit vote anyone else > BJP leaders caught in several corruption scams. Where are they getting caught with BJP busy sending ED raids to opposition ministers they want to avenge or mess with. Only one war , then all the figures and hype that is created will show up in their real faces Lol if Janta was educated enough to understand economics then India would have been in a different place. Even you who is educated and a Redditor (shich means top 5% of the population) was spreading misinformation till last comment. There is a rapist Brij Bhushan Singh who the Modi govt refused to take action on. Had the INC had a sitting minister who was accused of molestation by 16 wrestlers, the entire country would have come together for protests. First 2-3 years of UPA are effect of previous NDA government, Effect of congress was seen from after that, Final effect of congress was seen in last few years of UPA government where India was in fragile 5. No, it didn't affect India much. only around 15% of India's GDp was connected to the world economy. There is an article by Shashi Tharoor on this. IF MNREGA is hard hitting reform where people dig and fill up the same hole again and again then free ration distribution is also an hard reform. There are differences. First of all, Right to Food was passed under UPA not Modi govt. Second, as far as ration is concerned, there are more reforms needed in connection to how food is stored, how ration cards are distributed and distributed. Ensuring food security is a good thing especially during the Covid. However, giving somebody an opportunity to work and gain dignity of labour is completely a different thing and we have seen the benefit of it. That being said, we should spend much time in using MNREGA in planning things out. For instance, digging a well is good for the neighborhood and environment etc. I accept your point that MNREGA projects needs to be designed in a way that we can create assets that can be beneficial for the community. Even with MNREGa, work like that won't be available after 2-3 years. UPA was not able to generate employment and that was the reason they did that. BJP has direct benefit transfer so there are less loopholes so it is actually much better. Those people can actually now learn some skill in that time which may be useful. With MNREGA they won't develop any skill and eventually will do unproductive work. Anyway let's agree o disagree. My point of view comes from my dad who said that government was actually wasting labours and engieers time in a work which which was a waste. Would be better to give them money to join some vocational training course. the irony.... You are right about vocational training courses. India does have that system, but it's being neglected majorly. Tradesmanship, craftsmanship, industrial education or technical education should be taught. However, the GoI, does not even spend 5 per cent on education and training. There is a certain truth in what you are saying that UPA years created a lot of jobless growth. There were growth in employment opportunities, but these were largely located to the metro cities etc. What MNREGA did was gave an opportunity for the rural India to make a living. And, I take your point that we should have pipeline about MNREGA. Perhaps, integrate MNREGA with Rural Planning, Road Maintenance, or creating assets at the local level. But, that planning has perhaps not been the best. Lastly, Direct benefit transfer is not BJP's idea but UPA and Nandan Nilkeni's brainchild. What BJP did ushered an era of financial inclusion by opening up free bank accounts to large masses. That was a genuine hard-hitting reform done by BJP. But, we still have a long way to go! Cheers By that logic, first couple of years of Modi govt also was because they inherited the policies of UPA? In fact the first 2 years of Modi govt had high growth and then it completely slumped from 2016 onwards. That looks even worse for Modi If I may add : demonetisation . Great in theory ( was considered a bad idea by then RBI governor) ... Turned out to be the biggest sham. It shook the entire market and for what ? Absolutely no gain or seizing of black money... OP following the different threads, there‚Äôs a fundamental problem of people showing whatever data they think will highlight a different argument around NDA good / NDA bad. For a more productive post, you need to start with a specific dataset, and commentary of relevant items/policies of what contributes to that problem. This could be missed opportunities, etc. The issue remains that you‚Äôre not really substantiating your argument beyond a single article. They did try to bring the farm laws, which were opposed mindlessly. Then they repealed it because they are cowards Global recession? Have you seen 2008 -2010 world economy? Is this data include new way of calculating GDP that was introduced few years back? No it was Nehru's policy that impacted modi's performance since in 10 years /s The proposed farm laws only created a new marketplace. I don't think this would classify as a reform other than benefitting some business persons. Moreover, BJP did not create any consensus for the farm law before passing it. That's the real politics where BJP failed! In the food and agriculture sector, we need two massive reforms : i) more business friendly laws for land and labor, ii) invest in and or encourage investment in developing the cold-chain logistics all over India. Demonitization was pretty much the death of growth trajectory. It's the inflection point along with GST that started pulling the numbers lower and killed off the un-organized sector. [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=IN](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=IN) Growth was slowing down even before Covid when the rest of the world was enjoying a relatively good phase fuelled by cheap money.

DBT was started under UPA :) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct\\_Benefit\\_Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Benefit_Transfer) Execution matters. Congress didn't even believe that vegetable sellers would be accepting digital payments. How is DBT and digital payments (UPI) even linked? DBT was for disbursal of subsidies and UPI usage grew only due to demonitization. That was just an example of execution. DBT would require all these people to have accounts, congress wouldn't be able to get such internet penetration, yes you may blame BJP for Adhaar not having right privacy and giving favors to Jio. But they did it. >DBT would require all these people to have accounts, congress wouldn't be able to get such internet penetration, yes you may blame BJP for Adhaar not having right privacy and giving favors to Jio.
