But no FIR was filed as the police claimed he died due to chest pain due to a pre-existing condition, and as his family had neither lodged a complaint nor wanted a post-mortem. \n\nThe family, on the other hand, has alleged that the police “took advantage of their poverty and illiteracy” to hush up the matter. They claimed it was the police who “forced” them to sign a Rs 10 stamp paper stating that Kumar’s “death was due to an existing illness” and that “post-mortem was not required”. ",
