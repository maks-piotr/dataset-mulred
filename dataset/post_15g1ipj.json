    "selftext": " As a growing number of software development companies outsource their software testing work to India, the country is predicted to outperform its rivals in the software testing industry. Industry experts predict that India will hold 70% of the market in the future due to the substantial amount of testing jobs that will be outsourced to India globally.\n\nA key component of guaranteeing the accuracy of application development and upgrades is software testing, which accounts for roughly about 30% of the project’s overall costs.\n\n**Manish Gupta, CEO of TestingXperts** [**said**](https://www.testorigen.com/industry-trends-and-insights-india-is-set-to-become-the-leading-hub-for-software-testing/)**, “With an increase in the number of software development organisations outsourcing their software testing jobs here, India is predicted to control 70% of the market.”**\n\nSoftware testing is estimated to have a market value of $40 billion in 2021 and $70 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of above 6%. According to analysts, prominent corporations in the sector either have their corporate headquarters in India or some of their biggest offshore delivery hubs. Along with Europe, the United States, China, Japan, and South East Asia, India stands out as one of the most significant regions in the global software testing market.\n\n**Manish claims that the year 2022 has seen the continuation of profound technical and digital transformation transformations, necessitating continuous innovation and self-reinvention on the part of enterprises. The development, validation, delivery, and operating processes for software in businesses are impacted by wide and quick technological advancement. Therefore, these firms must continually innovate and reinvent themselves if they want to produce and deliver high-quality software quickly. They must find ways to enhance their technologies and processes to accomplish this, he continued.**\n\nThe accounts from all across the world make it clear that software failure might result in damage that is beyond repair. According to a 2017 Tricentis survey, businesses worldwide have reported losing $1.7 trillion in assets, which has an impact on 3.7 million individuals worldwide. The final product will perform better than anticipated if all testing phases are successfully completed, as there has been sufficient software testing. The testers can identify the flaws at each level and take corrective action to avoid similar problems in the future.",
