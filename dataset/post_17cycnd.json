    "selftext": "I have been searching in AM for some time now. While it is expected to run into a few oddballs with unreasonable requirements, I'm finding that this is slowly becoming more widespread.\n\nThe latest being this girl I talked to recently. The girl liked my profile on jeevansathi and had sent me an invite which I accepted. We exchanged numbers and talked on the phone. The first 2-3 calls went ok as we talked about each other, hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc... basic introduction stuff.\n\nSince we found the basic things compatible, we decided to talk further and that is when things started to go south. In the next call, we were talking about each other's expectations, deal breakers, etc. This is where working after marriage came up. I told her that it would be her choice and I would be supportive.\n\nShe said that she would like to continue working after marriage. I will require support and help from my spouse though, she added.\n\nI agreed again, even though i had said the same thing seconds ago.\n\nThis is when she waved the first red flag. Words like these are easy for boys to say. Your words are meaningless, she said and I was flabbergasted.\n\nWhat else are you expecting me to do on the phone then, I asked.\n\nShe ignored the question. I'm a bit of a feminist, she said. I expect gender equality everywhere.\n\nI'm sure with an understanding partner it is possible, I spluttered. That 'meaningless' comment had thrown me off so I was finding it difficult to be involved in the conversation. We talked about this and that for some more time before I asked, any other expectations?\n\nYes, she said, waving the red flags enthusiastically now. I expect my husband to be financially well off and to be capable of handling the financial responsibilities of home, including our lifestyle. And then she said those fateful words that will forever be etched in my memory, I do not expect to be asked to contribute financially to the marriage in any way. \\[This is exactly the words she used. In that exact order.\\]\n\nAnd. I. Was. Floored. In my head, questions were erupting. You are going to be working too so why is our lifestyle only my responsibility? You want an equal and supportive partner but do not want to be one? Where is the gender equality now? But I only said ok as I was sure that further discussion on this would definitely lead to an argument. I made up some excuse and ended the call.\n\nSome hours later when I had settled a bit, I was thinking about the conversation and thought that maybe I should give her the benefit of doubt. May be she did not mean the words in the manner she said it and may have had trouble putting her thoughts forward in a proper way. Ohh, how wrong i was.\n\nBecause the next day came and in the morning, without any preamble or even a hi, she sent me the link in the chat screenshot below. The Instagram link is a clip from 'The Kapil Sharma Show' of some woman talking about being equal partners. Specifically, that taking care of a house is a hard and full time job, etc...\n\nI think of myself as a rational person but when she sent that link, I saw red. I agree that managing a house is not an easy job, especially if you are a working woman but this girl is just coming into this with a 'woe is me' attitude. I had offered her support but she rejected that saying words are easy for boys to say and are meaningless. And yet at the same time, to \"not expect to contribute financially in any way\"? If she is working and if I'm being an equal partner in the house why couldn't she be an equal partner there? She is not doing me a favor by marrying me. It is both our decision to marry to create a life together, so why isn't a stable life as much her responsibility as mine? And what happens if I'm not able to contribute financially? She has made it clear that I can't rely on her.\n\nIt was clear that the girl had issues but what angered me was her entitlement. The discussion in the screenshots then followed, during which I struggled to stay calm.\n\nBut at the end of it, I realized that she was not looking for a husband or a partner but someone to bankroll her lifestyle, and she was going to complain the whole way with her victim complex. Any issues which occurred would be because of me and would be my responsibility to resolve, and I could not really rely on her for support. I decided to end it.\n\nBut the whole thing had made me sour about the process. I want to say that this was the only person like this I encountered but sadly there are many others just like these (and many past the marriage age). I understand that we all have expectations but they should be reasonable and should be what we are willing to put into the marriage too. No one is doing the other a favor by marrying them but it seems that many people think the opposite and expect to get a lot more out of the marriage than what they are bringing to it.\n\nEnd of Rant.\n\nWhatsapp Chat Screenshots: [https://imgur.com/a/w5tvNqC](https://imgur.com/a/w5tvNqC)",

        "Man to man talk. This will look highly stupid but this is my take and that's how I proceeded with my girl whom Im gonna marry next year.\n\nBro, forget about money and status and look for a girl much below your status quo. Could also be from your local village.\n\nThe girl doesn't need to be beautiful or in model standards , most guys mess up this thing in arranged marriage, that lust just takes over while selecting the girl cuz you wanna stand next to a really good looking female.\n\nBruh, naturally after pregnancy they gonna become fat and loose their looks just like you gonna grow tummy and balding head.\n\nForget about these two constants and marry someone who's not a feminist. It's soo easy finding such girls, I swear.\n\nShe will look after you and your mental peace. These two are enough man, you can earn more money with such a peaceful life rather than this money exchange arrange marriage deals.\n\nI know how absurd this sounds. Don't remind me that people 😂. Honestly my girl has nothing financially or look wise to offer me. But everything else a guy can possibly have.",
        "@OP, the “not contributing financially” is a red flag, I agree. On the other hand, some people pay the partner who stays at home some sort of salary for the care work they do. Talk it out with her, she sounds like she spent a minute too long on the internet in ultra-feminist / anti-men circles.",

        "You are describing my life here since last 1 year. I ignored all the above red flags from my stbxw's family and was **stupid** **stupid** **stupid** enough to get hitched. Now seeking divorce.\n\nAll those demands before marriage multiply by a factor of 100x after marriage. \n\nMy lesson learnt was - if someone is brazen enough to put forth their stupid (abnormal) demands before marriage, think about their thought process of how brazen they will be after you get married. \n\nI am all in for feminism, but against nazi-feminism.\n\nGlad you dodged that bullet buddy and hopefully you will find the right one soon.",
        "I am not defending the girl, but it feels that you are being too emotionally hurt because the reply she was giving didn't fit your criteria as I can understand. I think you need to move on quickly as this was just one debacle, I would suggest you to keep searching and just move on from this. There is not use debating about the past, and keep a fresh mindset about the next one you find and don't let this problem deter you into believing everyone is the same.

        "Why do people try to see a future with someone who doesn't even text at their level.. bhai itne mein hi kat leti mai toh",
        "\nSee, there are two options:\n\n1) Absolute Equality - Both partners work, earn similar amounts/work similar hours, they come home and do 50% of the household chores. Everything is 50-50 here. \n\n2) Partial equality/equity - Both partners are working. The woman usually earns less than her male spouse (since women in AM tend to marry men older & more experienced than them). In this case, the wife feels that her income should be reserved for her personal spending and/or emergency situations like if the husband suddenly loses his job. Otherwise, almost all financial responsibilities will be on the man while almost all household duties will be on the woman. \n\nIn the second setup, there is more equality than in the traditional housewife+earning man arrangement since the wife is not fully financially dependent on you. But it also recognizes that traditionally men were the bread earners while women have only started working since the last 2-3 generations. Some women feel that them working is a big enough contribution since anyway the household work will fall on them + pregnancy + child rearing. 🤷 The world will never be equal no matter how hard we try because of biological differences.\n\nFrom your chats, it seems like the girl has trouble believeing that you will actually support her/contribute to household stuff etc. So she is clarifying her stand beforehand that she won't contribute financially and is preparing herself for other duties - bcuz she feels she will have to contribute a lot more than you, in terms of household & child rearing duties, regardless of what you say right now.",

And in the process obviously there will be time when you come across a concept and it might look right initially but then when you give it a deep thought, you will find flaws in it and similarly you might find yourself stuck with an ofd notion and with some time you will release that it actually made sense. My point being, sometimes it will take some time to wrap your head around a concept, understand it from different POVs, and decide if it works for you. Mistakes happen, when it does accept it, think rationally and make a change. That  is what makes a person incredible. So to all the women out there, embrace change, toss out the bads and never give up on the goods 🥂",

There are multiple modern cases when the husband expects his wife to go to work just after delivery because 1 salary isn't enough.  It happens .\n\n\n Another reason is lack of women in the marriage market. A lot of guys and their families are ok with women doing nothing in the marriage and these are actually from influential families, wives of top beauracrats, bas shaadi kar lo.

Think about it in way a guy a offering easy life and another is offering hard life people are going to choose easy life.\n\nMy cousin sister is pretty she had no job graduated from tier 1 college, but she married a guy who had no demand  and with Indian salary of 70 lakhs with age difference of 1 year and no dowry. And he is good looking.  \n\nHonestly as someone who has a younger brother, take this advice . The guys who are sympathetic to you here will adjust will all t&c when they see pretty women .\nMoreover, these most of demands are set by fathers or approved by fathers of these women because its a competition between fathers to marry their daughters to  rich men.

Only then, when you decide to share your life, can you share it as a team and not as dependents to eachother. For years, I was conditioned as a little girl, into understanding what my role should be in life through society. But it was actually unconditioning and relearning that helped me snap out of it. Then I realised, it's not just the women who are conditioned but also the men in different aspects. For instance, right after college, I didn't get a job immediately and just travelled through the country, funded by my past work of teaching children art. But my guy friends didn't have this privilege, as soon as they graduated, they were expected to get a job and contribute at home by their families.. So I take it easy. I try to look at a person as a human being regardless of their gender. Alot of the people aren't able to snap out of identifying themselves in gender defined roles. Cooking, cleaning, earning money, and being able to protect yourself are basic life skills that every human should know, despite the gender. I also realised that once I was able to do the 4, and find a partner who could also do the 4, our life and love is much more natural, authentic and evolving -together. Sharing responsibilities is a beautiful experience together. To stand with eachother vs the world. So maybe, while you're in this journey of finding a partner, it will help to understand if they can play these 4 roles independently. If they can, and so can you; it will be a want-based relationship and not a need-based one. I hope you find a partner who advocates and lives in true-equality, and not faux.",

You can discuss your solution to it for e.g. we have a joint account where we both put 60% of our income and rest we both get to keep with ourselves or any other arrangements. \nIf she can see past her mistake and take your view in consideration, that's actually a very good sign. Maybe her own stand is not stiff and she just hasn't thought about financial set up deeply and is hence being childish. \n\nCommunicate your view point. At night, you simply said ok and left. Which is good since you need time to think. It was her bad timing to have sent that video, but I feel you kind of lashed onto her. I would suggest you give some space for disagreements and faults during your courtship period. \n\nDisagreements at this stage are good, they also show that both sides are compatible enough to reach an agreement as well. \n\nAlso, please understand in the last 26-28 years she has had experiences which have made her the way she is and your experiences have been different resulting in you being the way you are. \nSo use this courtship period to iron out all the disagreements rather than running at the first sign of red flag. Atleast two attempts. \nAnd yes, if despite efforts, the red flag does not turn into green, leave. \n\nThat being said, I can understand your rush to leave this match since a bad match will lead to lifelong consequences but for your next match, if not this, I would suggest sticking around a little longer and trying to reach the stage of agreement.",

Why not ask her where this idea of equality is stemming from, how he deduced it, and see if it's possible to have a logical conversation with the other probable future partner. Ask her questions like, if I lose my job, does this mean that u won't support me or be as equal as me, etc etc\n\n2. Everything is a phase. U cannot enter the arranged marriage idea with all green flags and 100% logic.\n\n3. There are many households where women have taken the effort of earning the larger income and looking after the household work and everything for their kids future. Check if she is expecting the man to earn more as generally as a woman, in whatever she does, if she's earning less. There is a whole 9 month maternity + 6 months of care and other things that most people don't take an account of. Many women look for a higher earning partner so that she can concentrate on the whole child thing and not worry about when she has to go back to work to afford something she wants for the child. Like there are many insecurities that pop up when we hear our own mother's struggles as a working mother who handled finances and household work and kids education and all that. The whole idea of a Superwoman is a thankless expectation.\n\n4. If the girl is moving into your house, what she means may be that she wants to keep her money, handle her money, etc than give all of it to you...I have not seen a woman not give the husband money from her savings for bigger investments like house or emergencies or whenever he couldn't pay for it......check the deeper meanings inside these conversations or questions or 'expectations' if you are really looking for a partner. \n\n5. Every word has different meanings. Check if both of u have the same meaning for the word expectation before u assume that it is. \n\n6.

And also for feminism, because feminism supports right to traditional as well as career woman, she must be thinking it in that way. That’s what my guess is. You on the other side, want an egalitarian marriage, which is ok. And to be honest, it will seem unfair if she earns a lot but does not contribute to the household, why?

        "It's actually very common these days. Man's income doesn't go to the woman, it goes towards the general household expenses (electricity, grocery, vacations, etc). \n\nThe woman's income is spent on herself and she doesn't ask the husband for anything. This can include clothes, jewelry, monthly salon/parlour, personal gifting, maid expenses etc. \n\nAnd yes, it is based on the assumption that the man makes more than the woman, so the man spends more (simply bcuz he can & they are a team). Both partners  end up saving approximately the same amount of money. This approach is based on equity, instead of equality. If the woman also contributes 50-50 to household expenses, that would greatly diminish her savings & while the man gets to save a huge portion. This is detrimental to the woman who is also working the same number of hours + contributing to household work + future pregnancy/childcare responsibilities. At least, she should be able to save properly. The 2nd approach is based on this rationale.",
        "You suffer from this type of spouse yourself?",
        "No that's fine. The thing is you will work 10-12 hrs a day and bring 100k per month. She will do 6 hrs, bring 25k and expect you to do 50% or more house work as well in the name of equality.",
        "How much is she asking for alimony?",
        ">Guys cheat with other women by lying to them and saying they’re single / divorced. So yes, blame can’t be on both parties.\n\nOf course because it is scientifically documented that married woman are physically incapable of cheating. It is always married man cheating with young clueless unmarried women.\n\n>She will be giving birth to the kids and her career will suffer a setback because of it. The living expenses like food/ housing should come from the husband.\n\nSo it is retaliation/punishment? Due to biology, he cannot give birth so he has to be financially responsible for everything. And you want him to contribute to other chores too? In this scenario, is the husband human even? Ohh, wait no, all men are pigs, got it.\n\nAlso, if the birthing thing is so problematic, why not adopt?\n\n>There will be no court order since the guy won’t sign the divorce papers till the alimony amount is 0.\n\nYes, because contested divorces and ex parte orders do not exist in Indian judiciary.\n\n>A guy will be living with his gf while still being married to the wife telling the Gf that he’s single. It’s legal in India to be living in with another woman while being married to somebody else. \n\nAny statistics to support your claim here? Since you are of the opinion that all cheaters are married men and they are living with unmarried women and they have all lied that they are single. I really would like to know this.\n\n>The emotional turmoil caused to the woman is unimaginable because in all likelihood the woman doesn’t earn as much as the man does and the house is under joint name - because she financially contributed in the marriage. She doesn’t have a secure roof over her head and has two kids to pay for as well since the guy isn’t signing the divorce papers and hence is not required to pay any maintenance. The legal system in India is super laid back so the question of timely interim maintenance doesn’t arise :)\n\nThen I would say that either you are terribly uneducated about the process or your lawyer is lying to you. Because you definitely can claim interim maintenance in a timely manner.

The basis of the claim for interim maintenance is that the claimant has no independent income of his/her own to support himself/herself.",

They lose the ability to pair bond with one man. You can't do anything because she will call you insecure and or blackmail you of divorce and you will lose everything you worked for. \n\n\n4) woman who's willing to be independent and wants to work even after marriage:\n\n These women will either cheat on you or divorce you if you put pressure on her.. they have been told that if a man leaves you you need to be able to take care of yourself on your own. They will not listen to you, they wont compromise on small things either and will always say 'im an independent working class woman i don't need you' when things won't go in their way. They won't contribute to the family, they won't take up family chores and the higher she earns the lesser she will think of you and may cheat on you. \n\nI've dealt met seen multiple woman in my life including family, friends, colleagues, exes one night stands etc and these are what i have learnt about modern day women.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "So exhausted with unreasonable expectations and sense of entitlement in Indian arranged marriages...",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I have been searching in AM for some time now. While it is expected to run into a few oddballs with unreasonable requirements, I'm finding that this is slowly becoming more widespread. The latest being this girl I talked to recently. The girl liked my profile on jeevansathi and had sent me an invite which I accepted. We exchanged numbers and talked on the phone. The first 2-3 calls went ok as we talked about each other, hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc... basic introduction stuff. Since we found the basic things compatible, we decided to talk further and that is when things started to go south. In the next call, we were talking about each other's expectations, deal breakers, etc. This is where working after marriage came up. I told her that it would be her choice and I would be supportive. She said that she would like to continue working after marriage. I will require support and help from my spouse though, she added. I agreed again, even though i had said the same thing seconds ago. This is when she waved the first red flag. Words like these are easy for boys to say. Your words are meaningless, she said and I was flabbergasted. What else are you expecting me to do on the phone then, I asked. She ignored the question. I'm a bit of a feminist, she said. I expect gender equality everywhere. I'm sure with an understanding partner it is possible, I spluttered. That 'meaningless' comment had thrown me off so I was finding it difficult to be involved in the conversation. We talked about this and that for some more time before I asked, any other expectations? Yes, she said, waving the red flags enthusiastically now. I expect my husband to be financially well off and to be capable of handling the financial responsibilities of home, including our lifestyle. And then she said those fateful words that will forever be etched in my memory, I do not expect to be asked to contribute financially to the marriage in any way. \\[This is exactly the words she used. In that exact order.\\] And. I. Was. Floored. In my head, questions were erupting. You are going to be working too so why is our lifestyle only my responsibility? You want an equal and supportive partner but do not want to be one? Where is the gender equality now? But I only said ok as I was sure that further discussion on this would definitely lead to an argument. I made up some excuse and ended the call. Some hours later when I had settled a bit, I was thinking about the conversation and thought that maybe I should give her the benefit of doubt. May be she did not mean the words in the manner she said it and may have had trouble putting her thoughts forward in a proper way. Ohh, how wrong i was. Because the next day came and in the morning, without any preamble or even a hi, she sent me the link in the chat screenshot below. The Instagram link is a clip from 'The Kapil Sharma Show' of some woman talking about being equal partners. Specifically, that taking care of a house is a hard and full time job, etc... I think of myself as a rational person but when she sent that link, I saw red. I agree that managing a house is not an easy job, especially if you are a working woman but this girl is just coming into this with a 'woe is me' attitude. I had offered her support but she rejected that saying words are easy for boys to say and are meaningless. And yet at the same time, to \"not expect to contribute financially in any way\"? If she is working and if I'm being an equal partner in the house why couldn't she be an equal partner there? She is not doing me a favor by marrying me. It is both our decision to marry to create a life together, so why isn't a stable life as much her responsibility as mine? And what happens if I'm not able to contribute financially? She has made it clear that I can't rely on her. It was clear that the girl had issues but what angered me was her entitlement. The discussion in the screenshots then followed, during which I struggled to stay calm. But at the end of it, I realized that she was not looking for a husband or a partner but someone to bankroll her lifestyle, and she was going to complain the whole way with her victim complex. Any issues which occurred would be because of me and would be my responsibility to resolve, and I could not really rely on her for support. I decided to end it. But the whole thing had made me sour about the process. I want to say that this was the only person like this I encountered but sadly there are many others just like these (and many past the marriage age). I understand that we all have expectations but they should be reasonable and should be what we are willing to put into the marriage too. No one is doing the other a favor by marrying them but it seems that many people think the opposite and expect to get a lot more out of the marriage than what they are bringing to it. End of Rant.

    "light_cleaned_comments": "Man to man talk. This will look highly stupid but this is my take and that's how I proceeded with my girl whom Im gonna marry next year. Bro, forget about money and status and look for a girl much below your status quo. Could also be from your local village. The girl doesn't need to be beautiful or in model standards , most guys mess up this thing in arranged marriage, that lust just takes over while selecting the girl cuz you wanna stand next to a really good looking female. Bruh, naturally after pregnancy they gonna become fat and loose their looks just like you gonna grow tummy and balding head. Forget about these two constants and marry someone who's not a feminist. It's soo easy finding such girls, I swear. She will look after you and your mental peace. These two are enough man, you can earn more money with such a peaceful life rather than this money exchange arrange marriage deals. I know how absurd this sounds. Don't remind me that people 😂. Honestly my girl has nothing financially or look wise to offer me. But everything else a guy can possibly have. @OP, the “not contributing financially” is a red flag, I agree. On the other hand, some people pay the partner who stays at home some sort of salary for the care work they do. Talk it out with her, she sounds like she spent a minute too long on the internet in ultra-feminist / anti-men circles. You dodged a bullet there mate One word of advice you can get sued for posting screenshots without consent.So take those out. Also even if you find an equitable partner,the marriage laws aren't equal.I don't believe that marriages last lifelong so have a look at the divorce laws and don't marry someone without a job.Do not marry by agreeing that you will support her decision to remain a HW.And if you find someone share household chores and responsibilities as fairly as possible. You are describing my life here since last 1 year. I ignored all the above red flags from my stbxw's family and was **stupid** **stupid** **stupid** enough to get hitched. Now seeking divorce. All those demands before marriage multiply by a factor of 100x after marriage. My lesson learnt was - if someone is brazen enough to put forth their stupid (abnormal) demands before marriage, think about their thought process of how brazen they will be after you get married. I am all in for feminism, but against nazi-feminism. Glad you dodged that bullet buddy and hopefully you will find the right one soon. I am not defending the girl, but it feels that you are being too emotionally hurt because the reply she was giving didn't fit your criteria as I can understand. I think you need to move on quickly as this was just one debacle, I would suggest you to keep searching and just move on from this. There is not use debating about the past, and keep a fresh mindset about the next one you find and don't let this problem deter you into believing everyone is the same. Always remember you just have to find the ONE. Welcome to our Best Institution for Marriage:AM Lol pretty much ever woman is looking for someone to bankroll their lifestyle. even the supposedly strong and independent ones. She was a prospect. There's nothing to be gained by OP by trying to change her mind. It's not his problem. \"Not my circus, not my monkey\" would be the way to go here. OP's probably in jail already. Shouldn't have posted those screenshots without consent. Stupid OP. Bullet??? That’s a freaking missile bro dodged there😂😂 I honestly don’t get the point of these posts, the entire thing with unrealistic expectations and whatnot is just so weird. And in the comments there there will always be the guys crying that no one wants to marry them and its better to marry some village girl.. like dude wtf. If girls’ unrealistic expectations were a problem then they would be the ones crying for not getting partners, not the other way around. It’s not your job to fix anyone. If you don’t like them, move on. And seeing how OP just casually shares whatsapp screenshots, it’s just not one person that dodged a bullet. Ghar nahi chalta is logic se > it feels that you are being too emotionally hurt In what manner? Her words angered me but emotionally hurt seems a tad excessive. >because the reply she was giving didn't fit your criteria Also, what criteria? Being an equal and reliable partner? I would think that would be the bare minimum. > don't let this problem deter you into believing everyone is the same As I said, this sadly seems to be quite prevalent. 3 out of 10 girls are saying this in one form or another... Wow! Thankyou for the 30mins of trauma I’m gonna go through post reading this Just curious, can you sue a person even if the identity is hidden? Stay single, stay happy! I don't understand either but I'm fine with it. I forgot reddit is mostly the IT crowd. Their lifestyle is different Thank you 😂 What are you on about, IT ka kya lena bhai See gender equality is a hypothetical term in a marriage, it's never equal, she will do more on few days you will do more on few days and that's how things get balanced, now say for example, you are very ill and she's working whole day at office and in kitchen. Now where's equality? Yeh Bas term hai re, marriage is a co existing bond, it's always 60:40,50:50,30:70 Chalte rehta hai. You should see things more of in terms of equal responsibility. Finance me if she says my money is mine your money is mine then it's wrong, her perspective is wrong over there. She is selfish. Leave it there. A note : this is not her instagram feed speaking, this is her mind speaking. if you take money from her in case of emergency she will say it on your face. Chhod do inhe. She thinks she is entitled. I hope no idiot will fall for her and screw up his life. Good you happened to get her thoughts upfront early enough. For guys who are looking for AM, don't bare everything out and try to be accommodating to everything asked. Be rigid and say NO. Even you are into it equally as her. Dictate your terms when she puts up such nonsense. Make sure to give her back before you cut ties with such prospects, else they think they can continue to behave so with everyone. You would be doing a favor for your brotherhood then. Kisi ke toh gaand me fategi. There's no PII data anywhere in the screenshots, either for OP or her. Take a chill pill. Hope your divorce settlement is resolved quickly. Best wishes ! what's stbxw? Bhai jaldi se kanni kat le isse Vrna kal agar shadi ho gai na isse to naak mein dum kar degi tumhari or tumhari family ke Aisi cherry picking feminist se dur raho bhai Yeah just like there's no point of posting anything related to harassment, crimes, scams, frauds etc. It's your life suck it up and deal with it. Why bother posting it on the internet? /s Let’s pray for that guy. Or hope she comes into reality understanding her fairly tale Instagram world doesn’t exist in real life Agreed. This post and the comment section just feels like an excuse to hate on “feminism”. You’re so right about the fact that despite all of these womens’ unrealistic demands, it’s always only posts by men I see that are super frustrated. Would be so easy to just move on but no, let’s get on an entire gender and a humanist movement that has nothing to do with this scenario 💀 Bro everyone wants a safe, secure and better future than the present reality. Unfortunately money is the only way to get these things. I would advise you to not indulge in such conversation over WhatsApp initially and rather sit with her and observe her perspective. If her mind doesn’t align with yours, you have no option but to move on peacefully brother! Bullet nahi brahmos 'Talk it out with her' Yuck!!! Baap re, itne downvotes. Kya galat boldiya. You are absolutely right sir. My opinion was I wouldn't even go for such a working girl in first place. I hope now I'm clear. Again I say you are right, when she got money, she has to contribute to her partner. How can she sue him bro. She doesn't have money, will need a husband for that Not sure why you are being downvoted, but your view point is correct along most parameters mentioned. There is more than beauty in a relationship and compatibility, compromise, peace are some equally important aspects which people tend to forget. Have upvoted you! Yeah that's not very feminist of her and it's ridiculous that such people even are even allowed to call themselves that. The feminists don't want her and condemn these expectations, which could have been sorted out by actually discussing how each person would contribute in the household stuff. OP dodged a massive bullet. Yeah, leaking chats is a dodgy AF thing to do, no matter what. Agreed, but he should not just receive nonsense from her. He too should punch back before closing the interaction. Else, she would think she is always right. Bro dodged what Israel fired at Gaza Some people are able to come to reason by talking it over. I find it so sad how nowadays people are like “yeah, I had a disagreement, let’s nip this connection in the bin and get a new one” And I don't get the point of these comments and yet here we are. If you don't like rant posts don't read them. The title is clear enough and so is the flair. The point of this post is to vent at the sorry state of affairs, nothing else. > If girls’ unrealistic expectations were a problem then they would be the ones crying for not getting partners, not the other way around. See, the thing is that the demand is so skewed so they will get someone agreeing to the unreasonable expectations. But then reality will change after marriage and then they will be crying for other issues. I can show you so many subs dedicated to that if you want. >And seeing how OP just casually shares whatsapp screenshots, it’s just not one person that dodged a bullet There is not a single identifying feature in that screenshot. I have cropped or erased every single one, even the instagram share id in the link she shared. I am just providing proof corroborating my experience so that people do not think I am just pulling this from my ass. I am sure there would have been people saying that. >stbxw Soon to Be Ex Wife Why do people try to see a future with someone who doesn't even text at their level.. bhai itne mein hi kat leti mai toh See, there are two options: 1) Absolute Equality - Both partners work, earn similar amounts/work similar hours, they come home and do 50% of the household chores. Everything is 50-50 here. 2) Partial equality/equity - Both partners are working. The woman usually earns less than her male spouse (since women in AM tend to marry men older & more experienced than them). In this case, the wife feels that her income should be reserved for her personal spending and/or emergency situations like if the husband suddenly loses his job. Otherwise, almost all financial responsibilities will be on the man while almost all household duties will be on the woman. In the second setup, there is more equality than in the traditional housewife+earning man arrangement since the wife is not fully financially dependent on you. But it also recognizes that traditionally men were the bread earners while women have only started working since the last 2-3 generations. Some women feel that them working is a big enough contribution since anyway the household work will fall on them + pregnancy + child rearing. 🤷 The world will never be equal no matter how hard we try because of biological differences. From your chats, it seems like the girl has trouble believeing that you will actually support her/contribute to household stuff etc. So she is clarifying her stand beforehand that she won't contribute financially and is preparing herself for other duties - bcuz she feels she will have to contribute a lot more than you, in terms of household & child rearing duties, regardless of what you say right now. There are millions of idiots roaming around on the streets. She was just one of them. There's no point trying to change her mind. Just like I won't bother trying to change your mind any more :) Soon to be ex wife, I guess. OP please look for educated people.Her english made my head pain not ache(lol)...If someone is educated,they would actually be able to support the other person in testing times.Op that means you might have to compromise on looks,age etc.What I often see is people expecting things in a package agewise,degreewise amongst other [things.You](https://things.You) cant have it all. Lol. You are looking for a partner via the arranged marriage system and expecting people to be...what? Leaking private messages and acting like a victim. What kind of chores are you willing to do in the house? Are you ready to split it beforehand and stick to the system before entering wedlock? How did you narrow down the women you \"picked\" on the website while hunting for a bride? Really. Of course, this post will be full of men whining about \"nazi-feminism\" and shit like that. Do you even know what the nazis were? Are you even willing to take accountability for your role in why a relationship failed? Don't want patriarchal expectations tied around your neck? Then don't go \"searching\" in AM. LOL. she belongs to the streets, keep your head high king Your words are meaningless j/k 🤭 Bit of a feminist ka matlab hai she wants all the rights fulfilled while she makes 0 effort for your rights. Bhaag bhai. Dude YIKES Maybe because marriage is not supposed to be a business deal, and it's a shame that that is a norm in India? You had me until you said \"way past the marriage age\" More like Jab koi iski gaand me hoga tb fategi You are right about the patriarchy part in AM, but a lot of people don't really have the luxury to go down the path of love marriage. Cease contact, block, and move on. You do not need to do anything more than that. She is a smart person; it is up to her to determine if what she expects from a marriage is a fair deal for both partners or not. It is not your duty to correct her; let life be her lesson or let her become someone else's problem/lesson if they are not careful like you were. There is nothing to be gained in trying to educate or argue with her about this or dwelling too much on what makes her think the way she does. How... is your comment funny? she's pretty My guy, you are looking wayyyy too much into this. There was no crime, there was no fraud, there was no scam. It’s good that the OP realised that the girl he was seeing was not a good match and backed off. What’s not ok is this self victimisation and like so many other people said, dragging an entire gender under the bus just because he had a bad experience. that is when you run away from her when she said no i dnt ... lol dumbo beach Bruh... You chose the arranged marriage route. What were you expecting? ask her for her cibil score and you will know the truth You are not ready for marriage. If you can't take care of a women you aren't ready. I really get what you are saying and I agree with you. There are people in India forced into marriages and that's really not ok (also very illegal). They are also emotionally forced into marriages by parents and well...that sucks too. That having been said... marriage is not a right...it's a choice you make. This person clearly has a job, seems to be eloquent enough, and is fielding interested parties. He hates the system? The system is very much flawed. It's steeped in tradition that hurts both men *and* women. Yes, this girl seems confused in life and rude. But some of my female friends have been put through HELL when they went down this route. One of them was called a slut because she ate eggs. One of them was told she was beyond ugly because she wasn't \"fair\" and was a marathon runner (so she will get darker running under the sun). Most of my friends were asked whether or not they were virgins. One guy straight up tried assault. Yes, this girl was a dick. But leaking DMs? Getting everyone to also trash on her? She was rude. Ok? So? What's the marriage age lmao? Does over 30 not make the cut? Isn't that what girls do as well? If they meet one family that demands dowry or expects them to do household chores they shame the entire gender. They even shame them when they themselves haven't been through this experience, they've just read it somewhere or heard it from someone. My girlfriend is the germ, I am lucky to have her. Already married. You were thinking so much and giving her the benefit of doubt, trust me you if you go ahead with this you will be giving yourself a world of hurt Bro you dodged a himars rocket atacm Lol, so many things wrong in your comment that I don't know where to begin. But I can see that you are just a troll (as evidenced by your phrase \"hunting for a bride\") so I am not going to engage you. Go away troll. Not today! P.S. Although I will clarify about \" leaking private messages\" There is not a single identifying feature in that screenshot. I have cropped or erased every single one, even the instagram share id in the link she shared. I am just providing proof corroborating my experience so that people do not think I am just pulling this from my ass. As we are sure there are people doubting my experience. some of today's indian women seems to be the worst. they want all the independence and the support like women in the west do. which is the right thing. but they also want to be coddled and carried around financially while contributing nothing to the relationship, outside of her \"frustrations\" and attitude. They dont want the responsible attitude f the west. they will never marry someone who's financially weaker than them. they will never marry someone who they think is of \"lower class\" than them. Thank you and I'll delete before I stand at 200 downvotes 😂 These guys can't understand love. It's all about money and money. I'm not denying it isn't important. But someone who resonates with your interests, well being, care and a partner without ego is more than anything that money is gonna give me. Thanks for agreeing though. Bhai, women are like this only. Can't write the way I would like to because then my post would be removed as a Hate Speech post. Basically feminism and equality are contrary to each other, however, feminists and other advocates of the fairer sex demand both. Just like your to-be did in her conversation with you. They just want a good, life without having to work or pay for it. (Very controversial and I will be downvoted for sure for this.) But men who have experienced this will agree with me. Women themselves don't know what they want but they just keep throwing words like equality and empowerment, without actually wanting to be an equal partner in every way. They'll be quick to take advantages of being a woman (like in a long queue or taking favours) but otherwise they want to be treated equally. It's all very hypocritical. Just stay single and stay happy! Arranged Marriage: Its all about brokering the best deal Dodged a bullet here. One advice. Such conversations, have them face to face or at least on video calls. There are a lot of emotions involved and text communication, its easy to miss context or the tone from the other side. Either way in this case the outcome would be the same. Your emotional intelligence far exceeds anything she’s capable of. Let’s just say a prayer for the person she’s going to marry lol you pretty much summed up my story mate. I had convos with few prospects and I swear to god, those were exactly the same in terms of traits what you’ve described above. So opinionated also straightforward with the fact that they’ll contribute zero/zilch financially and it will be solely my responsibility since, I earn 10x then those prospects. Can anyone explain why these women's expectations have gone through the roof? why do they think that anyone will accept these demands? Guilt tripping by the poster above you And they are called out for that? Aren’t you familiar with the whole not all guys thing? It's like \"your money is our money but my money is only my money\" mentality\" Modern feminist. Wants all the benefits but no responsibility. You dodged a bullet Wise words How open are you to the idea of remaining unmarried? This reminds me of an old saying by a Great Gold Digger“Your money is our money my money is my money” What is the name of the sub you are talking about? Dude, you are right. I believe you. This other commenter is just another one of the feminism bandobast. Tell her to pitch in equally and all they then desire is MOOV. Bhaai bata de kaun hai.. main bhi dhund raha hoon, bach jauga.. Reading those chats were making my eyes bleed man 😭 When your prospect says she is a feminist,it's time for you to close the interaction. Them identifying as Feminist probably means they want all the benefits with none of the responsibility and on top of that they will be heavily argumentative and will cause constant problems in your marriage unless you let them walk all over you. At least this one was upfront about her motives. Yeah props for the flair. The entire skewed demand makes no logical sense. If every girl was marrying above then the top 10% would be single. That doesn’t seem like the case. And no, anecdotal evidence doesn’t work. I live in a joint family and two of my sisters that got married had higher financial status and packages then their husbands. I don’t get to extrapolate. Again props for not including any personal information but if your point was to legitimise your post then well, its not hard to get two numbers. On the other hand it just comes off as too emotionally immature. Those texts were meant for you, sharing them for whatever reason is never right. after reading first 2 paras of your post 2nd option ending is far fetched don’t you think? Saving is good, but in this case I don’t think she mean that. There's going to be a desparate simp who'll wife her up. Women always find their bag \\[30M\\] Ignored all these same things last year and got married Feb 2022 and 10 October 2023 marked the last day of my married life with a full and final divorce. Done with the AM thing and out of this marriage thing for life. I recognise and agree with these 3 options you laid out. My husband and I have gone through 2 of those. In the first few months of marriage, my husband was the sole earner and I took on 99.9% of housework load. At present, he has quit his job and is back in college for his master’s degree. Now I’m the sole earner and I still take on more than 50% of the housework. As for the future, we have discussed and agreed on proportionally equitable contributions - if he earns more/works more hours, I’ll pitch in more unpaid labour at home and he pitches in more money. In the end, it’s about communicating your expectations with respect for the other person’s needs and capabilities. Most people are in helpless situation.. they don't want to mess up their life's and see the family trauma for free.. however am is also the same.. but it is always something like this post by OP Poor guy On point. Indian society is just changing its views, and women are starting to be vocal. Before a huge change there is always some turbulence before reaching a stable ground. I often think that Indian women are just adjusting to the change, understanding differed POVs, learning new concepts, learning about their rights and how life could be different. And in the process obviously there will be time when you come across a concept and it might look right initially but then when you give it a deep thought, you will find flaws in it and similarly you might find yourself stuck with an ofd notion and with some time you will release that it actually made sense. My point being, sometimes it will take some time to wrap your head around a concept, understand it from different POVs, and decide if it works for you. Mistakes happen, when it does accept it, think rationally and make a change. That is what makes a person incredible. So to all the women out there, embrace change, toss out the bads and never give up on the goods 🥂 Lol emotional intelligence? Dude is sharing their chats with strangers. This girl is confused and is totally red flag from my side too. Bruh. Don't marry her. On the bright side, she’s revealed it sooner than later. Some people don’t reveal this side until 2-3 years into the marriage. This one's gonna drop onto a hospital. What is AM Fr This makes sense lol. Men will be men Startup idea. Make an app where people anonymously can share their opinion/experience with an individual and rate them, just like reviews in google maps. Don't ask me further question, because I got no clue how it can be practically implemented. There's no point in replying to idiots who feel full of themselves. In hindsight, she may have wanted to back out and wanted to make you look bad as if you were not compromising. That's how some women behave, pretty pathetic! She knows pretty well what she is asking is unfair but rolls the dice anyway to see how much of a fool you are. Anyway, the society will believe a woman's word. You have an option since this is AM. You can share your disgust with her family, lecture them morally even. Next time she will think twice before making such points. The first red flag you are indicating is the reality of Indian society. She is totally correct. Here, boys first agree, but later on, they refuse to support their partner's decision to work under their parents influence. Her way of saying it is not correct. She is looking for a supportive partner who supports her in every aspect of life, whether it's career or household. These are not demands but expectations that everyone has, like the one you had from her to contribute financially. You are looking from your own perspective, not from hers. She brings a lot to the table, whether you agree or not. She was trying to explain it to you by sending the short. But you look at it personally. Good that you are making a quick decision. On the side note, these kind of entitled behavior is not new in India. We are just seeing on both sides now. Working women had no rights on their income. Had to spend on marriages of husban'd siblings, parents healthcare and their loans ..but not allowed to spend on her family. This unfair behavior has always been a thing. I would largely blame parents here. They heavily indulge in personal matters and kind of screw marriages. Why not find someone organically, instead of this flawed system of arranged marriages! What a nightmare! This is what Modern Feminism is preaching. We don't want men attitude but then we want them to support our cause. For them equality is selective only until it favors them. I understand that. I used the words \"gender equality\" because she did. And for me equality does not mean that my responsibility ends at 50% no matter what. In fact, I would be more than willing to go above and beyond for the person I care about. They're called out for blaming the entire gender. This I agree with. They're not (or should not be) called out for posting it online. They (both the genders) want a platform to vent. The Internet provides that platform. The opportunists have hacked the feminism movement so badly that it's almost a negative when someone say they are feminist... Vast majority of feminists I've seen are unreasonable and want to be funded n kept in a pedestal because some men are evil... Why every man has to pay for some men's sin... The expectation to not contribute for expense is a huge redflag.. Be thankful that this came up soon enough. Many just hide their True colors!! She sounds hurt. I’d stay away Yes then chill out, she is just self centred. Try organically, try to go some hobby club or something. Make a normal friendship you may find someone. > she's pretty Nowhere did I objectify her. These are your words. >Why do people try to see a future with someone who doesn't even text at their level. Because I feel like I should try to understand people and see where they are coming from rather than outright rejecting based on \"texting skills\" (at least in AM scenario). Amazing answer! Marriage is not even 60:40, 50:50 etc, it has to be 100:100. Plus OP as you are going through these demands in AM scenarios, opposite gender it in same shoes. They have been asked to work, take care of home, child etc hence frustration from both side. Of course, I’m not defending the point to finance lifestyle but you have to understand in marriage there are contributions that cannot be monetise. Dude, the moment you hear a girl say she is a feminist (a bit or not ), hang up that phone man..it's not worth it. Ah yeah you ran into the ones who are being forced to talk to prospective matches and doing their best to drive them away by saying the most absurd shit possible. Keep looking OP. Simps aadmio ,ghatiya webseries ne inke bohat bhaav Bina baat ke badha rakhe hai Op seems to be reading too much into it. Can be a perspective but I have seen some explanation in this by some women who believes that men are bread earner of family and should do same and since they will be taking responsibility of their own expenditure they will be saving money anyways. Sort of a mixture of both ideologies Yikes. What a charming young lady. I think I'm in love. If the OP had made this post without the chat screenshot then would it have been Ok ? I am sorry if you misunderstood my message, you seem fine with the whole overdeal and hope you find the one 😊 If that's the case then clearly it's a communication gap here The fact is men are being destroyed completely in marriages nowadays. Earning income is not easy and the fact someone wants to bankroll their lifestyle through marriage is fucking incredible. Arrange marriage should be the last resort... Sadly some poor dude will fall into the trap and marry her. Feeling bad for him already Yehi communication skills jhel liyo zindagi bhar 😂 she's clearly not giving you the same energy you're asking for Off topic but we really need to get rid of the idea that if someone doesn't have a strong command over English then they must be uneducated. In this case however it definitely seems to be the case. I hear there is a great opening for a baba in a nearby ashram. Thinking of applying... So just wanna make it clear You are saying that dono certain percentage of paise contribute karenge apni income ki proportion ke hisab se and agar let's say wo jyada earn karta hai to tum Ghar pe jyada contribute karoge and vice versa Sry meri English it I acchi nahi to just wanted to make things clear Don't take it to heart, she might be new and trying to see if she can find a \"sucker\". She'll come in line after a few experiences like yours. Good you said no, should've shut her down a bit harder, but yeah lot more people are like her now, both guys and girls. Stop searching for arranged marriage and fall in love organically? You're more likely to find someone compatible with you that way. Stop counting the years. Marriage shouldn't be an important goal in life. Sex is available even without it. I don't usually agree with these rants and feels like AITA are just true. But in this case you are in the right. She did the classic pseudo feminist thing of requiring everything and not giving anything in return. Yes Wahi bola mene, i am just saying it proportion wise, it's obvious that if two people are doing they have to do hundred percent. I agree with you. You’re not in the wrong here she’s delusional stay clear.. if you’re willing to have kids please make sure your future spouse is good with kids.. that’s the only advice I can give you. Good work bro, you did good It's a big red flag that someone talks about equality and not willing to do the same that's just plain hypocrisy Thanks for all the props. > If every girl was marrying above then the top 10% would be single. What doesn't make sense is this sentence. I never said \"every girl\". I never said \"marrying above\". Why are you attributing a sentence you made up to me and asking me to justify? I said, that even with the unreasonable expectation, someone is going to agree to it. That sentence is logical enough. >And no, anecdotal evidence doesn’t work. I live in a joint family and two of my sisters that got married had higher financial status and packages then their husbands. Here I would like to return one of the props to you for the creative way you used anecdotal evidence without using it. > but if your point was to legitimise your post then well, its not hard to get two numbers I would have to be morally bankrupt to do that so no but thanks for the suggestion. Off topic but you can't just marry after a few conversations. Like if you had built a deep relationship with her you might've known why she said something as 'red flaggy' as that. Maybe some friend put that idea into her head or she might be in a bad mood and was being self sabotage-y. All I'm saying is that when you actually get to know a person you realise that things aren't what they seem. I'm this case you might be right though > just stay single Yes. Yes, you should. Yes 🙌 Mujhe kisi ne shakal dekh kar na kar dia..ye sab gyaanbaji sunkar mujhe lagta hai mere sath bahut accha hua..what a children of flux we are.. She was managing her own profile and she had reached out. She was managing her own profile and she had reached out. I am a female and I agree with all of what you said. In the name of feminism, girls today are looking for an ATM and a full-time servant. They have no idea that they have to contribute to the relationship too. True that men can be the same way. But whoever thinks that the other person should bear all the responsibility - should not marry. Yeah it's a thing these days. They show their parents that they are indeed talking to prospective matches to get them off their backs while they continue living their lives. It's very effective. >I'm not defending her BUT then goes on to defend her, jfc🤦 let's not act like there is no marriage age Are you dumb? Based on her views it is abundantly clear she wants: 1) your money is my money and my money is also my money type situation 2) also all household chores have to be split equally Its very obvious that it's not the \"2nd situation\" as you've described. But good job acting like a faux feminist and defending an entitled mooch woman baby online. All I’m saying not to jump to conclusions. Try to talk to her and if OP still feels the same, of course move on and don’t marry. In general, women in India have to sacrifice more and have to contribute more, so it’s difficult to have clear 50:50 or equality here. only thing she brings to the table is her ego and narcissistic personality larped with feminist ideals that has no co relation with reality whatsoever Countering one anecdotal evidence with another, props to you. Agree with you. The 2nd option is what works for most people and I think that lady there is keen for that 2nd option. Congrats you dodged something you wouldn't regret and ig you are not regretting now either. Baaki Mata g se bolo. Vo dhoodh lenge ladki baaki. So you are saying he should select a future partner based on their ability to text clearly? Yes her view for money is wrong. But it could have discussed politely. And said you can keep both of your finances separate. But, I find it absolutely horrible that you shared a screen shot personal conversation to publicly shame her.( ya ya sure, name wasn't released ) I would never date let alone marry a guy who can publicly shame a women. Because this type behavior is peak red flag for me. Aaj screen shot hai kal revenge porn hoga . Uss ladki ne joh bola usse correct karo politely and move on. Par screen shot post karke publicly mazak banana is pretty shitty. Here a point you missed. Have you thought maybe she was thinking differently. Her not contributing to finaces may also have a factor of abuse women get. There are multiple modern cases when the husband expects his wife to go to work just after delivery because 1 salary isn't enough. It happens . Another reason is lack of women in the marriage market. A lot of guys and their families are ok with women doing nothing in the marriage and these are actually from influential families, wives of top beauracrats, bas shaadi kar lo. And women get those choices that easily. Think about it in way a guy a offering easy life and another is offering hard life people are going to choose easy life. My cousin sister is pretty she had no job graduated from tier 1 college, but she married a guy who had no demand and with Indian salary of 70 lakhs with age difference of 1 year and no dowry. And he is good looking. Honestly as someone who has a younger brother, take this advice . The guys who are sympathetic to you here will adjust will all t&c when they see pretty women . Moreover, these most of demands are set by fathers or approved by fathers of these women because its a competition between fathers to marry their daughters to rich men. So, forget money matters because parental generation killed girls so now women have power play in marriage market and money is important for all. Find a girl who is kind, compassionate and responsible and adjust. Everyone does. >These are not demands but expectations that everyone has, like the one you had from her to contribute financially To be fair, that was not my demand/expectation. we had not discussed finances till then. She herself had brought it up and it was at odds to her own requirement for an equal partner in the marriage. Sadly, she never asked my expectations. What is there to talk about? She clarified two things : 1) her money and his money, both are her money 2) all household chores have to be split equally (based on the fiminist posts she's sharing with him) If that's not the clearest possible indication that she's an entitled, wanna be mooch, woman baby, idk what is. The fact that you're defending this person, even when she's shown how shallow and hypocritical she is, just shows you're biased against men. Hey OP, can I ask you something? Why do you want to get married? Run A self respecting feminist would never put herself in the arranged marriage market in the first place. >Marriage is not even 60:40, 50:50 etc, it has to be 100:100. Bhai, 50:50 and 100:100 are the same. lol Lot of these ugly, fat, past marriageable age women foolishly think they have lot of options available due to all the Simps our there. But the reality is that they don't. They find it out the hard way, when their biological clock starts ticking & their ovaries get fried. Men don't go anywhere near them & reject them. Girls like these remain unmarried. If it matters to him, yeah. Among other things. lol. Calm your tities! All I’m saying that clear it out rather than jumping to conclusions. In WhatsApp chat, she sent it without any hidden motive. Someone watching ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’ is a big ass bullet in itself. \"His money is our money and my money is my money.\" Lmao She’s a pseudo feminist dude. They have no idea what actual feminism and equal rights entail. These people just look up reels on Instagram and think that’s feminism. More like feminazi in my view. Also, get over this whole past the marriage age thing. Yes, there is a biological clock for women in terms of having a kid and all but there’s enough options through science these days to get around that. Depends there are good proposals too in arrange marriages I may not know since I am young to be there. However I know that a self respecting woman will not do - his money my money but my money only mine hehe. A feminist doesn't sound like her. This has everything to do with \"feminism\" and nothing to do with AM... Yaar...marry a flawed but reasonable person. In any txn the less cunning person(man or woman) gets grifted, stay safe. Girls and guys bring in some weird preconceived ideas into the marriage which sometimes gets sorted and detangled but the person has to be \"reasonable\". And guys or girls who appropriate victimhood of the community are the worst kind of selfish people and they demean the actual victims. Accountability is feminist's kryptonite. You didn’t say every girl but in your mind if it was just a few, you wouldn’t have made this post. People don’t use phrases like ‘sorry state of affairs’ when addressing about a small population. And coming to your unrealistic expectations part, if people are agreeing to it then how is it unrealistic? That’s called knowing your worth. Something us guys don’t understand. And if this creates problems in the future then it is 100% the guy’s fault. The girl was clear with what she wanted. Not her fault that the guy is a desperate, immature adult. Lmao you are accusing me of using anecdotal evidence while conveniently skipping over ‘I don’t get to extrapolate’, thus completely changing the meaning what I said. Dude the comment was right above and you still skipped it like no one would know. We can’t even what all things you missed in your original story, and going by the fact that you conveniently posted screenshots of your private conversations just shows your emotional maturity and ‘morals’ that you are swinging around. 🤣🤣 Please don't take me wrong OP and try to understand what I am trying to say. In AM girls are really insecure initially, they are scared AF and try to sound all feminist even to the extent of sounding like Nazi feminist just to put up a brave face and kinda test you I agree with a few comments here that this one in particular wasn't giving the same energy as seen in the text screenshot but if you are up for AM, kindly give some more time to the prospective match. Try to talk more and especially on issues like this. Feminist but doesn't want to contribute. Irony. >Indian arranged marriages Enough said. Run as far from it as possible, even if it means temporarily severed relationships. How is everyone just missing the ‘I don’t get to extrapolate’ part? That’s meant to say just because I have 2 samples that say one thing, I don’t get to use them to attribute the entire population. What is cibil score ? Ah yes, the modern woman, strong and Independent in everything except accountability. its shows the credibility of you with repaying the amount or loan taken by you from banks or cc He's taking one for the team guys. Mad respect 🤙🏻 Hey man, if you have the energy, what went wrong? Do you think you could have done something differently which would have no resulted in a divorce? Prayers are necessary for whoever is taking this one 🫡 “60-70% you will get” - Seema Aunty 😂🤣🤣 You're lucky you found out her personality right away. My uncle realised his wife's wonky personality and character only after marriage and having kids. He's stuck in it now. Bro just dodged a bullet. Mami/Chachi ke ghar me dekh lo koi theek lage toh. I've come to understand that life must be lived in a gender neutral way, where you can earn, feed, clean and protect yourself without relying on anyone. Only then, when you decide to share your life, can you share it as a team and not as dependents to eachother. For years, I was conditioned as a little girl, into understanding what my role should be in life through society. But it was actually unconditioning and relearning that helped me snap out of it. Then I realised, it's not just the women who are conditioned but also the men in different aspects. For instance, right after college, I didn't get a job immediately and just travelled through the country, funded by my past work of teaching children art. But my guy friends didn't have this privilege, as soon as they graduated, they were expected to get a job and contribute at home by their families.. So I take it easy. I try to look at a person as a human being regardless of their gender. Alot of the people aren't able to snap out of identifying themselves in gender defined roles. Cooking, cleaning, earning money, and being able to protect yourself are basic life skills that every human should know, despite the gender. I also realised that once I was able to do the 4, and find a partner who could also do the 4, our life and love is much more natural, authentic and evolving -together. Sharing responsibilities is a beautiful experience together. To stand with eachother vs the world. So maybe, while you're in this journey of finding a partner, it will help to understand if they can play these 4 roles independently. If they can, and so can you; it will be a want-based relationship and not a need-based one. I hope you find a partner who advocates and lives in true-equality, and not faux. And feminists are expert liars too. That’s a Black Mirror episode He's probably in prison for being naughty. I agree she is unreasonable when she says she won't contribute financially. Totally wrong. But but but....when she said boys say these meaningless words....i feel she has seen the patriarchy around her and is being overly cautious. You may not have given her any signs of not being an unreasonable partner, but please see from her point of view. Marriages around us in current times are not the prime example of equality and it's understandable that she is suspicious of every man's intention despite them not giving any direct signs. So I would advise you not to take that part personally and instead maybe allow her a window inside your feminist beliefs so that she is assured of her choice of partner. Hence for next time, I would say have an elaborate discussion on this aspect without being immediately defensive. Remember it's not about you, it's how society is. But that does not give anyone a free pass to use their partners income without contributing at all. I do not stand by that at all. I am a feminist. But the word here should be equity and not equality. My salary is comparatively less than my husband's but I make sure to take care of my own expenses including clothing, make-up and toiletries, office fare, occasionally eating out, and so on; order medicines for him and mother-in-law, and many similar spendings. In last 2 years of our marriage, I haven't exactly asked him to bear any cost for my spendings. I can afford it, so why should he step in unless there is an emergency? I also save some of my paycheck for future uses. He has taken care of me in all possible ways, I make sure to not to burden his pocket when I am earning. Yeah, you did dodge a cannon here, not even a bullet. Also, my now husband tested me before he formally asked to marry me. He told me his paycheck was lower than what he mentioned on the matrimonial website. At that time I didn't hesitate, I simply told him that he was right in checking a woman's golddigger tendencies as marriage is a pious bond and should be based on love, respect, affection and understanding with a stable financial base. I didn't realise that it was a test. However, a few days later he finalized me as his match and met my family to cement his decision. Even with my not so great salary I do not put any burden on my husband. It's good that you didn't marry her. Such women give bad reputation to feminists. Agree with OP! They are of all kinds.... some are feminist till it suits them that I will agree with. Like we saw the one OP met. Learnt to be respectful to people you don't personally know. Starting your reply with \"Are you dumb\" says more about you than it does about the person you are attempting to label as dumb. Kinda ironic since my main comment was about understanding people, instead of automatically labelling/dismissing them lol. As for the reply to the rest of your comment, I did not defend anyone. I tried to explain to OP that there are mainly 3 types of arrangements in marriage nowadays, what the girl he's talking to MIGHT be having in mind, and that he needs to talk it out and decide what kind of arrangement HE wants for himself. He can even present these options to her and tell her to choose. Going around labelling women as \"faux feminist\" bla bla isn't going to help anyone in the long run. I say he dodged a failed marriage This entitlement Goes all the way...You absolutely could not expect same pitching from female gender...Have Same Experience..but putting up with her somehow. Not ability to text but the ability to communicate clearly. While the guy is sending paragraphs putting forth his concerns all she said is 'there is no meaning in explaining' like bhai you are getting to know each other to get married you must communicate clearly. How else is he supposed to understand or even deal with it at all, what should he conclude when you give him no explaination huh? What is AM? Didn't read the wall of text. Stopped exactly where it says \"I am bit of feminist\". You shouldave called it a day, bid her farewell and moved on, right at that point. You / me / any man could have billions of problems but FEMINIST SHOULDN'T BE ONE OF THEM. Avoid at all cost. Any women who claim to be feminist are either toxic or in a path to be toxic in the future. True women don't call themselves feminists. (This my opinion and you dont have to care or respect it) Some people go for the \"% of our income or number of hours worked\" method while others blatantly declare that the man will take up financial responsibilities since the woman usually ends up with the majority of the familial, children, & household responsibilities. Percentage of income sounds more fair to me, but to each their own :) It's all finding what works for you as a couple and not judging others who want different things. You both clearly need to understand yourselves first about what you exactly want before trying to understand each other I just laid out all the options. 2nd one is trending based on the experiences/posts I've seen on social media. But I agree that it can be a bit far fetched since one person gets to save everything and the other doesn't. Only she knows what she meant. OP can communicate more clearly (if he wants to) and find out what she is hoping for. Arranged Marriage #notallwomen What's a good range? My ICICIBank account shows 787-827 and asks for money for exact score. So, am I good, bad, or ~~ugly~~ poor as hell? Arranged Marriage. Haa matlab unko keh do ye bhi sahi rahegaa baaki aap baat kr skte hoo. I just prayed for you. No 498A complaint, right? Read the WhatsApp screenshots, the girl can't even articulate and hold a conversation. Why is op even bothering engaging with her. Enlightened bro was about to lose all his property... 😌 Arrange marriage >Why do people try to see a future with someone who doesn't even text at their level.. bhai itne mein hi kat leti mai toh. hahahhaa true that! I saw the chat screenshots OP posted and the 'cool', 'cool' were hella annoying. They don't seem compatible at all. More red flags than a communist parade. We are now witnessing the effects of third wave feminism in the west that resulted in enormous cases of divorces, alarming number of children growing in single mother households and the society at it's core falling apart to darkness. Women destroyed themselves and the Indians are adopting that rubbish feminism from the West, and calls it FREEDOM. When does the women learn from the mistakes of the past, and when will they return to their innate feminine nature? We need the rest of the chat OP!!! What the woman from the screenshots is demanding is not feminism. The word's definition itself has the word equality in it. Anybody that behaves like this is a fake feminist at best. And the source of my frustration for setting the feminist movement back. No meanings bro no meanings Dude you are absolutely in the right here, and dodged a lot of stress in the future. In your next meetings with anyone else, bring this point early on. I have come across many women expecting the guy to take care of everything financially and not do anything themselves, and I blame it on the lack of being taught responsibility, and in many cases, these were people who have just stayed with their parents or are lazy. Its all about splitting the work - managing the house and financials, if you cant contribute to one of them you need to pick up the other one, doesn't matter if you are a man or woman. Lol you deserve better! Just make sure you know someone's character well and take time before your AM, cause all sorts of people lie and even act just to change after the wedding! Satark raho doston 🤣🤣 Quick tip for fellow aspirants: next time ask the girl what will she bring to the table, what role will she play in managing the family responsibilities? It is OP thats not arguing, it is she who is pressing demands. If the situation was reversed, would you say the same things ? If OP demanded I want X, I want Y, I want you to do XYZ, would you side with OP and give the benefit of the doubt. I HIGHLY doubt that. Misogyny much? Hopefully you realize that obviously not every woman is looking for that. Don't go down that woman hating rabbit hole friend. It's dark there. Why would you even engage someone with such horrible grammar? I don’t hate women lol Learn to comprehend what you read, stop making up your own shit What's AM? >She’s a pseudo feminist dude. They have no idea what actual feminism and equal rights entail. These people just look up reels on Instagram and think that’s feminism. More like feminazi in my view. > >Also, get over this whole past the marriage age thing. Yes, there is a biological clock for women in terms of having a kid and all but there’s enough options through science these days to get around that. The most feminist woman I have met in my life is my European colleague who has never uttered the word feminism. Any person who starts a conversation with \"Im a bit of a feminist\" is BOUND to be a red flag. IT is as if her whole personality is feminism. lmao. Simp\\* \"Pretty much every woman is looking someone to bankroll\" You're certainly not loving women. Responsibility without authority is slavery It’s a fact How many women would marry an uneducated man with no job and no possibility of getting a job? Not even one Fuck that, how many women would marry a man who wanted to stay home and raise the kids, be a house-husband? How many men would do the same? A lot more than women Men and women value different things. Facts are facts. They don't marry you , they marry your lifestyle. Look for house wife. These feminist type working girls will bring nothing except entitlement and headache in your life. Find better players. Dont blame the game Actually yes! I would say the same. Going thru this process is very frustrating. 80% people don’t know what they want and how marriage works. They are in their own bubble. As OP said, initially it was good, so I guess I could be some misunderstanding or gap in communication. Hence I suggested to discuss it like an adult and if he still feels l this not his cup of tea then move on. more like sugargirl. good It's good >Also, my now husband tested me before he formally asked to marry me. He told me his paycheck was lower than what he mentioned on the matrimonial website. At that time I didn't hesitate, I simply told him that he was right in checking a woman's golddigger tendencies as marriage is a pious bond and should be based on love, respect, affection and understanding with a stable financial base. Thats very mature of you to take that well, kudos. *fake feminist A modern feminist would be someone who believes in the correct definition of feminism in today's world. AKA believes in equality in 2023. You aint wrong, the most \"feminist\" woman I have ever met in my life has never uttered these words, works as hard (or even harder) than us, has clear leadership/empathic qualities. Its like tywin said, any man who says I am the king is no true king. If I ask you to make a promise and and immediately tell you that I don't believe / trust you enough to keep that promise , it's insulting to the person.. why even ask then? If she has seen lots of patriarchy, then don't go the AM route.. Sounds like Femcel. Specially with that Kapil Sharma Show thing. Honestly, above might be wrong. But confirm Legbeard. Nahi, yeh edited nahi hai. Considering the fact that she wants her SO to contribute equally to chores and contribute fully in finances, i don't see how is she bringing a lot to the table?

He dogged a freaking nuclear warhead And these come in bulk, literally truck bhar ke Are you Single? While I agree that the girl’s expectation is a lot, OP I have to tell you this topic is more nuanced than what you think it is. I being a girl, did not like the way you have conducted the ‘investigative chats’ with her. If you had problem with the meaningless comment of hers, you should have confronted her on the call itself. You made her feel like you are ok with it initially and then after she sent you a video you started passively investigating and commenting on something she said a day ago. And telling her hypocritical on a chat?! How much do you know her in 2 days? Couldn’t you just call and tell what you actually think about her. Unfortunately, the kind of girls you are looking for, expect a higher standard of communication style from their prospective partners and you need to improve on it. Sorry if it offends you but I am giving a feedback so that it helps you while you still have time. Some of us don't have luck by our sides in the dating market from a long term relationship perspective and have no other option to but to explore this route as well >Why?

If you are going to respond to my answer with \"the words are meaningless\", then why are you asking? What is the point of the question? At worst, it makes me think that you have trust issues. Why would I want to go ahead with that? Why are you getting so worked up about it brother? Keep your cool. Be calm. Let cooler heads prevail. It's quite evident that if you take it any further you will be facing problems so nip it in the bud and move on.

Why did you reach for \"Andrew Tate\"? There is nothing in any of my comments about him nor am I being misogynistic (at least I don't think so). Is he a personal idol of yours that you had to push him in the conversation somehow? If not, then I would ask you to stop raising unrelated misogynistic people in the conversation.

THE SUPREME COURT.

Agar mirror pe dhul hai to chehre pe dhul hi dikhegi. You find what you are looking for. I am done with the conversation with you and won't respond any more to you. Oohhh! That was a fun one! Although I've always wondered, if suppose there are those few who aren't on social media in general, how would they ever survive in that world? This is not Feminism - She is using the word as cover for validating herself as Trophy Wife. There is a guy Cibil who gives scores based on feminist expectations This woman clearly has issues. There is no reason why you or op should get issues of your own because of her or any other persons issues. There are a lot of bad men and women out there. If we all just gave in to these kind of people all the good ones will die in isolation. Not saying that you should trust people blindly but don’t put on blinders to the good around you. If marriage in India has truly become terrible - don’t get married. That’s completely fair and you have the right to protect yourself. But that doesn’t mean you have to start hating everyone. That’s an extra burden on you that you don’t need. Life is needlessly shit anyway. Cannot entirely blame parents, it depends. What if she is the only child? What if hum 2 humare 2 scheme failed and the son is phycally or mentally challenged? Or the other sibling is a*hole Who will take care of her parents? Majority girls misuse laws, social norms etc to get everything they DREAM/WISH for, while men die working their ass of to get only things they absolutely need. Sad story of poor/middle class family. Communication is useless if other party doesn’t have comprehension capabilities. This girl doesn’t. Problem is that she created this scenario in her head about marriage and she wants you to abide by it. You seem to be a nice man. There are many women hoping to meet someone like you and not all of them are like this. Don’t lose hope. AM setting might seem patriarchal but some found love even there. One thing though- if your gut says something is off, then it is far worse than off. Good thing is we have matrimonial apps, so there is no scarcity of matches. She will understand once she hit 30s and will stop flying and will know there are no takers. And once she is mature then she can marry. Imagine about old times, what if she had married OP with her current mindset ? I doubt that. Most people know their worth. Whoever guy agrees to marry her would do so if he also has some big red flags. I guess you can see it on amazon pay on the website too Ok. Thanks! My dad once told me- Marriage and building a family isn't about dividing responsibilities 50-50. It's a partnership where both individuals give their best, support each other's weaknesses, and practice selfless care to make the marriage thrive. Anything less than this and I'm out. I agree, she texts worse than my grandmother Everybody is learning from Instagram these days Jiske saath bhi shadi kregi ye ladki agle saal tak wapas apne ghar hogi divorce ke baad. (Men counterpart will suffer) I don't know but I have never seen any girl in my college, job struggle in english somehow while have seen enough guys struggle Ye fataka futega nahi, fatega. Nobody is stupid, he would do so if he himself has red flags In same community ? Bakra spotted /s help you to know the how she is managing her finances Probably but why does it have to be the same community? Generally the more different 2 people are genetically the stronger the children turn out to be and they'll be more attractive as adults. Why not bang someone from the other side of the country or even the world? How serious is his condition ? just found out this on amazon pay i have a question is there any security or privacy risk in using amazon or google or cred for free check of cibil? because we are sharing our pan right? My friend had met a girl like her and rejected later. She started all ways of communication to scold my friend, she even sent mail on his office email somehow Parents ? start eloping people, get the job done 😆😆 Why even go with arranged marriage? It is a horrible casteist institution that takes the all the ugliness in social institutions in India and amplifies it to the max. People who go for arranged marriage deserve all the crap they get in it. What is she is buying a lot of stuff but pays all bills on time, but don't have much savings Modern-day Indian women are full of shit and gold-digging cunts. If you don't have the bandwidth, DONT MaRRY. Don't act like a 'oh she hurt me'.Live with yourself and stay happy. End the mental turmoil. Adding a partner to your life should be out of love and care and not under pressure. Each one is entitled to their thoughts and demands. This equality phenomenon suits the males these days. A woman brings in much care and concern into a man's life. Adding to the family lineage. If it doesn't come from your heart or your purse can't manage that. Then better be with yourself. Live calmly. Don't rant. Are your parents going to spend the rest of their lives with the person you marry? Are they going to have the kids and take care of them? You shouldn't be getting married if your parents still have the power to tell you who to marry. I don't understand how can people have long arguments Bhai uski behaviour acceptable hai society me, ye post delete hui milegi dekhiyo delhi vaale subreddit pe jabki vo ladki vale type ki har dusre din aati rehti hai uspe, uspe kya bohot jangah aati rehti hai aisi posts, openly acceptable hai male bashing agar yakeen na mane to mera ye teesra ya pachva account hai we cnt see everything this is just a precautionary measure Well it sounds super trashy. But hey, don't give up.. not everyone is like that. It takes time and patience to find the right one. It's hard and frustrating.. but its worth it! In spite of your bitter experience if you still believe in 'trooo equality ' then I can only pity you. Understand the structural flaws. Empowerment for them is to get access to a better mate. Nothing to do with shouldering responsibilities or putting efforts to destroy Patriarchy. First, arranged marriage by concept is not patriarchal, especially in today's time of online matches. It's the match that makes it patriarchal or otherwise. Also love marriage too is not a guarantee of non patriarchal arrangement. As I said, I don't think it was intended specifically towards OP. She said that such words in general are meaningless. And I can personally vouch for that as well...in my family a close relative got married to a good so-called progressive family but only after a few months of marriage the truth came out. It goes both ways for the bride as well as the groom. It's sometimes difficult to take things at face value in arranged marriages. We remain extra cautious. So if one really needs to make a match, I feel we need to be empathetic as well as communicating. OP here can tell his match that the way she said was hurtful and felt like a personal attack though he also understands the societal dynamics at play. She can also accept that her words may be harsh, and come from a place of pure intentions. First thing, you dodged a bullet. Good for you. Block and move on. Trust me that's the best thing to do here. Second thing, I understand you are dating for marriage but usually avoid writing paragraphs when the girl isn't a text person or lacks skills to articulate in English. This girl is clearly the latter. Call and then subtly nudge the conversation to end up on this matter. Never ever give definitive statements. It puts them on the defensive or worse, they can lie to escape that awkward moment. Always make open-ended statements laced with a bit of ambiguity. Being so straight forward doesn't work with the majority of the fairer sex. Call, preferable face-to-face meetings or video calls. This is how you do the 'difficult' conversations. And no, if she's past 25, you can't change her mind on anything especially if she's financially empowered and comes from a family with good social capital. Remember the societal feedback loop for guys is very efficient and effective. At any point of time, if you can read between the lines, you realise that you have to change for a better match, friends and job. For the gender with the entire structural reforms in their side, it doesn't matter. They got abundant choices. They rarely have to re-learn and un-learn. Regardless of what they might say in those magazines. Why do i get this batshit crazy reddit recomennded as a german? >If you had problem with the meaningless comment of hers, you should have confronted her on the call itself. Like I said, I was thrown off by the words itself so I was not sure what to say. I did respond which she ignored. >You made her feel like you are ok with it initially Really? I spoke up about it and she ignored. That means I am ok with it? Because if you think that way, there a lot of wrong things which would be ok as per your logic. >and then after she sent you a video you started passively investigating and commenting on something she said a day ago. So I can't talk about anything bothering me once 24 hours have passed? >How much do you know her in 2 days? Well, more than 2 days, I mentioned that we talked on the phone a few times. >Unfortunately, the kind of girls you are looking for, expects a higher standard of communication style from their prospective partners and you need to improve on it. And what kind of girls are those that I am looking for? And how does that factor here? >With this passive aggressive communication style you are going to have a hard time. Which part was passive aggressive? Do you even know what it means? Because if you did, then you would have called out the girl sending me the video and then saying that I meant nothing by it as passive aggressive. Thumb rule is Arrange marriage mein ladke ka kat-taa hain .. Aur Love marriage mein ladki ka .( Guy won't lower his standards in love marriage , that's why you hardly see them marrying caste down, financially down,compromising on looks etc.) Haha, pretty sure boy knows this. Shes good on looks, for sure. Otherwise wise men like OP wont be contending AM for this lul minded girl Gpay, Amazon is cool for credit score. But don't even think of accessing your credit score from apps/websites like paisabazar. Once they gain access to your information they'll start spam calling you to sell their credit cards/insurance etc. Sometimes they also make credit card applications on your behalf (without your consent) which results in a hard enquiry on credit score thereby lowering it. She keeps complaining about him to all his relatives (including my mother, his sister). They now live apart, so their children have to shuttle from one place to another. Fortunately, they both live in the same city. He is also at fault a little, but she seems to have a mental health issue. OP, You a G buddy, glad you saw the BS for what it is. AM or not it doesn't matter. This Girl is a text book of Double Standard and the classic case of a Faminist only for their convenience. I am very sure she has BPD cause her POV clearly sounded like she was Gaslighting. DAMN SON DID YOU DODGE A BULLET HERE. You've dodged a bullet my friend. She had shown all the red flags to you before proceeding further. Just imagine the plight of some people who show all these red flags after marriage. Lots and lots of lives are destroyed these days and the laws are absolutely against men too. I’m pretty sure she is completely ignorant of what feminism means Very well put. I don't understand where they get all this entitlement from. You mean they are divorced now ? Of course you guys have trust issues. Do you trust everything that comes out of her mouth? I doubt. I am sure you try to cross check her previous stand one way or another. Trust is earned overtime. It's not the first presumption, especially in today's time. So I would suggest you tell her that her comment was hurtful but don't hold it against her. Also you guys are still strangers who are deciding to live with each other for the rest of your lives. Omg even the thought of it must be scary. You both must be jittery. In such times, use your words and actions and show your true intentions to the other side. Don't be offended if they do not straight away trust what you are saying to be truthful in first go. I think you being on the same boat, can understand the doubts springing. Be open to communicate your views, again and again and again. Consistency in one's outlook towards one thing, make another trust them more. But getting offended the moment some assurance beyond words is asked for, will definitely not lead her to trust you. It actually makes the other side guard up even more. Also, no person is just perfect for another from the very start. Two parties come together, communicate, mold each other and become a perfect fit. I doubt there is any scope left now, but if this lady is a good match otherwise, maybe you can talk to get calm-ly and make her see that her view point is contradictory and you cannot agree to contribute full income while she contributes none. You can discuss your solution to it for e.g. we have a joint account where we both put 60% of our income and rest we both get to keep with ourselves or any other arrangements. If she can see past her mistake and take your view in consideration, that's actually a very good sign. Maybe her own stand is not stiff and she just hasn't thought about financial set up deeply and is hence being childish. Communicate your view point. At night, you simply said ok and left. Which is good since you need time to think. It was her bad timing to have sent that video, but I feel you kind of lashed onto her. I would suggest you give some space for disagreements and faults during your courtship period. Disagreements at this stage are good, they also show that both sides are compatible enough to reach an agreement as well. Also, please understand in the last 26-28 years she has had experiences which have made her the way she is and your experiences have been different resulting in you being the way you are. So use this courtship period to iron out all the disagreements rather than running at the first sign of red flag. Atleast two attempts. And yes, if despite efforts, the red flag does not turn into green, leave. That being said, I can understand your rush to leave this match since a bad match will lead to lifelong consequences but for your next match, if not this, I would suggest sticking around a little longer and trying to reach the stage of agreement. First, pull back men from having a fair shot at jobs and education citing lack of 'equal' opportunities and outcomes. Climb on the backs of men to get a decent shot at material prosperity and then demand that you can't see yourself settling for partners who are not as successful as you if not more. Looks like the 'personal is political' has escaped the discourse. Rubbish all the theories of maternal instincts as Patriarchal conditioning and at an opportune time demand that they must be valued on par with materialistic stuff. Just like regardless of our personal actions, men are considered beneficiaries of Patriarchy, women must also take the responsibilities that come with availing all the structural advantages that come with gynocentric reforms. You're saying \"leaking DMs\" as if this girl is going to be flooded with messages tomorrow morning. No one knows OP. No one knows the girl. Leaking these DMs does absolutely zero harm to anyone involved. What's the issue with sharing screenshots when there is no identifiable information? No one knows OP, nor the girl. There is going to be no random flood of hate messages for the girl. There is zero harm or risk for anyone involved. Well...umm I don't understand how come these girls are meeting nice guys where girls like us only meet players or mentally sick people. I would suggest arranged marriage is a bad idea. Better date someone and marry. Chu ladki. Block her. Have a pint. Chill. She seems extremely immature. Incapable of understanding a normal discussion. She completely ignored all your points and gave answers of something entirely different 😂 And her vocabulary and kapil sharma ?!! 🤡 U got saved !! 🥳 No, not legally anyway. They just live separately. Geniune question. You want to stay as house husband, and don't want to earn money. So in a situation when your wife gets pregnant and has to take care of her body and the child after child birth, she will be on leave and will not get her whole salary but you both have to buy baby supplies, go for hospital checkup etc. which will increase expenses. How will this situation work out? And you will be taking care of her mother and father as well, because you will be living with her in her house after leaving your parents, so how will you cover expenses?? Exactly!!! Why did he went to that level with someone who texts like this 😆😆 I cant agree with you more - a majority of the foolish entitlement women - in the name of equality - want all the good stuff - as in they expect you to take care of all the expenses - no contribution from their side either financially or otherwise- basically they want to work -have disposable income - so that they can enjoy - dont bother about equal chores in the house. Not only that they start thinking about kids after 45 - guess what by then kids are no more a reality since the biological clock is long gone - even if they do have - they take them as blackmailing chips and want separation-so that they have the children and no more need the husband -divorce laws are severely against men and women are milking it to the hilt In the definition of feminism according toe them -what is mine is mine-what is yours is also mine.I suggest you just dodge the bullet else you will be stuck with a lifetime of slavery in the name of feminism \" but it seems that many people think the opposite and expect to get a lot more out of the marriage than what they are bringing to it. \" - sorry your understanding is wrong here - they are not expecting a lot more -they want everything without giving anything in return - thats the main issue here - forget equality -its a one sided brutal massacre women want to enjoy And then there are women who are emotionally blackmailed into parting with their life's savings.... It's not only about texting skills. It is about being able to present an argument lucidly and have a discussion. She was lacking in those. Nuclear weapon dodged. Hope you have better luck! No to judge, but her taciturn replies are so putting off. Imagine such a person in real life! As a female, I feel extremely absurd when I hear some females behaving like this in arrange marriages setups. And feel bad towards men who have wife's like this already in AM way. That is no equality and they are being as absurd as some men have been till recent gen. And I think I gave up wondering what on earth goes in their mind when demanding things like this. Because they have some issues in their mindset and it isn't our job to sit and think about it. Bro that's a ditto conversation I had in my last relationship. It's like seeing deja vu. She clearly stated her expectations (her right) - it's obvious you don't have a provider mindset, so leave it. There are plenty of men who can and want to provide for their women. Why are you still taking on more than 50% of the household work?? I gone through the SSs , Things you are doing wrong: 1- Fixated on minute things (It seems bothering ) 2- Whatever she said on call , you should have listen to it , mention the part you agree with with uttermost support and then move try to explain the your disagreement with a practical example. Unpopular opinion but I think she was scared of upcoming responsibility and work which comes with marriage. My female friends often talk like this somewhat and yet not meant it because they are afraid that agreeing to sharing responsibilities and stuff will get backfired on them. Above is just an opinion, ignore it if don’t like it, no need to argue on something which we don’t know. Mera 795 hai ? Kya meri cutoff clear ho gayi ? Dude that is the only reason that at 34 I am still single and have decided to be for my entire life..I can’t lose my mental peace with such partner..before entering my current hookup lifestyle..I tried to search a permanent relationship but then I realised today no girl is worth that nowadays..I met 15-20 girls for marriage and they all turned to be same hypocrites..gold seekers..they want ATM not life partner..a lot is happening in the name of feminism and girls are playing the victim card..a guy would even marry a girl making less or unemployed one but a girl wouldn’t even marry someone earning equal like her..they want ambanis these days even they themselves stay in 1 room with their family..today after marriage a guy has to suffer not women and laws should be gender neutral now ..just fuck and forget them they don’t deserve your time and energy It's not about texting. He mentioned she talked in a similar fashion, shooting hurtful words. Communication is key, but she lacks compression skills. I'm pretty sure she misunderstood the Instagram reel as well in a way to support her predetermined belief. No meanings that's why Eh, more like neutral flag. They're not here to get married. Just wait for that time. When this kind of attitude will hit her hard. It's All in due time your position is completely understandable and I'd suggest you to put forward a few basic ground rules/principles at the very beginning which you would never compromise on, if that provides you with a deal breaker then it saves you the hassle of long convos Marriages are business deals. Don’t bring emotion in to a business deal. Married man here with kids. OP you’re a bit immature. The truth is when you will have a kid, your wife would most likely take care of the kid in addition to a lot of household work she will silently do. Before you demand financial equality from women, tell me how many men are willing to do household chores like women? This includes minimum things like feeding the baby, taking care if baby, cooking food for baby, taking care of in laws etc. Indian society is not designed in a way that men and women earn equal and share households responsibilities. Men should really contribute in household chores before demanding financial contributions from their wife. She watches Kapil Sharma dude, that's a red flag in itself. she needs grammar lessons 🗿 I totally get that people may balk at how much load I’m taking right now. My husband has a demanding academic year and my work is more flexible. And this arrangement is only till he finishes his degree. Like I said, we’re a team and we work accordingly as the situation evolves. Just end it. Look for people that are nice and polite in first anything.give them three chances atmost, more if you think that they can change. But dont make your goal to change them. how would downloading an app be less secure than the website? >First, arranged marriage by concept is not patriarchal, especially in today's time of online matches. It's the match that makes it patriarchal or otherwise. Also love marriage too is not a guarantee of non patriarchal arrangement Doesn't really make sense.. if you were in a love marriage , aka a relationship for a long time before marrying ,you would atleast know what kind of a person your SO is atleast better than random dudes from matrimonial. >As I said, I don't think it was intended specifically towards OP. She told it to OP. If it was intended to OP or men in general, it's just an insulting statement to make.. If a man asks you \"will you cheat on me?\" And girl says \"never\" and the guy says \"all of you girls say that\", you would call the man an asshole right ? Similarly this woman is a devastating red flag.. she made her point pretty clear. And that combines with her other comments is enough red flags.. >So if one really needs to make a match,feel we need to be empathetic as well as communicating. It's always expected from the man to be empathetic and communicating.. as I said , if a man had said this to a girl, he would be labelled as a Grade A asshole , as he should .. people who insult others are assholes.. as is this woman Bro dont get feminism into this.. True feminists understand that both male n female are equal victims of patriarchy.. Don't spoil a movement like this Think of yourself as a lucky person that you got to know this before marrying her. >her cibil score What if papa is paying bills???? Xd Social media , Instagram and other social media apps fuel this . Influencers put pic on Instagram and women expect same from other men Move on , itna complex nahi karne ka as u r just conversing , if u feel basic understanding nahi hai initially itself then dont stretch trying to adjust. Red flags jase kuch nahi hota , a personal can be good initially and make ur life miserable post marriage as well , Just remember both should be able to bend , keeping aside your egos thats marriage. Baki teri kismat.wish u good luck Goddamn usernames checks out! brokering the best deal, regardless of gender > You didn’t say every girl but in your mind if it was just a few, you wouldn’t have made this post. It's amazing how you have the capability to read my mind but still ask me to explain here. >People don’t use phrases like ‘sorry state of affairs’ when addressing about a small population. Why not? You have no idea if I am talking about within my religion or my community and what is the size of the matrimony pool so how are you are estimating these things? And what decides when I can say \"sorry state of affairs\"? Is there a size after which I can say? >And coming to your unrealistic expectations part, if people are agreeing to it then how is it unrealistic? That’s called knowing your worth. Tomatoes were selling for Rs.250 some months back and now they are back down to 20-25. People bought it but 250 was unrealistic and not their real worth. >Something us guys don’t understand. I don't care what your gender is. >Lmao you are accusing me of using anecdotal evidence while conveniently skipping over ‘I don’t get to extrapolate’, thus completely changing the meaning what I said. The same way you skipped the \"marrying above\" part and the \"attributing lines I did not say to me\" part? Adding lines rejecting the anecdote make no difference if you are going to mention the anecdote. You know what would have helped your point when you said \"And no, anecdotal evidence doesn’t work \"? Not sharing any anecdote. >We can’t even what all things you missed in your original story And then he is going around commenting why post the screenshots. This is exactly why. >shows your emotional maturity and ‘morals’ that you are swinging around. Says the guy suggesting ways to create fake screenshots. RUN SIR RUN.........RUN LIKE MR. FORREST GUMP. You're lucky. You spoke before marriage. How many men would genuinely want to marry women with higher income than them? It's not about objectification... Communication and comprehension are also essential in a relationship And honestly she seems a bit lacking Maybe she's more comfortable in her mother tongue But there is a clarity of thought that is noticeable... Regardless of the language Sorry to break it to you but she doesn't seem to have that Thank you so so much!!! 498, not yet, but threats are being made since last 3 months without any provocation from my side. Its like living under constant pressure. Just in case : AI chatbots these days provide better replies than her lmfao Thank you! Gosh the amount of times I've seen women misusing feminism is so baffling !! How conveniently she picked up a criteria that both genders should be equal in taking responsibility But took a u-turn & went back to age old patriarchal roots that only guys are supposed to bear financial responsibilities She's a self centred hypocrite, you deserve better OP Maybe find someone on your own, someone whose personality & wants & expectations match with you. It's 2023, you can't get married to an absolute stranger, who can bring uncalled turbulences in your life.. Good luck 💛 I am a woman,and even I could tell you literally dodged a bullet train which was aiming wreck you out🤣 I don't know anything about you to tell you why those are the male role models available to you. But that is not the case with me. At least not the people I am acquainted with. We have grown up helping our mothers and sisters, sharing household responsibilities. So while what you are saying may be true for a certain generation, I do not think that accurately applies. Thanks for your opinion though. Very well said, ideally it should be 50:50 with the ratio always shifting. Impossible to find that balance and that is life :) Both should be willing to understand and accept the value of this imbalance. Rise up. Break the cycle. If you don't pay attention to the permissions you provide to the app, usually the app will collect more data than it should. Which means that your profile somewhere in some database is being updated with more details, to data about you, already stolen and resold, from other sources. With a website the default permissions are not as open as with an installed app and you will be asked for permissions every time. Most importantly, I don't use a mobile phone for financial websites either. Because my cheap Mi phone could have some app somewhere reading keystrokes etc. I use a desktop / laptop that I know is secured. I don't travel much, and that helps. So did you get picked yet? > Sometimes they also make credit card applications **on your behalf (without your consent)** which results in a hard enquiry on credit score thereby lowering it. This should be criminal. I think it is criminal under impersonation or something like that in IPC. There might be better targetted laws in the IT Act and in specific financial laws. Yes here she don't want to understand. That girl is not educated at your level. I've been convincing my mum for a few years to find someone to marry since last few years. She's finally open to it now, not actively searching though. She's 55 by the way. You guys are delusional thinking there is an age to get married. Yes. 20 years ago. > Plus OP seems to be attacking her when she is clearly not arguing. How's that surprising when you invest some of your time in a person and then the same person tells you \"your words are meaningless\"? This isn’t really an arranged marriage only thing; woman’s earnings are for themselves (she may spent on her children) but a man’s earnings are for the whole family. This has been going on since the dawn of human kind but smart men know this and make this work to their advantage. I do believe that marriage in India is largely unfair to women and they have every reason to be skeptical about it. However, that doesn't justify her terming OP's words as \"meaningless\". That's basically a code for \"I don't care what you say\". Getting into a significant legal arrangement with such people can have disastrous ramifications. Wouldn't be surprised if the common advice is to avoid such people. That is a great advice. But how does one figure that out before getting married, especially in an arranged marriage setup? Leaving it to fate is just to big of a legal risk. Bad news, find someone else this one is loco ! That girl is scared because she’s going to be burdened with household work and also professional work. It’s hard for women to handle both. Only when the partner steps in and offers equal support it’s possible to manage things. So before entering into marriage, a woman expecting this should be a norm. I hope this is what she wanted to convey. The off putting thing here is even when the OP agrees he will contribute she keeps throwing him off. I’m still giving her the benefit of the doubt here because there are people who do that just to get past the discussion. Here she could have accepted what OP said and could have pointed out she will be satisfied when she sees it in action. She could have assured him saying she’s taking a leap of faith and hopes he will keep his word like a true gentleman. Now to the red flag, the financial thing expectations from the girl is absurd. I have no rational to explain or reasoning to her logic. She expects equal partnership(in every aspect) but is not ready to contribute financially? It’s definitely not OP‘s job to make her understand that’s something irrational. I am just gutted that she calls herself feminist and doesn’t understand a dime about it. >Also, get over this whole past the marriage age thing. Yes, there is a biological clock for women in terms of having a kid and all but there’s enough options through science these days to get around that Fair enough. I did not mean it in an offensive way. I rescind that part of the statement. You should've told her In the wise words of Detective Abhijeet \"Ek gaand pe raapta maara na, sadak pe hagti phiregi\" (edited to suit your case OP) >This has been going on since the dawn of human kind So has been domestic violence. Does not make it okay. Pseudo feminism and it's consequences. This is so common from girls these days that I’m surprised when they DONT state this. Boys are taught gender parity, but we’re the girls attending the same lesson? It seems like the lesson they pick up is gender parity when it benefits me and non parity when it benefits me. I love your entire outlook. Many of these resonate with my own thoughts but sadly yet to find someone who thinks in that manner. I feel so sorry for the girl. She knows that she is saying the wrong things, she is too lazy to commit and so lazy to even argue with you properly and she does not have the guts to frankly tell you her unreasonable demands, so she has to hide behind a radical side of an otherwise genuine ideology which is nowhere near her intellectual quotient. Her grammar is shit too. Bro you saved yourself from life time trauma! Let me clarify , she isn’t a feminist . She is the opposite of feminist . She is expecting you to maintain her lifestyle while she wants you to support her in every possible way as she believed in “equality in everything “ Good riddance dude! My SIL has said the same things, after love marriage. My brother was naive to think she is young and childish and will mature with age. But nope after many years of marriage, kid and now even at 30, she has the same mentality. Same words she has used. Buy me car, buy me everything, don’t expect me to pay for anything. Has no credit score, no stable job and no responsibilities of house. Even when she was SAHM, she has househelp for everything but Doesn’t believe in breakfast, like that’s something to believe in. Feeds toddle biscuit and milk in morning. Cooking lunch at 12 is a big ask. Doesn’t do grocery shopping or know how much is paid for monthly cooking gas. Even after asking for help by husband they won’t give any support- financially, mentally or socially. Such women exist, get married and have kids. Even after going to divorce multiple times they will manipulate and get their way. I have some friends who are genuinely hard working and want to be equals in all manner but they don’t find guys. Because they are not manipulative or cunning as these girls. I am happily married btw, I earn more than my husband and we do everything equally (if that info matters). Hate to see other girls take advantage of guys and their families under the pretence of feminism. what about 767-797? Sir, she is a great more rational than most women. Atleast she had the rationality to know that she expected to be taken care of financially. Most time women wouldn't say this upfront. But subconsciously they expect this. Probably marrying her would be a good choice. Your next match won't show these red flags. But believe me, the flag is hidden. No amount of rational thought is going to penetrate this subconsciously held expectations that's hides to pounce on you after marriage. Btw on a different note, I have to complement your writing skills. Loved reading this post!! I meant \"trust issues\" in a larger sense not me in particular but I assure you that the expectation is not that she starts to trust me from the first word out of my mouth. As you have said, deciding for marriage is a time of great change and I agree that it is scary, and we both have lived different lives and had different experiences so obviously our outlooks and approach to life are different. Which is why I decided to give her the benefit of doubt initially but then she gave her other thoughts which is when I decided to stop. As Maya Angelou said, “When people show you who they are, believe them the first time” I definitely appreciate your thoughts and love your communication style too. It is very patient and thorough. itna desperate rahogi tho seeda rejected 😭😭 lol haha Yes this! Me and husband say it’s 100-100, no half ass job. Both put in 100% Isn't arranged marriage about the families finding spouses? I thought the things you mention are supposed to be worked out by the group. What is the difference between what you're doing and regular online dating? Join a website, find a prospect, talk and see if you're interested. Yes, she is bonkers. But if you like her otherwise would having your parents talk to hers be any help? Couldn't her parents tell her what is reasonable? Yep. More like a gold digger or arm candy than any sort of feminist. She thinks feminism means \"everyone does what I say\", LOL Bro dodged the meteorite that the dinosaurs couldn’t application ke link ? Thanks. It came from a place of frustration though. My cousin was asked by her AM candidate's mother, \"You sure you can take care of our son when you're pregnant? We can't always be around to look after him after all, we need a strong woman!\" and that's when I realized that I will never ever set foot into this goofy ass field of worse-pitch-evers. Sadly, we are at a time where some women follow a very warped version of feminism where everything benefits the women and they get all the benefits but none of the responsibilities. Send her this post link before you end things. Hopefully she'll understand how terrible is her texting. The above has nothing to do with arranged marriage. You could go on a date and have the same conversation. There are plenty of girls like this in general. There was a viral video just this week where the girl was refusing to get down on a date cos she didnt like the restaurant. Arranged marriage would be when you didn't know all this and married forcefully and then realize this is what the personis like. The fuck are you saying? Gender equality left the chat , so should you.. Both are equally bad Bullet?? Missle? Fuck no!!’ More like a Nuclear bomb lol Yes yes and yes! These problems arises because of these 50:50, 60:40 etc. It has to be 100:100 and nothing less than that. More like an ICBM. I remember this happening to me. She wanted someone who was making $125k. She didn't work. Wasn't planning on working, cooking, or any other chores. I simply asked her what you bring to the marriage that is worth $150k? She got offended. These are the double standards from so called 'Feminists\" you'll see them everywhere Bhai red flags toh sab baad ki baat hai, yeh type kaise karti hai? Flags jhel lo but not this “*Even if she not works doesn't mean that she doesn't doing anything she handles your home and kids*” RIP English! Does these self proclaimed armchair feminists in India even know the meaning of the word ? Or are they just aping the West mindlessly. At least Western feminists put their money where their mouth is and actually come out and protest any infringement of their rights and are ready to debate their ideas intelligently. Every unemployed man will accept a woman who earns lol Let’s do How much you make? Let’s get hitched and you handle the expenses, I’ll handle the home Just don’t be ugly, I can’t handle that shit Lol she has no savings? Bruh I ain’t marrying some brokie with no savings When men will start having periods and get pregnant we will talk gender equality. Till then, shut the f\\*ck up. Came here to say this, glad others also relate lol So you are saying that she should spend all the savings on just child birth. Savings are for emergency like an unexpected disease or old age times, or maybe your child's upbringing. You expect her to have a maid and driver for your comfort and then except her to spend all her savings, go through the pain of her pregnancy and childbirth that has been proven to be equally painful of 10 bone fracture And you will do nothing to contribute while feeding off her money even for your child. Well, with that mindset, just stay single and happy. Lol can you please share the data about childbirth being proven to be as painful as 10 bone fractures? Also I broke my hand while on trek in the Pyrenees a few years ago and had to walk down to a clinic with a broken hand, the walk was at least 6-7 kms….wasn’t really that painful tbf so I think I could handle 10 fractures pretty easily Coming to the point, are you attractive and do you make bank? Because don’t worry about your savings Hun, I got plenty There is a site called You can check the data on there or simply search on google, you can find it. I wasn't talking about necessarily about pain, I was asking about how would you cover expenses at that time. Simply answer the question or if don't have an answer ignore the question, don't drift the topic. Lol you said “proven to be as painful as 10 fractures” and then you ask me to click some shady link or google search Typical Anyway to answer your question, I got enough of my own money bruh, I don’t even need my woman to earn but if she insists she can lol but one parent has to be devoted to the kids and I wouldn’t mind being that parent Ain’t no way my kid gets raised by some fucking au pair or daycare OP just discovered what a \"Shit Test\" is (and failed), lol just wait until you see shit tests of a love marriage. She's a 100% right that every guy out there is saying the same thing as you are, because words are cheap for boys. So how does she differentiate between true words and false words? This is why she gave you a shit test. You asked to give me data, how am I supposed to give it to you not by a link or by Google. Is there some other way? I was talking about the situation you mentioned, you not earning and being married to an working women. Then how will cover expenses? If you don't need your woman to earn then what's the point of writing a message about you wanting to marry a high earning woman? I thought you really were a person ready to be a househusband so I asked you a geniune question but you are not even considering that situation in your reply. As we say in my town, “sugar, I’ve read your beads and seen more than enough”. Glad you figured it out. Dispose of properly and move on to someone who’s not a crazy bi-yitch. By linking me to the actual study And I do want to be a house husband, if you are attractive and make good money then dm me a picture of yourself and bank statements I’m not wasting time discussing all this with some ugly brokie bro, got better things to do Oh, ok then. I understand that you don't have an answer to my question. Do your better things then. And I just asked a normal question, that doesn't mean I want to have a relationship with you. Stop mentioning it. What is the movement doing to rein in such women? I literally mentioned in my original comment to dm me if my terms were acceptable Why the fuck would I waste my time answering questions from some random ugly brokie? What is in it for me? No true scotsman fallacy Say something negative about women and get downvoted. At least you agree that it's entitled behavior on the woman's part. That's a start. And that is why I didn't dm you but asked you in a reply because your terms weren't acceptable to me. You replied to everyone's questions before so I thought you would reply to me as well. If you don't want to reply just read the message and don't reply but you keep replying. Again sir, go do your better things and don't waste your precious time talking to an ugly brookie like me. I must have wasted a lot of your precious time of an attractive richest man of world. I am extremely sorry. Arranged marriage is nothing but a financial transaction. And this girl is really annoying. I'm a feminist too and I can tell you that she isn't a feminist. She's a gold digging (b)itch. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Me and my husband both work. But he earns more than me and thus, contributes more financially. I contribute what I can but I take care of pretty much most of the household chores so when he comes home he can relax. And he regularly offers to help me with household chores as well. A loving marriage is all about supporting each other in any possibile way you can. People like her are selfish and unreliable. Better to just flip them the bird and move on. I'm sure you'll find the right girl soon. RIP to the man who falls for this (b)itch in the future because I'm sure there's some desperate (p)ussy less simp out there who would overlook all her red flags. Smh! I'm happy that you realise your worth and know you deserve better. I agree wholeheartedly. I'm so tired of pieces of (s)hit like this woman who give feminism such a horrible rep. It's so frustrating. Lol yes! She just seems so disinterested to talk. All she cares about is money. I wish I could dump her in a trashcan Not reading all that sorry, have a good day Absolutely dodged one. Problem is these pseudo feminist types, they want to eat their cake and have it too. They think feminism is all about having the power to do what you want, but they always forget uncle Ben when he said 'with great power comes great responsibility.' They just want the freedom that comes with the power, but no responsibility. But don't worry, there are some good ones out there too, keep kissing the frogs and perhaps, maybe you'll find your princess. Thank you Just end it and go ahead with the search process. You have your radar for red flags working fine. Don’t let the thought of “back to the grind of filtering profiles, chatting up, meeting up etc” goad you into ignoring those red flags or make you doubt yourself. As long as you have time and patience on your side, being a guy you don’t have to worry. For women the clock is ticking. Starting these mental gymnastics even before being engaged is a huge red flag. PS: I went thought the AM route and successfully managed (or I don’t know lucked out) to find one I consider a good if not the best possible match. Things is we both knew what we want / didn’t want from the other, and sort of clicked. This doesn’t mean we have our usual set of struggles in day to day lives. Just that every time something goes wrong between us, I think back to all the jokers I met / came across in the AM process(one wanted to know how much fixed assets I have in my name, another would only talk about travelling as hobby, etc). And it cools me down. Bhai mein ek saal se yehi biryani kha raha hu. Each girl wants to be equal, wants to work, but wants the husband to be responsible for everything. So she takes care of the children, children that aren’t even born yet. No thanks! Goodluck with the hunt bro, we’re all in it together. if you are trying to find your equal then expectation woudl be high, try finding someone who is not your equal Well, it's exactly women like this who end up with dicks in an arranged marriage, they marry for money & then get treated like shit all life, lol 😆 Don’t get married, it’s fucking exhausting. Live your life the way you want to. Spend time with your parents. Marriage is so not it. Just curious, how much of the house work did you offer to do? I want everything to be equal, I am bit of a feminist . I want my husband to support our lifestyles , I won't be contributing anything financial. Where did the feminism go , can anyone find it . Maybe also find a dictionary for this woman. Pseudo feminist. Wdym I agree with you and Maya Angelou both. Thank you!! All the best on your search for a partner! :') Then wipe all the feminists from the face of earth who are fighting for equality and yourself as well. Right so what if you just don't provide permissions to the app? How are you sure that your computer doesn't have a keylogger on it? Thinking about some poor, clueless dude who's gonna end up with that thing. are u a moron or just pretending to be stupid? dating is also not good these days… Online dating main bhi to yahi hota hai yaar In hindsight, What red flags did you oversee? Nowadays there are fake feminist on YouTube and Instagram reels which inspire half brained girls on stupid things. A real man goes the extra mile in any situation without even being asked women who come with conditions are a total red flag. Your husband is a lucky guy :) Not helping, doing equal household work like women. There is a huge difference. When you seek equal financial responsibility from women be ready to pull your weight in household work, treat her parents like your parents( as you would expect from her), feed the kid in middle of night. Its all easier said then done. Being a woman is hard in India and it will never improve as kids like you look into equality angle as it suits you. Next time when you ask for equal financial responsibility from women you want to marry just self reflect what all you bring to the table. This is coming from a man whose wife is also working a stressful job, does more household work than him and is the default care taker of our child. She is a super woman and i have asked her if i should take a less stressful job to make more time for our kid or if she wants to do that to have some free time for her. Well done OP for walking away. This post also highlights how misunderstood the concept of 'feminism' is. Influenza reels and dumb tv shows don't help the cause either. Yes dude's magical with words. I loved how he wrote the entire post and the screenshots too while being straight forward and calm. I already know such a person. Don’t marry her. She will only make your life hell. She is immature. The video she sent is the biggest red flag. She is not a feminist, she is a pseudo feminist. This marriage will only work if you completely submit to her whims and desires. Anything other than that will lead to regular fights. Take care bro. Long ago a girl once told me Mr xyz itni achi dikhne wali ladki ki demand bhi bohot zyada hoti hai well as per your comment you gave a hell lot of importance to her rights and forgot all of his rights(OP’s) …. then come back at me saying when men will have periods then we should talk equality which will never happen so we should always shut up and never think about our rights….. clearly states who is the stupid here, so that sums up everything i need to say here, i wont reply to you now. Thats my limit of having a discussion with a moron. Thanks!!! May be she could save for both of you. You could have clarified more. Some girls like to save . I earn more than my husband , it was not the case first. Still He takes the responsibilities for life in general. Recently we bought a house where I gave 40 % full down payment from my side and property will be registered on both of us. There is no mine or yours in marriage. But this feeling will come only when people get attached with each other and girl will feel save with her man. Money is security for her that she saw her mother’s got deprived of . Today’s men should understand the mindset as well. She will pay for maids and will give birth to your children. She will do lots. Please don’t marry if you have issues for paying for your partner in India. We girls have started working but we saw our mothers doing double work in their life. Girl wants love , respect and understanding from their partners. Feminist brag about how being a housewife is such a herculean task they should get paid, because a maid would not do the same amount of work. Alright then, how about as a housewife you get paid, but you also pay rent for staying in the husband's house. At this point you realise feminists are just immature idiotss who just don't qualify as good candidates for any kind of relationship Getting divorced soon For girls its like.. Your salary is our salary My salary is stree dhan. 1. Why is it hard to question her and have logical conversation? Both men and women say stupid things all the time. Every marriage has either couple being dumb at some point of time. Why not ask her where this idea of equality is stemming from, how he deduced it, and see if it's possible to have a logical conversation with the other probable future partner. Ask her questions like, if I lose my job, does this mean that u won't support me or be as equal as me, etc etc 2. Everything is a phase. U cannot enter the arranged marriage idea with all green flags and 100% logic. 3. There are many households where women have taken the effort of earning the larger income and looking after the household work and everything for their kids future. Check if she is expecting the man to earn more as generally as a woman, in whatever she does, if she's earning less. There is a whole 9 month maternity + 6 months of care and other things that most people don't take an account of. Many women look for a higher earning partner so that she can concentrate on the whole child thing and not worry about when she has to go back to work to afford something she wants for the child. Like there are many insecurities that pop up when we hear our own mother's struggles as a working mother who handled finances and household work and kids education and all that. The whole idea of a Superwoman is a thankless expectation. 4. If the girl is moving into your house, what she means may be that she wants to keep her money, handle her money, etc than give all of it to you...I have not seen a woman not give the husband money from her savings for bigger investments like house or emergencies or whenever he couldn't pay for it......check the deeper meanings inside these conversations or questions or 'expectations' if you are really looking for a partner. 5. Every word has different meanings. Check if both of u have the same meaning for the word expectation before u assume that it is. 6. With your level of patience, don't look for an arranged marriage. Do dating apps as its easier to swipe, ghost, say no there and there's no obligation to have a deeper conversation unless the other person is looking for the same. arranged marriage and marriage systems are failing miserably due to expectations are is always high for both parties. its better not to get married at all rather than go through this jeevansathi idiot she is looking for provider type guy, if u not one, step away and let one step in. what FEMINISTS have to do with it? Good thing you schooled her OP. And tried to have a mature discussion. You’ll find the one! All the best What do men want in marriage ? You have got to be trolling at this point Women who are am aren't good ?? Marriage has become more than two people coming together and sharing a bonding and companionship after these smartphones have gone into the wrong hands. These women think that they are the ones who are operating those brainwashing apps that teach them what feminity is. Wrong. The app is the one operating them and churning their minds. And speaking of dowry and girl side spending money on the marriage, I'm absolutely with it. Koi dikkat nhi hai. Mai lunga dahej, puri shiddat se. Aukat nhi hai, to mat karo shadi. Tumhe lifestyle aur financially stable ladka chahiye, to equality whaa bhi hogi. Bejhijak. I don't see real feminism effective anywhere, no one is making social media posts, no one fighting unrealistic body images etc etc Rab ne banadi jodi Bro, I've been experiencing the same since about 8 months, AM is ridiculous. There was a time when the society used to say that the males should be kept in control, males should be educated, males are evil and blah blah blah. Now's the time when it's exactly opposite situation. In Marathi there's this statement पोरगी शिकली, प्रगती झाली, but is that so? I just find this so hilarious as per the current situations. Look I will tell you what happened here. She actually wants a traditional marriage. But supports gender equality in a way that, she has the right to do what she wants, without being discriminated. Quite complicated, but that’s what I am guessing her mindset is like. Because, it’s only in traditional marriages that you will see this setting right? That the husband earns and the wife does not owe to support the household. And also for feminism, because feminism supports right to traditional as well as career woman, she must be thinking it in that way. That’s what my guess is. You on the other side, want an egalitarian marriage, which is ok. And to be honest, it will seem unfair if she earns a lot but does not contribute to the household, why? Because you will do more of the work but for nothing to gain. It’s not a pleasant place to be. So yes, you did good by leaving her. She needs those traditional guys who are all over youtube shorts. This is just my perspective on what happened. Your husband will be very lucky How is it not deviding responsibility 50:50 This is also a red flag tbh Even I met a girl who was blaming patriarchy at every chance she gets, randomly blaming in any general conversation , then even supported Amber heard in Johnny Depp case out of the blue. I was like I’m out and ran away. Now there is one more girl her family is way more interested than the girl, brother confirmed that she doesn’t have any ex bfs . The girl never responds properly hardly texts for 2mins a day and then vanishes. Even doesn’t have time for phone calls. Repeatedly keeps Cancelling plans to meet physically (she has to travel 5hours to meet me). She says she wants to talk more and see before saying Yes, but is not putting in the time. I’m not sure if she wants to take things forward or not. It’s so frustrating. I don’t know if I should start talking to other women or not it’s been 2months already. If She earns, she earns for herself 💅 If you earn, you earn for her too 🫡🤡 Crap, so no one is happy being married. Very sorry to hear that and hoping things go well for you. I can't generalize it for all men. Some want beauty. Some want money. Some are in for high status. Some want all of above. Some just carve for a companionship. And then there are POS who just want a \"legal house maid\" to have sex with. Awesome post ! Bro...Don't give her benefit of doubt. Kick her out of your life. I can write a long explanation but please kick her out, its a genuine request She mentions taking care of home & kids. If that involves home chores- cooking and cleaning, her expectations are justified. But again you could say those words are meaningless coming from girls :)) Arranged marriages only work well when done in the traditional way. I mean the success rate is higher compared to finding your partner online I'm just a messenger. Thanks. And yes, marriage is a big scam with some exceptions. That’s actually the best case scenario- can you imagine the complaining and insults if she makes more than and his spending on both of them can’t keep up with what she spend on herself? A partner who doesn't help you in finances is just a burden. >Not helping, doing equal household work like women. You know nothing about me to make an assumption about this. >When you seek equal financial responsibility from women be ready to pull your weight in household work, treat her parents like your parents( as you would expect from her), feed the kid in middle of night. Its all easier said then done. Did I not already offer that? Again, what are you basing these assumptions on? >Being a woman is hard in India and it will never improve as kids like you look into equality angle as it suits you. Please point out where I'm looking into the \"equality angle as it suits me\" >Next time when you ask for equal financial responsibility from women you want to marry just self reflect what all you bring to the table. All the financial responsibility, apparently. >This is coming from a man whose wife is also working a stressful job, does more household work than him and is the default care taker of our child. Then it seems like you need to step up than simply asking if you should give up your job. I can understand that people project their personal things but... This should be top comment I particularly like your answer because you are doing everything to defend her and blame me without outright saying it. 1. I did ask her. She said, no point in discussing at this point. 2. Show me one green flag in that conversation. Please. 3. I have said nowhere that I expect her to be a superwoman and manage everything. In fact, the expectation is the other way round if you take the time to read the screenshots. 4. Ya...no. Her \"I don't think so\" was all the deeper meaning that is required. 5. I would if she could type properly. (I'm just being cheeky, apologies) 6. It seems you did not read my post and just came barging in. I talked to her multiple times on call and that was the vibe she had given me then too (it is in my last comment to her). A week's worth is patience is more than adequate since would say. Move on, man. Actions speak louder than words. Honestly... I don't want egalitarian. I will willingly and lovingly go above and beyond for the person I love. I'm not thinking what I'm gaining. It's the sense of entitlement that she was having. Her words and actions showed that she has biases and prejudices and was not having a partner mindset. For her, it seems, marriage was just a way to have a lifestyle that she could not herself afford. I think social media has a hand in that since the link she shared was from Instragram. True, but the only problem is if I stop texting then she comes back and talk for say 2mins and again when she gets a response she is no longer replying for the whole day and next day too. Not sure what she is trying to do . Just confusing the heck out of me. So I’ll also keep the same level of response she has. Then finally nobody is talking. I’ll start my search for someone else. I read somewhere that if a girl likes you, you will know. If she does not, you will be confused. What do you think? Seems relatable to me, but in my case she did mention that she likes to be chased. Not sure if that’s healthy. Also I have tried chasing her but when you don’t get a response there is no meaning of chase. Yes, please run far away from this person. At least she fully revealed herself early, and you saw her for what she was to your credit. Brothers, if marrying in the US, please get an iron clad prenup, I am not kidding, really think about this, and overcome the embarrassment of asking for one. Consider yourself lucky for seeing the red flags early. You didn’t waste your time unlike many people who chose to ignore them. Good luck on finding the right one. Option 2 seems like a pretty random thing. So the man's income goes to the woman? But the woman's income is also hers and hers alone? Only way i could see this making even a little sense is that if there surplus of the man's income is at least equal to what the woman is making Bro you didn't dodge a bullet,a grenade or rocket. You Dodge a Freaking Intercontinental Ballistic Missile!! 🚀 Consider this as a Feat of Strength. \"May be she could save for both of you\" is a far cry from \"I do not expect to be asked to contribute financially to the marriage in any way\". Not contribute financially, but not expected to be asked to contribute. Can you even imagine that audacity? I do understand your thought process though, I just don't think it applies here. Yeah... That was the conclusion I drew too... Yup... That's what I thought too I have nothing more to offer. I mean everything is right there, if you want to turn a blind eye then can't help it. Yeah... Someone's I get thoughts that it is so exhausting right now, what about after when you are actually responsible for a person... Exactly what I said in an another comment Yup, man. Sounds like you got a good deal. Off your partner is understanding then it will be smooth. Lol... You want to seriously search for a partner or play stupid games? Because only one of them will get you a partner. lol Fair enough. Glad you dodged your bullet too. She was managing her own profile so talked directly. If it had been her parents, they would have been diverted to mine. Strictly stay single than getting married to anyone like her. And what's your message Sir, it is not about financial expectations. Is is the underlying entitlement that my partner should provide everything while I bring the bare minimum (or not even that) to the table. It is the victim complex she is exhibiting from the outset. It is the unambiguous Only thing I'd like to say is, she doesn't understand what feminism means. She's just learnt some buzzwords and is just throwing them around without really understanding their meaning. She seems to have a patriarchal mindset of husbands financially supporting wives, but wants to appear woke too, and doesn't understand that wives who work should also support their husbands financially. This shows an incomplete understanding of feminism and gender equality. Drop her like a hot potato, if you think her thought process is not likely to change. Bro got a papa ki pari as his match. Bro, move on. It won't be good for your health if you let this idiot girl's rambling get into your head. >Paranoid about security Hope you don't have any Google Products in your phone, even reddit, Facebook, Instagram etc. You are not protecting your identity if you use or don't use Finance apps but still use Google Products especially phone apps. No one fighting unrealistic body images for women, seriously? The girl has heard some words which she finds cool and wants to use them in her conversation to sound intelligent and liberal. You should protect your peace and move on. The way she gaslighted you saying the thing has \"no meaning at this stage\" is another red flag. She herself bombarded her opinions on you but when you expressed your point she withdrew from the discussion. This is just women being real, no masks. It’s not so easy for girls either. These days all guys want is a girl who’s an only child with the rich father so that the entire inheritance comes to the guy later. Moreover, guys cheat rampantly these days. A woman’s career suffers due to pregnancy. What if after having 2 kids the guy dumps her for a younger model. If she’s contributing financially since day 1, she’ll have no savings to support kids later. Guys don’t pay alimony these days either. They drag court proceedings for 10+ years so that the girl gives up and divorces him for her freedom (all this while the guy would be living with his gf, since it’s legally allowed in India) I support the girl. Men are pigs. With this attitude please dont get married, if you can argue with random people on internet, i can imagine what you will do with your wife. If y'all are managing your own matrimony accounts then you're not AMing, you're dating. This is a dating rant and a dating reality. LOOOOOOOLLLLLL you're a joke bro. Stay single please and don't inflict yourself on any woman. Thanks. Ayo bro, you're the one at fault here. If you were intelligent enough, you wouldn't have given any \"benefit of doubt\" at all! Please use punctuation marks it is barely readable Lol. You are the one being rude and blaming me for things that have no basis. I just asked you to clarify. That is not an argument. I agree that the last part of my previous comment was a bit rude but I think it was fair based on your whole general response. >Moreover, guys cheat rampantly these days Question: Who are the guys cheating with? Other guys? If not, then isn't the blame on both parties? > If she’s contributing financially since day 1, she’ll have no savings to support kids later. Did anyone say give her whole salary? The point is not the contribution but the entitlement that her lifestyle should be provided for by the husband while not even doing the bare minimum. Be honest, reading her chat, do you feel that is a fair expectation from her given her 'victim complex' and 'woe is me' attitude? >Guys don’t pay alimony these days either. If it's a court order, nothing he can do to avoid it. There are many legal avenues to get that. >They drag court proceedings for 10+ years so that the girl gives up and divorces him for her freedom And the girl does not do that? Have you never heard of a false dowry case filed on the guy and his parents? >(all this while the guy would be living with his gf, since it’s legally allowed in India) Is it illegal in India for the girl to be living with her bf? > I support the girl. Men are pigs. And there you have it... This conversation is over now. You know this how? > I was thinking about the conversation and thought that maybe I should give her the benefit of doubt. May be she did not mean the words in the manner she said it and may have had trouble putting her thoughts forward in a proper way My man, if a girl is into you, she wouldn't make mistakes like that. She would choose her words so that there is no doubt in them. It is clear that she's not into you. Also, you seem like the kinda person who'd not give the kinda leeway you just gave this girl to another guy. It's time you start treating girls the same way you treat men and not like some spoilt brat. Guys cheat with other women by lying to them and saying they’re single / divorced. So yes, blame can’t be on both parties. She will be giving birth to the kids and her career will suffer a setback because of it. The living expenses like food/ housing should come from the husband. There will be no court order since the guy won’t sign the divorce papers till the alimony amount is 0. A guy will be living with his gf while still being married to the wife telling the Gf that he’s single. It’s legal in India to be living in with another woman while being married to somebody else. The emotional turmoil caused to the woman is unimaginable because in all likelihood the woman doesn’t earn as much as the man does and the house is under joint name - because she financially contributed in the marriage. She doesn’t have a secure roof over her head and has two kids to pay for as well since the guy isn’t signing the divorce papers and hence is not required to pay any maintenance. The legal system in India is super laid back so the question of timely interim maintenance doesn’t arise :) Thots and prayers se bach gaye bhai Must be crazy good in bed but. All crazy people are It's actually very common these days. Man's income doesn't go to the woman, it goes towards the general household expenses (electricity, grocery, vacations, etc). The woman's income is spent on herself and she doesn't ask the husband for anything. This can include clothes, jewelry, monthly salon/parlour, personal gifting, maid expenses etc. And yes, it is based on the assumption that the man makes more than the woman, so the man spends more (simply bcuz he can & they are a team). Both partners end up saving approximately the same amount of money. This approach is based on equity, instead of equality. If the woman also contributes 50-50 to household expenses, that would greatly diminish her savings & while the man gets to save a huge portion. This is detrimental to the woman who is also working the same number of hours + contributing to household work + future pregnancy/childcare responsibilities. At least, she should be able to save properly. The 2nd approach is based on this rationale. You suffer from this type of spouse yourself? No that's fine. The thing is you will work 10-12 hrs a day and bring 100k per month. She will do 6 hrs, bring 25k and expect you to do 50% or more house work as well in the name of equality. How much is she asking for alimony? >Guys cheat with other women by lying to them and saying they’re single / divorced. So yes, blame can’t be on both parties. Of course because it is scientifically documented that married woman are physically incapable of cheating. It is always married man cheating with young clueless unmarried women. >She will be giving birth to the kids and her career will suffer a setback because of it. The living expenses like food/ housing should come from the husband. So it is retaliation/punishment? Due to biology, he cannot give birth so he has to be financially responsible for everything. And you want him to contribute to other chores too? In this scenario, is the husband human even? Ohh, wait no, all men are pigs, got it. Also, if the birthing thing is so problematic, why not adopt? >There will be no court order since the guy won’t sign the divorce papers till the alimony amount is 0. Yes, because contested divorces and ex parte orders do not exist in Indian judiciary. >A guy will be living with his gf while still being married to the wife telling the Gf that he’s single. It’s legal in India to be living in with another woman while being married to somebody else. Any statistics to support your claim here? Since you are of the opinion that all cheaters are married men and they are living with unmarried women and they have all lied that they are single. I really would like to know this. >The emotional turmoil caused to the woman is unimaginable because in all likelihood the woman doesn’t earn as much as the man does and the house is under joint name - because she financially contributed in the marriage. She doesn’t have a secure roof over her head and has two kids to pay for as well since the guy isn’t signing the divorce papers and hence is not required to pay any maintenance. The legal system in India is super laid back so the question of timely interim maintenance doesn’t arise :) Then I would say that either you are terribly uneducated about the process or your lawyer is lying to you. Because you definitely can claim interim maintenance in a timely manner.

The basis of the claim for interim maintenance is that the claimant has no independent income of his/her own to support himself/herself. Andha Marriage Let me guess, big B and fair skin I am still wondering what wud b her practical contribution in the marriage or relationship. She is simply saying adopt me and pamper me....nd expect nothing. I ain't reading all that. Happy for you though. Or sorry that happened. Sorry for being rude BC baat kese kar li tune usse itni? TBH this ain't no arranged marriage this is more like agreement marriage You are in 2023 and you still want to cling on to martial terms of 1940's well it's your choice and it's you you should have been blaming !! But my question is, why call this AM? Since neither of your families are involved. Not from India, this is a genuine question 😂😂 You sound like a reasonable guy, I’m sure you’ll find someone on your wavelength. Financially not contribute to the marriage? What? How? Shouldn't a couple be like a single entity after a marriage? She'll buy you gifts with your money? Total nuts lady. You pay rent, grocery, bills and then she'll spend her money on make up? 🤣🤣 yes mate,in this case only... Then look for someone else. Trust your gut na. Forget about her, I’m sure she is not that good. 🛑 RED FLAG: She is not willing to pay her share of the bills. 🛑 RED FLAG: She wants you to take care of all her financial responsibilities. 🛑 She will never change. 🛑 Do not respond to her messages if she ever contacts you again. 🛑 Don't make the mistake of trying to change such people. Have you considered someone willing to be a housewife? Uhuhu That’s a weird tangent, I was trying to hint you to some basic laws of nature but you don’t see it. Why the fuck did Reddit recommended me r/India? Why the fuck did Reddit recommended me r/India? Dont worry dude, people that justify such behavior are most likely to be of the same feather. Plenty of such people online. >Some females will have unresolved childhood trauma such as not being popular in their friends circle..these type of girls look for a wealthy husband to show off to their friends. ooof >Lol emotional intelligence? Dude is sharing their chats with strangers. With zero identifiable markers. White knighting on the internet wont get you anywhere, my man. Not just families but acquaintances or even matrimony websites. In this particular instance, we both are managing our profiles so we talked directly, otherwise this would have come through our families. Been in a similar situation where girl was sending all lovey dovey messages on WhatsApp even before meeting, then the girls parents drop the bomb about fixed assets. And my go to line was “look, I got zero fixed assets. What ever we’ll have is what you and I will earn”. That filtered out a lot of paapa ki parees and gold diggers. It’s not easy to be a guy looking for an equal partner. If it may help: It’s rare to find someone who has the same outlook as you do unless => you filter their education level + career goals to be similar to yours (irrespective of whether they want to work after getting married or not). Hoping the best for you, cheers 👍🏼 > search for a partner or play stupid games They are not 'OR'. Those 'games' are actually how women choose a worthy mate. You look at a woman's profile, and she's got everything you're looking for (just based on profile and looks), you're mostly good to go. But it ain't the same for women, what women are looking for isn't someone who fits all their 'profile criteria', like height, age, religion, income, BUT, the most important criteria is whether or not a man can defend his wife, offspring, property etc against other men. How can a woman find that out? We don't live in the world where a woman can issue a Swayamvar challenge of wrestling with other men, or presenting a huge army. So women do what they know best, that is, what you describe as 'stupid games', but they are anything but stupid. It's no different than kicking on the tire of your car before you start a long journey. You don't do it because you hate your car or want to damage it, but if there is any problem with the wheel, you want it to be visible NOW, rather than on the road. Shit tests are HUGELY important in female psyche and stories. Only after a shit test, a woman truly relaxes enough with a man to love him (remember, a woman generally has thousands of men at a given time willing to be with her even for an hour, and in India, even to a mid, and to get married, there can be hundreds of men who want to be with her. Until she believes that the person she is with is capable in providing for her, and defending her, she's never going to relax. Thank you sharing your experience. >I want fairness, I want support, I want someone who is stuck on supporting and loving each other, not on some age old custom just for the sake of heritage. Tradition is just peer pressure by dead people. You should do what works for you. It is good that you understood what you wanted and became free than being a relationship you are not free in. And to be honest, what you are asking is just basic stuff. >So yaar, leave her, and talk to MORE people. It’s about your whole life after all. Don’t settle just like that. Yeah definitely. Thanks It’s about the principles. That was meant to be a private conversation and this guy just casually shares it online with absolutely no necessity and which added nothing to his case. A prime example of a ‘red flag’ you guys are leading around with. And ‘whiteknighting’? Lol gtfo not everyone is that pathetic. How can I check my Cibil score on Google Pay? I typed Cibil in the search bar and nothing showed up. A modern hypersonic missile Well, It is true face of feminism women just want freedom not to take responsibility of anything. Just ghost her my friend, don't reply or chat anymore. You have no idea how blissful single life is. >BUT, the most important criteria is whether or not a man can defend his wife, offspring, property etc against other men The fuck kind of a war zone you living in, woman? This is not medieval times. You are not Helen of Troy. No one is sending an army to get you. Pipe down. You are a grown ass woman. Take responsibility of your own self. Learn some skills. Don't put that responsibility on your husband. And how are you expecting him to protect you? Be by your side 24x7? You don't need a husband, you need a security guard. Hire an armed escort. Or better yet build a moat around your house. Seriously, yaar. You survived 25-30 years without the man in your life, you can survive the next 25-30 too. > It's no different than kicking on the tire of your car before you start a long journey. You don't do it because you hate your car or want to damage it, but if there is any problem with the wheel, you want it to be visible NOW, rather than on the road. By that logic you should be body slamming the car every day to make sure there is no problem with the body too in case of an accident. Do that. And get it on video. SMH. Globally, we are talking about woman empowerment and then here you come, traipsing along with your women need to be protected like property, let's have a modern swayamvar comment. In just one sentence, you equated women and children with property and called them equally weak and helpless which need to be protected. I already had low expectations when you said shit tests but damn. I can actually feel my brain regress reading your comment. >And my go to line was “look, I got zero fixed assets. What ever we’ll have is what you and I will earn”. That filtered out a lot of paapa ki parees and gold diggers. lol, bravo man! Good of you to cut through that crap. I would suggest you to try SoulUp's (they got funded in Shark Tank India) \\*\\*\\*arranged marriage search support group\\*\\*\\* led by therapist. 4-5 participants, done in 4 sessions over 4 weeks via Zoom calls.

I was on the matrimony shopping app briefly. The people are very pushy to get a response. Parents were on my whatsapp like sales people following up - we are expecting a decision soon yadda yadda (despite telling them my folks will be in touch if we want to proceed). Another instance girl directly messaged on WhatsApp (fair enough) - we chatted for a couple of days and she wanted to know financials and my balance sheet. Even my accountant doesn't dig that deep. I stopped responding and deleted the profile. [https://www.soulup.in/products/navigating-the-process-of-arranged-marriage](https://www.soulup.in/products/navigating-the-process-of-arranged-marriage) Arrange marriage is like that, I don't think she is wrong in her expectations and wants. You can just move on. >Shouldn't a couple be like a single entity after a marriage? Ab ye inko kaun samjhaye? Arranged marriage is similar to mail order bride concept. You as the guy are supposed to provide financially and there are many simps who are willing to do the so to ensure they don’t die virgins. Here are the women i would definitely avoid in arranged marriage and I advocate every guy the same. 1) fatherless : a woman without a strong father tend to be not so wifey material. Speaking of exp, all the promiscuous women I've seen or dealt didn't have good father's or poor/drunk father's who couldn't take care of them well. 2) feminist women or have some qualities of feminism: I will straight reject them if they follow even one feminst page on insta. These women will not let you live with your family, they won't partake in family chores. They believe the world revolves around them and they believe they are making you a big favor by marrying you. They want equality but not accountability. 3) woman who has multiple boyfriends or has male friends: these woman are attention seekers and will seek male attention even after marriage. They lose the ability to pair bond with one man. You can't do anything because she will call you insecure and or blackmail you of divorce and you will lose everything you worked for. 4) woman who's willing to be independent and wants to work even after marriage: These women will either cheat on you or divorce you if you put pressure on her.. they have been told that if a man leaves you you need to be able to take care of yourself on your own. They will not listen to you, they wont compromise on small things either and will always say 'im an independent working class woman i don't need you' when things won't go in their way. They won't contribute to the family, they won't take up family chores and the higher she earns the lesser she will think of you and may cheat on you. I've dealt met seen multiple woman in my life including family, friends, colleagues, exes one night stands etc and these are what i have learnt about modern day women. Support feminism?? Ewwwww.... > How are you sure that your computer doesn't have a keylogger on it? r/iamverysmart It is very revealing how being security conscious is looked down upon by the smartphone generation. > r/iamverysmart That doesn't answer my question. Also I support people being security conscious People are but no one really gives a fuck about it, how many women u know who don't shave hair on their hands, or makeup etc etc. Maybe she was trying to get out of the date I am pretty sure about there being no keylogger on my computer. Because I personally downloaded and checked the Ubuntu iso that I installed after erasing the pre-TPM Dual Core desktop that I assembled. I keep up to date with patches. I use ublock Origin. I don't visit porn sites or religious sites (which are worse). My salary depends on me being competent in this matter for about 100 computers and 20 servers. I have personally cleaned 3 different types of hacks on my servers and rescued data from ransomware infected disks using Testdisk and photorec. I'm in IT since 2002 and I generally know what I am doing. So kid, please fuck off. fair enough but you know you couldn't just said that earlier without being condescending or getting ticked off? > How are you sure that your computer doesn't have a keylogger on it? Says the guy that wrote this. that was a genuine question Well, as they say, non verbal cues are absent in text based communication. And statistically, reddit has more edgy comments than genuine discussions. Anyways, if your intent wasn't malicious, my apologies. In my defense, I said that > I use a desktop / laptop that I know is secured. and > I don't travel much, and that helps which means that I do not use networks that I am not in control of. I thought that was sufficient explanation. Sorry for the anger. It's alright , Im also interested in securing everything I own and also do most of the steps youve mentioned If you're interested in general banter, (ignore if otherwise) just a year ago, I had a friend who clicked a link on Whatsapp and that led to a whole lot of things getting on his phone. Unfortunately I don't have the setup to do a forensic analysis (nor the experience to do it cleanly) but the result of all that was a police investigation, an excessive phone bill (postpaid) and his SIM being blocked. Back in 2019, a wave of attacks occurred where potentially thousands of users had Remote Access Trojan (RAT) apps installed on their phones through links shared on Whatsapp ( [MBS hacking Bezos' phone was a famous example](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince) ). Which obviously led to bigger issues like bank accounts being emptied ( [UPI amount change hack](https://www.google.com/search?q=UPI+payment+++amount+parameter+change+vulnerability+CVE) ), passwords to other accounts being leaked, spear phishing, spamming and so on. Most people in India are completely unaware of all these dozens of attack vectors - all through the smartphone, because it is a full fledged computer without much transparency into the internals (unless you know how to root your phone and install a secure FOSS android). Add to that the attempts at Deep Packet Inspection that ISPs like Jio do, and DNS tracking, blocking, etc that Airtel too does. I just skip all that complexity and use a desktop / laptop and do financial transactions from my home network. Why? The dating market is a shambles these days.... 'enough options to get through that'? I think thats a stretch. There are options, but the odds are slim and expensive. Personally as a feminist, I value my independence more than go dumpster diving for companionship through arranged marriage. Your way of thinking is an exception. Op is having a tough time in general, ideal matches toh door ki baat hai. These ideal skills screening sound good on paper but have little relevance when it comes to reality. No offense, but scientifically women marry across and above in the socio-economic scale. Having an equal partner is literally the last ditch choice they want in general. On average they prefer marrying someone with at least 50% more income(as per data) + as clearly highlighted in this context too where she wanted him to bear all financial responsibilities. So yeh equal ka sawaal in terms of skills and thoughts will never practically materialise for the vast majority and that's where gender roles will inevitably come into the picture. Are new-age couples more leaning towards equal partnerships yeah but you'd still see some sense of traditional roles in most households that maintain equilibrium. True that. And I went through the screenshot and god she can't even form a single coherent or grammatically correct sentence in english. Was there any silver lining - perhaps her looks? Matrimony and all these platforms should contain a ‘NO FEMINIST’ filter. Let this be a lesson.. be upfront don’t excuse her behavior and let her know you are not to marry her and state your reasons don’t let her overpower you! These women will get what they want and tear you like shit.. it’s called narcissism just Google that and you will see these signs That's quite scary, thanks for letting me know I know a lot of arranged marriages, where women are treated as equals and the marriages are successful. I also know lots of love marriages that went up in flames. I am not saying one is better than the other. They seem to have an equal rate of success/failure. Ultimately, its the people involved that make the marriage successful or not. Simp: I can fix her Simp or not, one of the biggest mistakes people make while choosing a partner is assuming he/she is going to change Tell me the difference between sharing chats with zero identifiable markers vs transcribing and writing it in the rant post as, she said, i said. OR do you want OP to not rant/vent at all? lmao. Would you say the same if OP was the girl and was ranting about a guy ? I doubt that. Significantly more than the percentage of women who would marry someone with a lower income. Please, lets not pretend thats not the case. This is not exclusive to the arranged marriage setting. Ah, I get it now, thanks Honestly, sometimes the best way to deal with this seems to be to just let your parents find someone for you, I mean if you're going for an AM anyway, why not just let them do it for? Then if it fails you can always just blame them for failing to find someone right for you lmao. What will happen if you blame them ? Does that make your life any better ? Indian parents always have these things to say to make us emotional. Going through the same >Indian parents always have these things to say to make us emotional. Going through the same I understand exactly what you're talking about. Even though I'm not quite marriageable age yet, ever since I started living away from home, I can feel the emotional blackmailing creeping up from my mother's part. Sometimes you just have to bear through it; marriage is a complex institution, even more so in India. If you can't find someone yourself, or the person your family finds for you turns out not to be the right one, then you're left with nothing more than long-term emotional pain and regret. It's either accepting that your parents failed and making them aware of it, or living with it. It doesn't even have to be exactly \"blaming\". Here is a wicked question you can ask such future prospects, 'why I should choose you over a full time maid?' 28 M here in the same boat as you. I have a decent package (around 1.4L PM) with a decent car, house, no loans and everything and i have had few girls reach out to me for marriage discussion and stuff via Online sites. My experience also has been terrible with these so called independent girls. We have come to a point where the roles & responsibilities of a man (protecting, providing, having a family, etc) is still traditional just like our fathers generation but the roles & responsibilities of most of the girls have been so much degraded that it feels unreal sometimes. A girl with 10-15k salary will also very confidently demand a guy with 1L salary and still expect him to take care of house and everything. It has reached a point where most of these girls can live a very happy and easy life without even having any real life skills and just talking to them show how much dumb and disconnected from real life they are. Unfortunately, i just got a new phone 2 weeks back or else i would have shown you guys some of my chats to see how dumb and entitled these girls are. Maybe next time i will take screenshots of such chats too 😂 Isn’t this the typical scenario in most of Indian Arrange Marriages? Girls usually look for someone with a good ‘overall package’ iykwim and guys on the other hand look for a genuine connection in a girl that they have to spend their life with. 99% of AMs will be a combination of a guy who is better than the girl in almost every aspect (be it physical, financial, mental, etc) but still the girl will have an attitude as if she is superior one who has done a favour to the guy by marrying him. Unfortunately, the reason behind this is the guy itself since they will still give a chance and marry to such low value girls even after knowing that they just want money so girls just keep on enjoying the benefit of it all. Proud of you bro, you got a strong spine Dont know why but this made me lol Chats share karke uski mentality samajh aati hai. 498a case ho gaya to iski Puri family pe asar ho jaega On a slightly different note, a friend had tried this group on SoulUp which talks through the arranged marriage process - and helps you understand how to navigate it ( family expectations, mindfully evaluating your partner, setting boundaries etc.) . Found it useful. Here's the link - It's done via Zoom sessions and in small groups of 5-7 people so its pretty helpful from what I have heard. Given you are on a journey to find your partner through arranged marriage, we're running a 4-week online support group that could be relevant. The group will have 6-8 members, will be led by a therapist and discussions will be anchored around themes like - exploring what you want, disentangling your wants from conditioning, coordinating with important stakeholders - parents/family and communicating with a prospective partner. Group starts 7th Jan. Here's the link if you think it could be relevant - [https://www.soulup.in/products/navigating-the-process-of-arranged-marriage](https://www.soulup.in/products/navigating-the-process-of-arranged-marriage) With that English who is giving her a job anyway ? End of discussion I was on jeevanasathi.com for sometime, most of the people were like that. They would start conversation with - “what is your salary?” Do you have green card? “ I used to stop the conversation right away - no explanation given or asked. Don’t waste your time on garbage people. Red flag is a red flag, don’t give any benefit of doubt, life is at stake. as a woman stepping into AM process, i feel sorry for that girl, good you dodged the bullet. victim mentality anywhere is toxic when you project the frustration on people who have nothing to do with it. I hope a dog marries her Damn, my friend got married into a similar scenario. Believe me, he feels like he has adopted a kid. His wife had no plan of working or freelancing even after months of buying her courses to earn certificates and work on. Hence, once he lied about getting their pay cut and may get laid off, and the next day overheard his wife taking to her friend over call saying that she can just sit around and depend on him as he might be of no use. She has a maid for everything, cooking, dusting, washing utensils, mopping, etc. She said she should have a maid who could getwasher clothes out from the machine and hang to dry. Honestly, I felt very bad for him. He thought he was in love with this person, but she was a fake flag bearer of feminism. Arranged marriage in 2024? What's wrong with your country? You should be ashamed. What demands did you have to face before marriage, which you ignored?"
