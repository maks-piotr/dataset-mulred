        "As someone too familiar with placements at IITs(I was part of one in 2017), itâ€™s quite obvious what the root cause is. IITs arenâ€™t really that good at placing people in non-software companies. Until recently, the demand for software jobs was very high and that reflected in the high number of placements. But, now, software industry is in a downturn and also, there has been a deluge of CS graduates, including non IITians. An IIT non-CS student isnâ€™t much better than a CS student from a tier-2 university. So, that advantage is gone.\n\nWhat we are seeing is a market correction of inflated IIT placement numbers. And, it will sustain in the future too.",
        "How bad is situation for non computer jobs? My daughter is preparing for jee advanced but may choose private college ( Manipal /BITS/VIT etc) to stay in CS. \n\nHow good are NITs or IIITs ( Indian institutes of information technology) for non CS branches",
        "This was pretty common previous years too, median hovered around 15-20 lpa in old iits and lowest was around 4 lpa. The thing that is different this year is that the companies that used to hire 8 people now hire 3, due to recession.",
        "The technology cycle has taken a downturn it will take few years to recover, every generation has to face the music",
        "Totally depends on the branch and the college, some top IIITs had pretty normal placements this year but NITs [suffered](https://np.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1cdx8i2/placement_of_nit_allahabad_prayagraj/) a lot.\n\nAlso BITS > Manipal > VIT generally.",

        "Downturn definitely. But we don't know if the it jobs we have now will go back up. Because profits of companies are all time high and even their operating leverage. In downturn profits become low and so does operating leverage. \n\nSo the current downcycle can also mean the it jobs we had till now might be replaced with something new.",
        "Yes, as I said, IT hiring is not doing well recently, but IIT does not teach IT only. Jobs are doing very well, otherwise, across the world, but not in India: cue Modi.",
        "The government is busy building \"smart\" everything, rather than building smart people (investing in education). At a time when AI is at your doorstep or even has already entered the home, a government that keeps reducing the budget on education and wants just factory slaves and Hindu-Muslim rioters ... how self-destructive this is!

That's the sole reason that some companies only hire fro Harvard, or IIT, or xyz.",
        "Ummâ€¦.like most faculty at IITs.",
        "Old IITs CS are a different game altogether. Theyâ€™re great because of the quality of students. But I reckon CS salaries from other colleges are catching up for Indian grads. \n\nPersonally, I donâ€™t rate IIT masters or PhDs (even CS) and it gets worse at faculty level. Have you seen the kind of science published these days?",
        "Absolutely agree. The market reflects this. For technical jobs I get why old IIT btechs from specific branches are amazing. Iâ€™m referring to the job market in India that requires increasingly diverse  set of skills",

        "I thought it was the global tech slowdown",
        "Itâ€™s a common misconception that most premier education institute students end up with high paying jobs right out the gate. Iâ€™m sure there are many (at least 20% or so of old IITs, top NITs etc) who start at 3-8LPA. What differentiates them is their growth path/switching after that first job. Network effects and brand value play a huge role. Many jobs advertise as ordinary college + MBA or IIT + 2 years experience. Know many guys who started at 3-5LPA and doing 50-75LPA within 6-8 years with several avenues for further growth still open. One of the key things I guess they did is they switched their line of work whenever it was necessary/more financially sensible.",
        "This reminds me of Subramaniam Swamy's recent statement that India's GDP number are false, real value is at around 4% and we will be seeing repercussions of this clearly in the next few years.",

        "that's why I didn't get troubled by not being able to get in IIT or NIT, because IT is a field where if you put enough hardwork you can get a lovely job, doesn't matter how shit college you have.",
        "It's all bogeyman tactics trying to say the hiring is not happening because of AI and whatnot. The reality is that due to monetary tightening with the fed in the US, VC money has dried up and hence the outrageous pay packages as well.\n\nThings are returning back to pre-Covid levels and lower and at the same time firms are hiring less because they want to become profitable at the cost of work-life balance of the employees and making employees work overtime without pay as is usual in India.",
        "Things are turning harder. Canada is awful, Australia is about to reach it's limits. UK is in a bad condition, Europe is not as easy as people think.  \nIt is only people here who haven't stepped abroad think it is easy. Once, you move abroad, it is way harder than anyone can imagine.",
        "Just a question will it recover and greaty improve if Rahul papu gets elected ?  \nWhat kind of idiotic attitude is this?  \nThere is slower hiring in Europe since last year. It will take sometime to rebound.",
        "It is bloody 0.3 % and it started this Quarter. Europe was in slumber last year.  \n[https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/30/economy/europe-dodges-recession-2023/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/30/economy/europe-dodges-recession-2023/index.html)",
        "Sorry, jobs are doing well in Europe too, and doing fantastically well in the U.S.: do not source your information from WhatsApp university. And, of course, India's ills were brought about by a completely incompetent PM who rules currently, and if he goes, things would look up to some extent, but the incompetent PM has already wrought too much damage to India, some of it irreversible.",
        "Dear oh dear, the logic of those who are supposedly educated. 0.3% growth for a country already developed like Germany and slow growth for a country like India who is far behind even China (another developing country) are very different things.",
        "For a smart guy like you who knows that developed economies grow slowly, you didn't know that they should also have lower unemployment rates lol!  \nBut all you want to engage is shaming people who oppose you okay.  \nBTW the graph is at 5.5 in the x-axis if you didn't see it.",
        "Being a developed economy has no correlation with unemployment rate! I think I am done now talking with a WhatsApp university graduate."

It's all bogeyman tactics trying to say the hiring is not happening because of AI and whatnot. The reality is that due to monetary tightening with the fed in the US, VC money has dried up and hence the outrageous pay packages as well. Things are returning back to pre-Covid levels and lower and at the same time firms are hiring less because they want to become profitable at the cost of work-life balance of the employees and making employees work overtime without pay as is usual in India. Things are turning harder. Canada is awful, Australia is about to reach it's limits. UK is in a bad condition, Europe is not as easy as people think. It is only people here who haven't stepped abroad think it is easy. Once, you move abroad, it is way harder than anyone can imagine. Just a question will it recover and greaty improve if Rahul papu gets elected ? What kind of idiotic attitude is this? There is slower hiring in Europe since last year. It will take sometime to rebound. It is bloody 0.3 % and it started this Quarter. Europe was in slumber last year.

And, of course, India's ills were brought about by a completely incompetent PM who rules currently, and if he goes, things would look up to some extent, but the incompetent PM has already wrought too much damage to India, some of it irreversible. Dear oh dear, the logic of those who are supposedly educated. 0.3% growth for a country already developed like Germany and slow growth for a country like India who is far behind even China (another developing country) are very different things. For a smart guy like you who knows that developed economies grow slowly, you didn't know that they should also have lower unemployment rates lol! But all you want to engage is shaming people who oppose you okay. BTW the graph is at 5.5 in the x-axis if you didn't see it. Being a developed economy has no correlation with unemployment rate! I think I am done now talking with a WhatsApp university graduate."
