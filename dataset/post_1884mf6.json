        "I mean really I understand it is hard to maintain cleanliness when there are lakhs of passengers aboard the train daily. \n\nHowever it is not an impossible task to do. It all comes down to management and government. Because people in the administration eat up the money and don't give 2 shits about anything else, the lower division employees and cleaners can only do so much.\n\nFor every coach and train, not just 1st class, there should be enough ground force with reasonable pay to maintain hygiene and cleanliness at least in the bathrooms. This can be done only when people take their jobs seriously and jobs are generated as well. \n\nAlso Indians really fall back even after so many campaigns and everything to be aware enough on how to use public spaces because if used properly the state of affairs wouldn't be like this.\n\nAlso it does not comes with education. I was aboard Vande Bharat 2 weeks ago, a family of  3 adult 3 kids along with their helper were traveling. They were all seated in the middle seat which has 6 seats facing each other together (happened because 3 people including me and my partner switched due to kids being noisy). \n\nNow I am not inhuman and understand how kids can be and I never objected to them talking screaming crying very very loudly and playing along the coach like actual maniacs for nearly 4 hours in a 7 hour journey. The adults were educated people, they were gossiping and using their phones all along the journey instead of disciplining their kids. These kids , 3 of them literally coloured the eating tables bad, threw cups n paper's all along journey here and there, were loud as hell and also threw socks at each other which landed on my lap multiple times. But the parents never batted an eye let alone discipline them. \n\nNow I had to say this only to show it's not just about education but mere personal and social values as well and I really really hope the society starts learning how to behave in public.\n\nI have always travelled via train but hardly ever in my life used the bathrooms in them. Hope people get responsible and government more efficient in future.",

        "I feel it's more to do with management. Railways are known for their mediocre and lazy approach in many places although they maybe are trying to improve.\n\nHere they need proper administration of staff on ground level. What happens is that mostly the staff will clean once when train is at the source station and then just leave it for the rest of the journey. Even when passengers are aboard, if managed rightly, a team of 2 for every 2 coaches can easily clean the bathrooms once in every 2-3 hours maybe even 4. Passengers can wait 10-15 mins whike they clean. \n\nThis will only happen if the staff on the train is trained or held liable in doing so which will come to happen if their upper authority makes it a firm part of the job role.",
        "I’ve never traveled in any train except of Mumbai local and this comment is my final sign to never do so",

        "I’ve traveled across Europe in trains like that’s fine but within India I have never and don’t plan to ever either the only trains I do travel is Mumbai local that too first class",
        "Never been to India but I have travelled by train in Japan and they're amazing",
        "Yeah flights is good but check-ins & security ruins the whole experience. I mean 2 hrs before the flight and restrictions on what to carry and whatnot is an exhausting task.",
        "That too gets avoided if you travel Buisniss but I’m sure economy isn’t as bad as trains it’s so much better",
        "Happens when uncivilized are rich.",
        "Now a days its going more towards cleanliness. Earlier it was not that clean."

    "light_cleaned_title": "My experience travelling with Indian railways",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "•I was coming back from Nanded to Ahmedabad by train in 1st ac and our coach was right next to the general/sleeper coach •Also i travel by train rarely •The experience was unacceptable ( I was prepared it was gonna be dirty but not this much ) the seats had dirt , wrappers , some liquid etc •Cockroaches were roaming around , there was a very tangent smell( we used our personal perfume ) I paid the cleaner ₹100 from my pocket just to use fenyl and clean the seats The bathroom was literally disgusting , i almost vomitted ( people from general/sleeper class were using it ) Also I tweeted and tagged irctc about this so someone locked the door between general and 1st ac but then again those food sellers ( example chai Lelo , paaani Lelo ) opened the door to get into general class So overall , I don't recommend anyone to use indian railways I'm attaching some pics below Also I got an message automatically that my problem was resolved ( like wtf )",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "My image is a camera photo and it was taken inside the train 22723 I kid you not, when I visited home(from US) in Feb even the domestic flights had disgusting toilets. I don’t know why most of us have zero sense of hygiene. AC is the new general bro Govt should restrict the entry between the classes. Like how it is done in companies with Access card. Service quality of AC class have deteriorated heavily these days Compared to pre 2017 They only focus on vande bharat No cap Indians are having audacity to compare it with shinkansen lmao I didn’t need to see that second image . I just puked my breakfast OK that is outright disgusting and its a sorry state you had to travel in. Did you Tweet this to the IRCTC handles? They'll need your PNR, Date of Travel and Blah Blah. I think there are just too many railway staff in our country but very little actual ground force for coach maintenance, which is not very helpful. While focus has shifted to the Vande Bharat trains etc, the regular old trains are just in an insufferable condition. You can smell these pictures. Yep I did tweet and share my pnr , details etc But after a couple of hours they automatically resolved the problem ( wtf ) I guess it all comes down to money. When the people in charge of cleaning are not paid enough don't expect an extraordinary cleanliness. 🤣🤣🤣 Speaking of access cards, some trains abroad have this system. excuse me..how can you attack chai lelo guys so casually /s It is also about basic civic sense. What snobs in the comments.. trains are for \"travelling\" to and fro a place to another. It's not your personal room or bathroom. Deal with it or arrange \"hygienic means\" per your convinience. &#x200B; As per a friend, When he was working in railways, we did hat we could but it is really hard to keep things clean after lakhs of passengers pass through the train per day. All those complaints to Irctc does is give pressure to the little guys from higher Ups who dont have to deal with all this. He has moved on in life to better jobs but still..Don't be a Snob. We wont be like Japan or Us anytime soon. This work has been contracted out to private companies, they did good early on but realised they don't need to thus the sorry state of things now. Selling off small parts of public systems to worse than government incompetence is the new way to become a 5 trillion dollar economy. Next time please mark it as nsfw I refrain from using Indian railways. All over crowded, dirt af, people with no civic sense and crying brats all the time. Vande Bharat is much better, else I drive my car Generally 1st AC boggies are linked with 2nd ones and thereafter 3rd one then sleeper than general I don't know how this is possible? Can you give me the rain no. Op? *Aapko hui asuvidha ke liye hume khed hai* Unfortunately flights are the only saviour, I am yet to convince my parents(especially my dad) to prefer flights over trains but still finding it super difficult to switch them 🥲 I'm traveling in a train rn with my pet after 10-15 years and the image the Railway minister had portrayed is a sham just as the government. Disgusting. Travelling on the road the next time onwards. >hard to keep things clean after lakhs of passengers pass through the train per day. Then hire more employees lol Wasn't it always like that...what were you expecting?? I travelled from Delhi to Chennai and given such reviews of rajdhani and drunken staffs I chose the railway controlled by the southern railways; Duronto and I am so glad I did as the service and cleanliness was definitely good also given they clean every room twice a day. Btw, this train travel was my first in the last 25 years. 22723 There are 2 general bogies, one at the front right infront of AC1 and another at the tail to avoid congestion I mean really I understand it is hard to maintain cleanliness when there are lakhs of passengers aboard the train daily. However it is not an impossible task to do. It all comes down to management and government. Because people in the administration eat up the money and don't give 2 shits about anything else, the lower division employees and cleaners can only do so much. For every coach and train, not just 1st class, there should be enough ground force with reasonable pay to maintain hygiene and cleanliness at least in the bathrooms. This can be done only when people take their jobs seriously and jobs are generated as well. Also Indians really fall back even after so many campaigns and everything to be aware enough on how to use public spaces because if used properly the state of affairs wouldn't be like this. Also it does not comes with education. I was aboard Vande Bharat 2 weeks ago, a family of 3 adult 3 kids along with their helper were traveling. They were all seated in the middle seat which has 6 seats facing each other together (happened because 3 people including me and my partner switched due to kids being noisy). Now I am not inhuman and understand how kids can be and I never objected to them talking screaming crying very very loudly and playing along the coach like actual maniacs for nearly 4 hours in a 7 hour journey. The adults were educated people, they were gossiping and using their phones all along the journey instead of disciplining their kids. These kids , 3 of them literally coloured the eating tables bad, threw cups n paper's all along journey here and there, were loud as hell and also threw socks at each other which landed on my lap multiple times. But the parents never batted an eye let alone discipline them. Now I had to say this only to show it's not just about education but mere personal and social values as well and I really really hope the society starts learning how to behave in public. I have always travelled via train but hardly ever in my life used the bathrooms in them. Hope people get responsible and government more efficient in future. Throughout my childhood, I always used to fear using toilets and would just pee on the other track... Even after that i completely stopped using toilets and our travel used to be two days long.. Now we always travel in 2nd ac even though we miss those toys , books, jewelery sellers. I don't know why but now even ac compartments are getting so bad . Also your statement of trains are only for travelling, true but they are freaking service providers and this is the bare minimum which we expect them to provide, we just simply pay more so that we get more services or just quality services... We aren't donating especially when the prices match the flight prices It looks like a Lego train compared to a shinkansen. These issues will not be fixed because the upper-middle class will increasingly be using airplanes for long-distance travel. For short-distance travel they are going to be using their cars. Trains have been underinvested in India for a long time because the top 10% can increasingly \"opt out\" of that system in a way they couldn't 20-30 years ago. The superrich never used trains but at least some decades back, car and airplane usage was much lower. Classic case of \"tragedy of the commons\".

I travel very often and toilets are way way way worse than this , toilets without a large stain of poop is a very rare find in indian railways . Once i was travelling from Delhi to Kolkata, but unfortunately i couldnt get a ticket on rajdhani so i booked a ticket on Purba express...i was in first class and just like OP my coach was right beside a non-ac coach...u r not gonna believe but i saw ppl sleeping on the corridor outside the cabins...i was soo uncomfortable morally Hey , I was travelling with my sister how do u expect a girl to pee in a toilet like this ?? We mostly travel by plane but Nanded didn't even have a working airport Yes we are The Third World Country. Aren't you mixing two things? The ticket resolution is done when you SMS the IRCTC helpline to get assistance (and they choose to ignore you). The Tweet will help spread awareness and try to catch the eyes of the bigger railway babus and ministers if you tag them. Eww never travelling in trains. its nasty. The end of his sentence claims it’s hard to do it, but than mentions two other places who do it well despite difficulty. And says not to become it? general is now even worse Now at this moment I prefer sleeper buses the gutkha/pan masala is still rolling to the toilet seat🤢🤮 \"The bathroom was literally disgusting , i almost vomitted ( people from general/sleeper class were using it )\" OP, you're a classist sleazebag, you just don't have the self awareness to know it. I get that you're unhappy about the condition of restrooms on trains, but your ask should be that all train users, regardless of the class of fare they pay have access to clean and hygienic restrooms. Otherwise, you got exactly what you deserve, tatti sungho aur nashe me jhoomo. Never in mine life I have seen all clean toilets in a couch. Always get poop jumpscare Ok i understand your point , but I told the staff to clean it and they did but sorry if u get offended but those(most of them) people don't have any basic hygiene if they can use the toilet and it's still clean then I have no problem I stick to only Mumbai Pune trains and Shatabdis. bhai toilet ki photo ki zarorat nahi thi mai khana kha raha i wish i could afford flights all the time man. i am tweeting this as i am feeling disgusted by the filth of my 2nd AC berth. I developed tinnitus after traveling in Indian railways Literally. The moment I visualise Indian railways, there's this stench that automatically gives me a feel. More than the cleaners its the people who uses them. No one bothers to flush or clean after they use. Sounds like you have a bigger problem with the plebs venturing into your exclusive fiefdom than with the general terrible services by the railways. Elite Coach They do that actually. They close down the access to AC coaches from the General Sleeper coaches. I've noticed that everytime I've travelled with IR. Strange why this wasn't the case for OP. South central trains ac bogies are always well maintained,well cleaned...i have travelled so many times but never found any flaws Nothing about this coach looks like what you'd expect when you hear the word \"First Class\" lmfaoo. Railways are slowly decreasing the general or non AC coaches because it doesn't give them as revenue as AC ones You gotta love the pee and whatnot covered bathroom floor. Second AC used to be decent back in the days 😐. So much classist behaviour. \"General/sleeper should not be allowed to use AC toilets\" getting more emphasis than general/sleeper having proper toilets. We don't care even if you travel in toilets, just don't cross it to upper side and burden us with the stench. Why ac is new sleeper? Because there are not enough sleeper coaches. Why sleeper is new general? Because there are not enough general coaches. And it's not the population issue. It's inability to accommodate the population we have by not increasing the resources. Bas kyuki tumhara standard non existent iska ye matlab nahi ki sab tumhari tarah hain 🤡. This is downright unacceptable for most of us. Thank God! We own a car before I was born and avoided public transport most of the times. I mean, just because it is the way it is doesn't mean we don't speak up about it right? General is the new platform Ik you paid a premium price to travel in 1st ac and you had a bad experience which is disappointing for you but don't you think \" I don't recommend anyone to use indian railways\" is a pretty big statement to say Yeah, blame the system, bravo. It's the fucking people who think they own everything they pay to use services of. We are the only ones who experience both the khed and the asuvidha 😂. They're least bothered. I don't know about other trains but the one by which I travel by is far better than this Even China has the same population. What do you think is the difference? standard non existent mera nahi hai … bachapan se train ki halat buri hai thats why i am conditioned … People here are so out of touch with reality … Bhai kitne train me travel kiya hai ? I am expecting nothing from anyone … all i am saying that this is very good from India railways standards SWR is pretty clean, i’ve traveled a lot. Once I bought my trusty ev. I have never used trains. Im from Kerala, KSEB fast charging (60Kw) stations currently gives us 1Kw for 10.51rs. (Yep i get 7Km for 10.51rs with AC). (Just over 1rs for 1km) My last longest trip on train was Goa to Kerala. Man I didnt brush or went to pee or poop for a 10+ journey. Waited till i reached hotel to dump the load imao. The bathrooms are just horrible. Bas kyuki conditioned ho iska ye matlab nahi ki accept karloge. Speaking up has little effect, but not doing so has no effect! Bhot baar travel kiya hai and I regret not complaining every single time I was subjected to the atrocity that Indian Railways presents us tax payers every time with. the smell of piss Dried piss* That's clean as per Indian standards bro. Have you visited public toilets in the rest of India. Chinese population is also not known for their cleanliness and civic sense. Lol I don't see the problem. When I was scrolling through the pictures before I read your text I didn't know you had a __negative__ experience so when I saw the picture of the toilet I was like ''ow yeah, no shit everywhere, nice''. It's a train in India what do you expect. This is dirty by Western standards but I've seen far far far worse in India and other countries. The sheer volume of passengers and trains presents a significant challenge in maintaining cleanliness. Additionally, the infrastructure might not always match the growing demands, leading to wear and tear. The focus on immediate operations sometimes overshadowed the need for consistent maintenance. Efforts like the Swachh Rail, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and various cleanliness drives have been launched to address these issues. Moreover, cultural factors, habits, and the lack of awareness among passengers about maintaining cleanliness also contribute to the challenge. It's an issue that requires continuous efforts and coordinated actions from various stakeholders to achieve improvements in cleanliness and maintenance across the Indian railways. Sorry to say, but north Indian generally lacks cleanliness and hygiene. Be it the people, trains or roads. General population doesn’t even find being filthy and living inside filth as a problem at all. Abhi Bhakts aaege: \" Kabhi Congress ke time pe travel kia hai kya???.... Tab to AC coach hi nahi tha.. Thanks to Moi Ji Jo abhi abhi AC chalu Kia hai... JNU Wale Deshdrohi Yep, that's about right No. government is fed up of those who are not paying for ticket , if u travel in general there will 6 in 10 who have not payed for tickets. > have not *paid* for tickets. FTFY. Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in: * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.* * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.* Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment. *Beep, boop, I'm a bot* nice, they got Western Style toilets :O Roof is the new AC almost all the trains running from Marathwada/Vidarbha region are dirty. once i had booked SL coach ticket and bruh it was horrible i couldn't sleep the entire night 💀 Ek baar mein Chennai se Ahmedabad aaya tha. COINCIDENTALLY WO TRAIN BIHAR SE AAYI THI. WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE USKE BAAD MUJHE LOG KYON PLANE PREFER KARTE HAI WO SAMJH AA GAYA. EVEN US DABBE KI YAAD KARTE HI GHINN AATI HAI. NEVER GONNA TRAVEL IN TRAIN AGAIN. Cleanliness Part is the responsibility of both, primarily of the Railway Authorities and then, a portion belongs to the passengers themselves. The people are so so careless, like you said, wrappers thrown around!? - Everyone likes a clean space but no one would keep that chips wrapper with them until they find a dust bin cause the whole wide coach is one. The toilet itself, basic courtesy to use flush and doing the business inside the pot is too much to be expected. So basically, animal behaviour is exhibited by passengers. Ofcourse, Authorities themselves have always been lax too. And sadly, only a miniscule percentage of those trash throwing passengers would be on reddit, rest can't be reached out. 2 tier me ye halat thi meri. General dabbe ka pucho hi matt. totally😂😂 Urine smell and indian railways are inseparable😄 The last time I had traveled in train was in 2017 when I had traveled in 2AC from Delhi to Mumbai. Prior to that I had traveled many times by sleeper class. Had never faced issues of smell and dirty seats. Had even traveled in packed trains on Mumbai to Goa route during peak season but didn't have much issues. It's obvious now that the government is wilfully neglecting all trains in favour of Vande Bharat. It is not the norm, but nowadays it depends on the attendant assigned to the ac compartment. There are few of them whom you will never see during your journey as they are busy sleeping or chilling with their friends. But yeah those days when the ac compartments were cleaned, mosquito repellents and room freshners were sprayed, bathrooms cleaned in every few hours are long gone Although i dont support IR in anyway...i think in todays time best is to focus on train then the class, like choose Rajdhani 3A/2A over other cheap a*s train's 1AC. Yep i did both ,the message said my problem is closed automatically Vande bharat trains are currently good If only there was less corruption and the money allocated is used correctly we would be on a different level. Corrupt politicians are the root cause of everything imo Bathroom about the same as British railways then Should have booked a better train bro. Good bot Wow! That looks like they raised it and closed it at the same instant! I have seen this before as well. If you raise a complaint to have the compartment cleaned, it gets closed first and the cleaning process may or may not happen later. I've resorted to only taking the Rajdhani's, Vande Bharat etc now, only for a leisure trip, not more than once a year (was a train lover once!). Though not everybody can choose those trains as they run only on specific routes. oh good as long as no shit smell..... Because most Indians have little sense of civic duty. We boast about being a community-focused country, but frankly we don't care what happens to others as long as we get what we want. Even the platforms reek of dried urine. platform is now mandir ki samne wali sadak So, prison. Got it This looks like the first or second class.. It's apple and oranges, but fwiw- my travels in big Chinese cities was a lot less confronting than my travels in Indian cities, when it came to hygiene. That being said- Indians get paid less and the caste/class culture is painfully obvious. Flight washrooms are also quite bad these days. I’ve seen seats left with pee on them yuck and I don’t use them at all now. Also. What’s with people farting in flights so much like the smell just stays 😭😭😭😭 People don’t care for basic hygiene Most pleasant travel with Indian raiways Train toilets are like that in many countries. Had the unfortunate experience of seeing unflushed toilets in Spain and Germany. And it was not a one-time occurrence. Couldn't agree more. What's worse is when you're awaiting a fast train and a outstation train flies through. The stench of urine permeates the air. >General population doesn’t even find being filthy and living inside filth as a problem at all. This 👆👆👆 and it'll stay this way for the fairly foreseeable future. True, faced it as well. But then the hell atmost lasts for 3 -4 hours at best compared to suffering for a day or two🥲 I recently travelled in the mumbai to delhi rajdhani and i expected an experience like this but mine was quite good! The toilet was much better, the coach was clean and my fellow passengers were quite friendly and helpful! I was in 3AC and i had the last coach before the engine, which could be a reason for the toilet to be much better as only our compartment had access to it. Really unfortunate to hear about your experience. Indians see a few WhatsApp forwards with 3D concept photos of trains and automatically think all trains are now upgraded like those in the photos. How does someone break the toilet seat cover? How would someone manage to do that? Is that because someone was trying to steal it but didn't manage to break it entirely? Or was it because the cleaner must have broken it while doing their duties? Could be worse tbqh Platform is the old Sulabh. But saar we are superpower vishwaguru I think OP expected a better experience because that's what we've been hearing about on WhatsApp and from the media. That railways now are 100x better than before 2014 I guess it depends on your luck , . I've travelled in sleeper coaches , and people with no tickets sit near the door ,. Aur jitne log train mai rehte hai , sab gandagi karke rakhte hai . Some times railway staff comes to clean , sometimes not , also I remember going to the toilet in train , . Water wasn't coming from the tap. Had to take water from the bag to clean my hands The OP should have travelled in Vande Bharat as it's clearly the most advertised one.. Don't complain cars are bad if you choose the shitty one.. So expecting basic cleanliness is “Western Standard” Now. Great. Ammonia Upper and middle class Indians love cleanliness and hygiene but are used to having someone else clean up behind them. The culture of having servants do all the menial work is fully ingrained, and many feel that it's not their job to clean up after themselves. Contact Have seen that only in north , southern trains are pretty neat No offence but I lived in Nanded for 4 years those were most disgusting 4 years of my life I hate trains in India. Well, public transportation, really. It’s especially hard hitting when you lose a chunk of your money to pay taxes that you don’t get any benefit out of. ☹️ Wah Indian Railways Try Romanian Railways as your next challenge by experiencing indian Railways in an EU country Indian Railways had to chain toilet mugs you think people are ready for access cards Secondly everyone's just bashing Railways but the days of railway staff serving in train are long gone now in almost every train the cleaning and distribution part has been outsourced. true that the same people smh become extremely clean once they go abroad. the fear of fines makes them care a lot about keeping their surroundings clean lol Great bot I got in a restaurant that was Indian railways coach themed. The smell automatically came to me and I couldn't eat from that place! What more can you expect? Yes we are in being unhygienic. That's when you actually get the ticket in tatkal Are you kidding they are same! Annaa I live in Kerala, I always book flights to travel > So overall , I don't recommend anyone to use indian railways Which other railway service exists in India? Not all cities/ towns have airports. Desh aage badh rha iss logic se I traveled by IRCTC 1ac about a month ago. The train was Lucknow to Chandigarh. It was pretty fine. It wasn't very clean, there was an empty cup in the coupe and the cleaner came by and took it out. The toilets were meh but I expect that from train toilets. The experience was better than traveling in second ac where the toilets were really pretty bad by the second day morning. If you're traveling by Indian railways you get some big advantages like the space and plug points and just the nostalgia value of trains. I hate airplanes for how cramped they are, I feel it's worse than buses sometimes. So I'm willing to put up with the icky toilet situation (I always use the Indian one, less awful that way) and a bit of griminess. I wouldn't sit on that bog if payed me 🤢 > bog if *paid* me 🤢 FTFY. Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in: * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.* * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.* Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment. *Beep, boop, I'm a bot* one day in future, ppl will remember this and say \"yaad hau jab trains kitne gandhi ..\" /*woke up to reality*/ Lol. This is a zoke! I corrected it 🖕 I visited nanded for the Gurudwara ( i live in Ahmedabad Which train was this? 22723 Bruh. First time? I remember a huge pile of shit in a western toilet on the way to Goa. Never took a train again. Vande bharat is the new ac Aage Kua Hai shinkansen was invented in ancient india btw > I mean really I understand it is hard to maintain cleanliness when there are lakhs of passengers aboard the train daily. Japan carries 3x as much train passengers as india and they manage to keep it clean just fine 😂 Except a few rajdhanis none of the trains are upto the mark I hope Lego company never reads this. They'll puke immediately. Oh Boy I travelled first time in train that too in 3AC & all I experienced is how to fill FIR form for robbery . Disgusting that they still using old trains without door lock system, no cctv. Even 3AC is not safe nowadays ! Same thing happened with me. Travelling in 1st AC with family after about 10 years. It was pathetic. I raised a complain on X and tagged the Indian railways seva and our hon. Railway minister. Got the bathroom cleaned. (Atleast to be a bit usable). The other problem no one is highlighting is people who shit and don't flush. I hate both IR & our unhygienic citizens equally. Recently someone had posted about this issue and I got to know how a lot of us(Indians) don't know how to shit in toilets. 🫣 I cancel 70% of my trip plans because I realize I have to travel with Indian railways and I don't even have other options available. He's not talking about Bapu Gandhi = गंधी = dirty I dont think that we have a choice here. People who prioritise quality, will choose air ways. But there are exceptions. One is that there are no airways in the to and fro destinations. Another people isnt comfortable with airways i.e sickness by travelling on airways. So people have to choose trains as they cover lot of places with comfortable sleeping. They can take that their advantage and wont care for quality you pay for. Railways arent manage properly. We cant just satisfy the sheer number of our population. Management is just not upto the mark. It's literally FIRST AC...how is it the shitty option? Honestly, it's not a problem with maintenance or railway corporation for the most part, it's the people who use it, and treat it like they won't be using another train again. Personally whenever I've travelled, I make sure to clean the place where I slept, flush the toilet after using it and fold the bedsheets and blankets which I'm offered. Also I treat the place with respect. People can only expect good things if they start treating them accordingly. Are we putting ourselves in trouble here? Right which is why I said it isn't something impossible to do. If we can't get good service even in 1st class then .. i have never travelled in 1srt Ac thought 💭 it would be nice It’s not a IRCTC problem but a people problem. i am now unable to get the phrase \"poop jumpscare\" out of my brain I think I need to travel long-distance on IR again to experience this \"tangent\" smell Looks a lot better than most of my experience Dont keep quiet in such situations. Speak to the parent in a \"nice\" way People will be like “so what if they have increased the fares ridiculously, services have improved so much, you’ll have to pay if you need India to hole in the sky”. Bs. I have been saying for years there's no fucking difference between 1st Ac and 3rd Ac.. I'd rather go sitting and save money rant about AC first class? lol. just go and have a walk around 3AC or sleeper. Looks like Australian jail theres no time to clean/maintain thats the problem. Even VB trains have around 1hr on the platform and they head back to origin city. How did you know that it was controlled by southern railways.is there any link to check which train is controlled by which division?? I believe you got lucky there. I've seen much worse toilets. Anyways it's the people who are to blame in these situations. I really feel for the people who have to clean them. 320kmph bullock carts or something? I either use Road ( personal vehicle) or travel by air. But not indian railways. No matter how long or near journey is. And never understand their booking system after having bad experience. Like seat didn't get confirmed and all.. even tried didn't knew how to book vande Bharat i thought we can travel directly. Since the travel distance was less ( between Pune to Mumbai ) and just to get experience even though timing was so odd... But they had whole different system for current booking. Which we wasn't unaware. These trains have always been like this even before vande Bharat, it is what it is Agreed - but most times it is not as bad as the OP faced, especially when it is 1st AC. I like to travel by train but I don't travel due to the situation in toilets. It's literally printed on the coach \"NR\" is northern railway and \"SR\" is southern railway Aapko hui asuvidha ke liye aapko khed hai Okk but how will I know before boarding a train??like without seeing the train how should I decide to choose trains Well if you're choosing which train to travel with then do your own research, all it takes is a Google search, atleast that's what I do I've not had any problems with southern railways though, I travel with TN express regularly. Not only do they clean the floor every few hours, the bathroom is also okay TN express goes patna to coimbatore Lol what? It goes from Chennai to Delhi, do you know much about railways my guy? Yeah I came by this train two days ago I was thinking of ernakulam express Idk about that, TN express touches neither Patna nor Coimbatore Yes, I travel in tamil nadu express it is very clean and neat. I love trains. But the toilets in Indian Railways are the only reason why I stopped going long distance in trains. I have never seen a toilet in these trains where I could even consider sitting. So I have to hold it in during the entire journey. I'll pay for the plane ticket thank you. Phir to hume speed bhadani chaiye 😂 kaam se kaam aar ya paar to ho Bhai yahan aasuvihda se ched bada ho gaya hai aaur aap kedh vyaqt kar rahe ho See so your problem was resolved, you just didn't know it 😂.. its all a matter of perspective.. Normally you check the origin station of each train route. This helps to initially identify them. Secondly, you can always check reviews on trip advisor on that express you wish to travel or travel bloggers for trains specifically. This is what I did. Reality of Indian railways unlike positive bloggers of youtube.insta I had to travel to Malkapur from Mumbai a few times. I had to use the Vidarbha Express. The train was spotless and super clean. Not all trains are the same. Long distance trains usually get dirtier because of the long time they spend being occupied by humans. If you are rich enough to travel in 1 tier AC, why do you travel in 1 tier AC? Lekin raaste pe to speed camera hai.. Aaj raat ki hi train hai bro vo bhi 3AC🥲 Shinkansen's average delay is measured in _seconds_ Enough said. Which train are you talking about? Hi I recently travelled from Jaipur to Mumbai in first class toom held my pee and didn't eat ANYTHING during the journey I HATE it when my relatives say -\"itne kya nakhrein , hum toh sleeper class mein bhi chale jaaye\" The whole train situation is so messy . HATE HATE x42948 It To Mumbai* Just to avoid using the washroom Even if improvements are made and people come and clean from time to time. They still gonna make it dirty. It's public responsibility to keep it clean but it can't be changed for a century or two Ah yes don't forget to shit before boarding and hope you don't need to go in there.. you have money so you can opt for another ways of travel but millions of people who doesn't have money to travel in ac category travel in general class. they don't have choice. two reasons are main for this situation of railway 1- population 2- mentality of people they don't care what will happen of the train once they complete there journey. middle class people are at worse condition because they can't travel in ac and they are not same like mazdoors bit they have to travel with them. Sleeper is the new Chalu(General) and Chalu(General) has become Deen Dayalu and no one talks about both of them. Lucky you had a toilet. I had a hole. FYI It's true for Indian railways too. >!10 hours delay = 36k seconds delay!< Delay is western culture We use flock timing to lessen delay Logo kya hai Chaiwale ko vote denge Have you used porta potty in US ? Its as disgusting as our Indian public toilets . Kabhi general me chadh ke dekh fatt ke 4 ho jayegi Or khana to kha mat lena galti se itna ghatiya khan kahi nahi milta Looks cleaner than what I’ve ever seen. damn! u want to see me in jail that badly?? why? what did i do to u? Which Gandhi ? India shining guys ! Also means bad smell. Gandh. Bad smell Still people also shower in this Should have been more careful in your choice Including critics like you Until and unless we teach civic sense to our fellow Indians nothing's gonna solve! No worries. We’re here to fun the defeciet budgets Paid the guard at the entry door Once it will have one (or one in the vicinity) you won't post these threads either. Not saying that's a good thing, but it is what it is. No. Just helping the railways to control the losses Maybe the tickets will also be flavoured with the same smell and help us to get used to the gandh meh😂 apparently the sense of smell tends to disappear after one spends more than an hour in there😂 Back in the late 90s , early 00s 2nd AC was awesome! Bro, not the washroom picture Wonder how you guys will react after seeing NYC subway station 😂 Update: curly tales made an article on this lmao that’s so disgusting but im not surprised 😂😂😂 And Modi keeps adding Vande Bharats without resolving issues for everyday citizens just ask yourself how bad the situation would be general or sleeper that they had came to shit here Entha train bro? 🤣 Lol I thought the same. Is it ac 1 tier or two tier? Put nsfw 1 Tangent to which Circle? No vroo in south people dont pee in train it just vaporises into ether from their bladder I recently travelled after ~10 years, but I did see quite some improvements. Went from Mumbai to Surat in Vande Bharat and returned in Tejas express. Both were comparatively cleaner and even the platforms in Mumbai and Gujarat was also way cleaner than what I remember from 10 years ago. The toilet had hand jets as well. The servers were nice as well. So it has two beds just like ac 2? Unfortunately yes ! You said you don't recommend it, like we use the Indian railway for some experience, we don't have a choice bud Do din ruk bhai india hai, speed camera chori ho jayega 😂 Dear esteemed reditor, Enlighten me how to shit in toilets I had also travelled from Nanded to Mumbai earlier this year in 1st class AC and the tickets were in no way cheap. It was a horrible experience. - There were multiple cockroaches in the compartment as well as the bathrooms - the bedsheets and pillow covers had multiple stains on them - Bathrooms as shown in the picture. - the smell The experience scarred me for life. This really needs to be highlighted and facilities need to be improved. Piss and grease There's nothing we can do Phenyle ka spelling nai pata Tangent aur pungent mai fark nai pata But Indian Railways pe complaint karne social media pe zaroor utarna hai Welcome to Indian Railways! This is first AC?? Man I’m so glad I saw this before my next trip to India Yep The last time I travelled by Indian railways (sometime in 2008), I got head lice. Never travelled by Indian trains again. I had no idea that they don’t wash the bedsheets, blankets etc after every use. No sleeping, shitting, or showering. Got it. Han spelling pta hoga toh train ka condition theek ho jaega 🤓 > ut very little actual ground force for coach maintenance, In that other thread about cleanliness some users had commented that it was because of casteism. Could it be that people who seek employment in drover with Railways will do any thing but cleaning bathrooms as that is associated with lower castes? Holy sheet. Last time I travelled on Indian railways was 2009. & one time I went by non-AC in 2003 it was still decent. But even back then I never ever used the western toilets, except to urinate standing up Not restricted to trains, but also the airplanes. :) Oh you don't know? Our railways is fixed now, everything is neat and clean. Didn't you see the reels? /s > For every coach and train, not just 1st class, there should be enough ground force with reasonable pay to maintain hygiene and cleanliness at least in the bathrooms. What should be the pay to clean public bathrooms though? How do you get over the cultural casteist stigma of only lower castes cleaning toilets and the whole nightsoil carrier things which was only outlawed a decade or so ago. And raise the voice on the kids like older aunt/uncle too to discipline them? Forget the planes, how did you navigate the bathrooms when you were out and about and had to pee/poop in public or restaurants? If you have to travel outside of vande , rajdhani or shatabdi, best to avoid bathroom >People don’t care for basic hygiene Could this be something that they need to be taught through public awareness campaigns? Maybe the airlines themselves could do it to teach how air travel works i.e. farting where there is no air ventilation or to use bathrooms before the flight as much as possible etc etc. Other than your own private plane with the private bathrooms, how will you travel without need to use a public bathrooms which are not nasty? Speed camera chori ho gaya. Gari start. No , the housekeeping staff do their job Considering the people who use this authorities are not to blame fully. Are you serious? Just think about the two countries population and how popular trains are as a medium of transport in India Oh the stench comes from the seats if you're closed and somebody just opens the doors 😭 Lmfao Ngl the toilet looks way better than the train toilets in my country, I thought it would be way worse in india everyone I talk do warns me about the trains when I say I wanna live/visit there It's a coupe When I visited Kerala, basically I was peeing outside (thankfully, didnt need to use for #2). In Hyd, the restaurants seemed better honestly. But, yes, I wonder how women manage the god awful restrooms over there. Feel sorry for the situation. I watched Darjeeling limited buddy, it didn’t look like this! 3AC is the new Sleeper coach OP travelling a train in a train which goes to North India and expecting cleanliness a toilet right next to General compartment 🫣☠️ Which one is it ? I first thought that that was a jail cell lmao That's the reason I prefer to fight over train What is that? Is it bad that this is better than I expected? You're worried about hygiene which can be seen or sniffed, but what can't be seen are overworked and understaffed loco pilots. You have a situation today where the government has repackaged existing services to Vande Bharat but train speed and food quality is the same or worse than Rajdhani. Yesterday a loco pilot left his train full of passengers mid-way and head home as he had already shooted above his shift time. This is a recurring issue that loco pilots are facing as the government is not hiring new pilots. I also feel disgusted travelling in Indian railway so I do a somewhat water fast … take sometimes tea , puff rice to avoid using toilets more often. However I never travelled in 1st class but hoping to get better services there but it seems like all tiers are same … No one needs bullet trains or fancy airport-like stations. Just maintain what you have got. Gaadi bhi chori ho gayi! Are you sure this isn't a train from mad max? Man 1st ac is so bad lol I can literally hear the statement in that voice Don't worry man, even flights are as disgusting as Indian Railways now-a-days. Especially the quality of Air India post acquisition has been degrading day by day. Payed bot > *Paid* bot FTFY. Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in: * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.* * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.* Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment. *Beep, boop, I'm a bot* Doesnt serve as an excuse to act like animals whenever we get the opportunity first time? Please tag these NSFW. I completely agree with you here mate, these new gen parents really suck at teaching kids basic civil manners. I have lived in Japan for 2 years and let me tell you one thing mate, people there are civil and they have basic etiquettes. Its dog eats dog world here in India. Majority of our population does not respect public space. It’s in our culture, unfortunately. We just don’t care. Even railway staff who are tasked with cleaning probably don’t care because it’s just a job to them. Not only do they, just like everyone else, care about public spaces and keeping things neat and tidy, but they also do not have any additional incentives to go the extra mile and do an amazing job cleaning. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone. It's one thing to blame the management for their poor maintenance, but it's weird you have to shift the blame to non-ac people. \"Is it the fault of our messed up railways that don't clean or maintain our cars properly, no, it must be those lesser people from general cars\" Are faq these liars, shutya bnajar jeete rehte h ye log.. kutto govt Consumer and management: both has the same mindset called DGAF. Consumers don’t keep it clean, management doesn’t bother to clean. Problem is on both sides yes. south is different saar Lower caste people always make excuses to be lazy. What about south imdian How about making toilet doors which do not unlock unless you flush the toilet? Smells quite tangent Smell of piss + ammonia = avg train experience Not recommend to use indian railways. As if, dusra koi railway option hai? Should’ve given a Trigger Warning before the second picture 🤢 A Porta potty is like the lowest of the low lol. Even for those it’s not always disgusting I think it should be an issue with how they process the tickets. Like when the agent assign the issue to someone else on the ground, they consider it as resolved. This shouldn’t be the case but thats as far as we have come in tech and efficiency. India has 8,500 million passengers carried in rail transport per year Japan has 24,500 million passengers carried in rail transport per year Sulabh is the old railway track what ? people shower in the toilet stall ? This is the most clean experience i had seen so far haha jk Jokes aside, You were just unlucky. Most are \" decently \" clean. Not counting general/sleeper. Even choosing 3rd AC over sleeper makes a lot of difference in term of cleanliness. The issue with Indian trains are, that the staff are badly selected and Indian education gives more priority to there propoganda than teaching students moral values and how to keep their surroundings clean. All we get to learn is how government announced \"Clean india program\" I was about to ask why I could smell pee and fenyl at the same time suddenly If you ever have to visit any public hospital: same experience. I feel that south India uses less trains. I have not taken a train ride for years but i see most people in south prefer to use a bus, most destinations are covered in 12 hours and service is generally very good. Railway Police needs to be beefed up at all stations. Any person without ticket should be deboarded and police should help in this Wow …. My standards are pretty low , for train all this looks pretty clean . Well the restaurant had food reviews. I just couldn't get the smell out of my head. God. Op were u born with a silver spoon up ur ass? Can uu smell the toilet in that picture I can't. Travelled by train only twice since COVID. The toilets were clean in those trains. I could smell fragrance as well. Vande vande vande bharat Aap recommend nahi karte?? Bhai agar kisiko option Mila plane aur train ke beech Mai wo plane ko hi choose karte. Chale aye kothe bangle Wale apna gyaan Dene ke liye. Agree on the efficiency front. But Tech - that bends to your will/determination. Ac is new sleeper, sleeper is new general and general is pigsty. How much tax do you pay? Indian railways running app ,go downloaded that app report this thing on that app instead upload in reddit next time just get a general (unreserved) ticket to complete your experience, _You regret your inconvenience_ During my school trips whenever train travel was there I used to go all the way to first class and use the toilets. Ceramic toilet and sink with a fan on top lol. They charge so heavily but they don’t even provide basic amenities Washrooms are never clean Good morning Alot I havent traveled in a train in years… i love traveling a lot n it wd have been easier if i cd travel in trains.. but ughh trains make me gag.. they visibly look dirty .. flights maybe dirty bt mostly u cant tell…i have legit cried once cz a family kf cockroaches once accompanied me throughout my 12 hour ride n there was no escaping them.. ( cd have been arnd 15-20 of them)… i honestly shiver when i think about it.. Naah i ll pay for the flight or not travel bt i think i have given up on trains for now.. shankh-hans,-yaan was the original name Not to shit on your experience, but I thought it looked “good enough” (not 5 * , but depends on how much you paid for it). Of course, my kids grew up very differently so maybe they might share your opinions - just us old geysers rejoice at the sight of a “working toilet” , or a berth sans 3 people occupying what your ticket claims you have sole right to. Bro is like 50 years late Stick to the domestic airlines. They save you time and also save you from getting gonorrhea, and syphilis in railway toilets. Probably better for mental health too 😂 Flight is the new 2AC Lmao had a good chuckle reading this. The delusions of people right? Just for asking for basic cleanliness that too? Wow. OP is surely a delusional guy! /s in case it doesnt get through your head Last week I travelled from Delhi to Mumbai in Tejas Rajdhani in 2A. Ticket 4,250 ki padi aur kuch khaas nhi tha Rajdhani me. Paise dube. Koi aur random express ka 2A ticket 2-3k me ajata aur coach condition shayad aur acche hote. Oh my..when I visit India in April, I think my family is taking a train to Kashmir..if it’s like this it’s gonna be a wild ride 💀 I haven’t used a rail in India as an Indian in 30 years. Modi ji loves to sell his India is shining propaganda. But gawar log to gawar he rehega i can smell this picture This train 22723 is managed by South Central Railway division, anyways thankyou I learnt something new today. Yep outside the entrace of taj mahal there were people showering in the washroom. Also for some unknown reason you need to pay 10 rupees just to use the toilet. Damn time to ban japan for taking indian idea Humsafar congress k train mai board kiye ho. wande bharat mai board karo. your mistake, and you are anti national. /s This please. To be honest I find stations and station tracks to be much cleaner and better maintained than before. but this is only after seeing a few junctions i have been frequenting since a decade... I am khed Paid The quality of work depends on the person who is doing the work at the ground level. Even if orders are passed from above from the station of origin, who will make sure that it stays that way. It's the sweeper/ cleaner who has to understand the importance of cleaning, and they don't. Most of the Indians don't value cleanliness. I was traveling to Agra once, the sweeper cleaned the entire 1st AC only to throw everything outside the gate. I told him not to, but he said \"kya fark padta hai itne se kachre se\" and did it anyway. So till they don't understand, us the people don't understand, it's gonna be the same. Not to kids but definitely has to speak up to the parents who are least bothered about their kid's wild behaviour let alone discipline them. I feel it's more to do with management. Railways are known for their mediocre and lazy approach in many places although they maybe are trying to improve. Here they need proper administration of staff on ground level. What happens is that mostly the staff will clean once when train is at the source station and then just leave it for the rest of the journey. Even when passengers are aboard, if managed rightly, a team of 2 for every 2 coaches can easily clean the bathrooms once in every 2-3 hours maybe even 4. Passengers can wait 10-15 mins whike they clean. This will only happen if the staff on the train is trained or held liable in doing so which will come to happen if their upper authority makes it a firm part of the job role. I’ve never traveled in any train except of Mumbai local and this comment is my final sign to never do so Just get a flight at that point how much more expensive can it really be like a a few thousand rupees Istg same i never had to travel in trains we only took flights and even locally i always traveled in either my own car or autos I only first started travelling on Mumbai local when I was in Fyjc Kc college Same it’s absolutely disgusting idk how people even travel that way I would rather just stay at home than travel in a train like it’s ewww Saying that when I've had a vindaloo curry my bog looks even worse than that 😁 Nothing can ever make me travel in a train like just get a flight man Even though British trains are really bad it's at least better than Indian trains I’ve traveled across Europe in trains like that’s fine but within India I have never and don’t plan to ever either the only trains I do travel is Mumbai local that too first class Never been to India but I have travelled by train in Japan and they're amazing Yeah flights is good but check-ins & security ruins the whole experience. I mean 2 hrs before the flight and restrictions on what to carry and whatnot is an exhausting task. That too gets avoided if you travel Buisniss but I’m sure economy isn’t as bad as trains it’s so much better Happens when uncivilized are rich. Now a days its going more towards cleanliness. Earlier it was not that clean."
