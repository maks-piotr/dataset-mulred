    "selftext": " \n\nInfinix laptop by Seller: BUZZINDIA, Amount Paid Rs. 25039  \nOrder was delivered on Sun, Oct 15, Open Box delivery was declined.  \nI picked up the item and found that Box had a broken HP laptop in the infinix Box.  \nI  raised a return request which took 3 days for the team to verify and  later the courier guys refused to pickup the package stating that it is  different then the ordered.  \nI had to move to my home due to hostel  getting close so called the customer care and asked to change the pickup  address, I was advised on the call to cancel the current return request  and raise a new one. I cancelled the request which took 3 days to  process and after that I was not given a option to raise a return  request. I called the customer care again and explained the situation  and got the option for replacement instead of return and I accepted it.  \nReturn was raised however, it got closed in 24 hours stating that product received was intact.  \nI  called again and got another Return created which got closed with same  message and my account has been blocked now. I have no way to contact  them, they are replying with standard lines in twitter.\n\nI  spoke to bank for charge back, they have raised the request but  informed that it will take 120 days to investigate. Feeling helpless.",
