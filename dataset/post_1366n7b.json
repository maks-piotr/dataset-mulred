        "I know ranting about parents is common in this sub and it might frustrate some people. If you don't want to see another rant, please scroll down, look for another post that interests you and stop hate commenting. It's really common for people to vent on the internet and feel a bit validated. Looking at how emotionally suppressed our society and culture is, it's a good first step to let the people vent out. In other words, it's none of your business. If you can't offer empathy, don't hate. Similar to how you treat beggars on the street. You can only do so much. It sucks. But you still carry on."
