It's criminal negligence on all ends. \n\nThat too with minimal bail money or consequences. Regardless of the outrage. \n\nA 300 word essay is worth 2 lives? What a joke.\n\nPizza and burger were definitely fed to influence the alcohol/drug test. The guy hopped two restaurants in one night and was still hungry? I don't buy it. They could have done even better should have given them garlands and done a road parade and salutation of some form.\n\nI know I am being sarcastic on serious topic.

        "It's always been like that since the beginning, rich people always get away with everything, laws are designed and applicable to the general public only. Due to the Internet, we are getting aware of this more now. The hard truth is that this will never change. Just give it some days, and this car accident stuff will be forgotten by all and media will have some other stuff to play with. This kid will shift abroad and would live happily while the victims would suffer for their entire lives. The government or authorities don't care much about the general public (except during the election). We have 1.4 billion of these, and even if half of it get wiped out, that won't matter much to them. Justice is an expensive commodity that only rich and influential can afford.",
        "Such poor legal literacy and 0 knowledge of ground situations leads to people making dumbass comments. Some things to take note of :\n\n1. 1st stage of Bail is within 24 hours, almost everyone gets bail within this time.\n1. Bail is a right of everyone if the offence is bailable and is ready to furnish bail. Bail is not equal to acquittal and is rejected in pretty rare cases.\n2. Now a days people who cannot afford an advocate are provided one at the expense of the government at this stage as neither the government nor the courts want overcrowding of prisons. Even the requirement of surety is forgone in favor of not sending them to prison.\n3. Ofcourse the world is favourable to the rich, you have to be stupidly naive to think that economic status has no relevance in legal system. Rich people can afford better lawyers which makes all the difference.\n4. India is a massive country where information management is quite poor so rarely it does happen that a person stays in jail even if he can avail the benefit of the law to get out which would never happen with someone rich.",
        "I guess these rich brats carry licence to kill in these cars. If you hit someone resulting in death due to negligence/inebriated/rash driving etc, the fine should be 5Cr+ seizing the accident car+block driving for 5 years.",

        "This is happening every day in our country, everyone knows of a case in their city. The Pune case came to light only because the victims were techies and their relatives were comparatively educated and contacted the media. In my own city a woman had mowed down someone with her car and before the police could do anything she was sent out of India and a settlement was reached with the victims. This is something everyone in my city knows but no one cares. People think that because the settlement is made with victims it's all okay, they forget that next time it may be themselves who are killed because of these drivers who keep on driving their expensive cars.",

        "It's always been the case. These rich brats have been doing it. Similar to rape cases some of the cases just comes to our attention. It's a sad reality of our world, nothing has changed from the times of monarchy and colonialism, rich will always walk away scot free.",
        "Is there some sort of premium court kachahari processing that is included when you buy cars like Porche, Mercedes that I'm not aware of. Now these brands being super expensive makes sense...",
        "Our politicians are certified criminals. Genocide, extortion, and encounter killings is what got them to the top. If that's what represents our country at the highest level, is it any surprise to anyone that rich people can mow people down on the roads without any consequences? I think it's very much a continuity of the pattern. \n\nI don't know how a society can collectively change their mindset and outlook, and likely this will take decades, but we have a long way to go. People, especially the 15- 50 years age group, have to think that enough is enough. No one else is going to save us. \n\nThis applies right from the way we behave as a civil society to how we elect our politicians and what we demand out of them.",

        "His family also has connections with underworld",
        "This is sad. But i guess this is where the power of social media comes in. Juvenile Justice Board reversed the decision, cancelled bail for the kid. The father and the bar owner have been arrested. I guess thatâ€™s the one thing that works in this country. If even a fraction of us makes noise for the right cause things can change",

It may take time but they will always get away. Rules for thee, not for me That's a very poor argument imo The guy already can't drive until he's 25. \"Ooh but he's \"free\"\" Well, this is the country in which an Aston Martin once crashed into two cars, magically upgrading one from a Hyundai Elantra into a Skoda Superb and an old Audi A6 into a newer Audi A6. The guy couldn't drink until he's 18 and look what happened. He drank! no matter what you say but one thing is for sure the system only favors the rich whether it is police,law and order,etc you can see this how police treats a poor and a rich We all need to be angry, we all need to show them what happens when you mess with the public, when you forget your place and act like gods on earth. We need to eat the rich, we need to get our justice. It's sarcasm... Like they are destroying pubs and talking about putting restrictions to Pune's night life. So? There's consequences. OMG, can't drive till 25, how will be survive. Thoughts and prayers with the kid who \"only\" killed 2 people and now poor fellow can't even drive a luxury car his dad gifted him till he's 25 Disgusting and vile Do anyone name of the 17 year old and his father? Makes sense, Merc one can give less money as compared to Porsche one The case will be dragged on while he is free in bail and later the case will be pushed aside while he lives freely whereas the victim's family is bothered. The so called trial will be pushed aside quietly after sometime when social media outrage is gone Jus$tice ha$ been $erved. Our $y$tem is flawle$$. I wonder how much it is for Ferrari? The pune boy bullied former minister of Maharashtraâ€™s son which forced that boy to transfer schools and when the porsche accident happened the boy told everyone that stop beating me and tell me how much money you want ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ I am so shocked ppl like this exists. And imagine the influence his family has that he can bully a ministerâ€™s son and get away with it Money talks.. Why did you even come to jail. E-bail! Indian police will take you straight to UK, Germany etc. This is very old news and it became an issue in Nagpur. The bloody lady apparently left the country It did become a big deal in Nagpur. This story was suppressed so quickly ..the deceased's mother was a kidney patient and he had gone to buy her medicines in his Activa. The drunk woman was coming home from partying when she hit the Activa. , The speed with which the matter was suprresed was alarming. Car culture should be abolished. Luxury cars should be banned in India, compelling everyone to use public transport. If public transport can be utilized as a vote bank tactic, why not encourage capitalists to use it as well? And they should but many more systematic changes are needed. Individual enforcement can only go so far, it won't make a difference at scale. Don't know bro I have seen just too many instances of the rich guy getting a free out of jail card too many times. Specially in car accidents, let's not call it accidents any more - you don't give a fast car to a minor in a public road and call it an accident. It's criminal negligence on all ends. That too with minimal bail money or consequences. Regardless of the outrage. A 300 word essay is worth 2 lives? What a joke. Pizza and burger were definitely fed to influence the alcohol/drug test. The guy hopped two restaurants in one night and was still hungry? I don't buy it. They could have done even better should have given them garlands and done a road parade and salutation of some form. I know I am being sarcastic on serious topic. But that's how ridiculous things are. Fast cars give fast justice. Atleast for the one driving it. It's always been like that since the beginning, rich people always get away with everything, laws are designed and applicable to the general public only. Due to the Internet, we are getting aware of this more now. The hard truth is that this will never change. Just give it some days, and this car accident stuff will be forgotten by all and media will have some other stuff to play with. This kid will shift abroad and would live happily while the victims would suffer for their entire lives. The government or authorities don't care much about the general public (except during the election). We have 1.4 billion of these, and even if half of it get wiped out, that won't matter much to them. Justice is an expensive commodity that only rich and influential can afford. Such poor legal literacy and 0 knowledge of ground situations leads to people making dumbass comments. Some things to take note of : 1. 1st stage of Bail is within 24 hours, almost everyone gets bail within this time. 1. Bail is a right of everyone if the offence is bailable and is ready to furnish bail. Bail is not equal to acquittal and is rejected in pretty rare cases. 2. Now a days people who cannot afford an advocate are provided one at the expense of the government at this stage as neither the government nor the courts want overcrowding of prisons. Even the requirement of surety is forgone in favor of not sending them to prison. 3. Ofcourse the world is favourable to the rich, you have to be stupidly naive to think that economic status has no relevance in legal system. Rich people can afford better lawyers which makes all the difference. 4. India is a massive country where information management is quite poor so rarely it does happen that a person stays in jail even if he can avail the benefit of the law to get out which would never happen with someone rich. I guess these rich brats carry licence to kill in these cars. If you hit someone resulting in death due to negligence/inebriated/rash driving etc, the fine should be 5Cr+ seizing the accident car+block driving for 5 years. Country and the courtâ€™s decision making being worse day by day its better than these murderers roaming free Too much population. Once again Too Fkin Much. And we all know which religion is to blame. Asli ID se aa Vedant But I thought you guys were against people sitting 10 years in jail for their trials? This is happening every day in our country, everyone knows of a case in their city. The Pune case came to light only because the victims were techies and their relatives were comparatively educated and contacted the media. In my own city a woman had mowed down someone with her car and before the police could do anything she was sent out of India and a settlement was reached with the victims. This is something everyone in my city knows but no one cares. People think that because the settlement is made with victims it's all okay, they forget that next time it may be themselves who are killed because of these drivers who keep on driving their expensive cars. Damn, Vedant Agarwal just found his soulmate Affects of BJP existing! ðŸ˜‚ Not just that. Bro was served biryani and pizza in prison. Takes a pure psycho mindset to be able to eat peacefully after having taken 2 lives It's always been the case. These rich brats have been doing it. Similar to rape cases some of the cases just comes to our attention. It's a sad reality of our world, nothing has changed from the times of monarchy and colonialism, rich will always walk away scot free. Is there some sort of premium court kachahari processing that is included when you buy cars like Porche, Mercedes that I'm not aware of. Now these brands being super expensive makes sense... Our politicians are certified criminals. Genocide, extortion, and encounter killings is what got them to the top. If that's what represents our country at the highest level, is it any surprise to anyone that rich people can mow people down on the roads without any consequences? I think it's very much a continuity of the pattern. I don't know how a society can collectively change their mindset and outlook, and likely this will take decades, but we have a long way to go. People, especially the 15- 50 years age group, have to think that enough is enough. No one else is going to save us. This applies right from the way we behave as a civil society to how we elect our politicians and what we demand out of them. Exactly as if the pub owners will be able to refuse a rich brat. Must have gotten a barrage of 'tula maithe ka ki mazha baba kon aahe' if they refused to serve him booze. It's an accident, not murder that's why they get bail. They don't kill or hurt intentionally. It's an accident, that's why vehicles got insurance. A former minister how rich is this dude family His family also has connections with underworld This is sad. But i guess this is where the power of social media comes in. Juvenile Justice Board reversed the decision, cancelled bail for the kid. The father and the bar owner have been arrested. I guess thatâ€™s the one thing that works in this country. If even a fraction of us makes noise for the right cause things can change rich fuckin the poor. common public getting robbed by govt as always. you fed up with the shitty politics and poor quality of life. just india things.. mehh!ðŸ˜‚ They should refuse. Record him on camera whatever he says That will end badly for them only. Just read his grandfather (who vouched for him in juvenile justice board) has an attempt to murder case going on. His grandfather hired chotta shakeel gang for killing a corporator . As if things ended good for them now. Diversion hai bhai. They will be back to normal once elections are done. not the first club in Pune which fell into trouble He will never face the consequences of his actions, he will be free with no repercussions. Now they made it more ez to get a DL by leaving everything to the private driving schools, driving schools can issue licenses themselves after June 1 >Diversion hai bhai Yeah. Even kids know this now. Frl... I myself planning to persuade studying in foreign country"
