        "I remember this issue in my old MNC, I remember the hardware person explaining that he did activate it, but when they change hardware (ram, hard disk etc) or a part of the pc. The license gets reset because I don't know how exactly it works but windows recognises it as a completely new pc due to hardware change.\n\nSomebody more knowledgeable can explain it better than me 😅",
        "lol, the managers there get newspaper subscriptions and add it to the company bill.\n\nThese guys are cheapskate's of different proportions...",

        "In 2012, my initial employer was L&T Infotech, and I believe I can provide some insights. When it comes to their spending habits, the answer is a resounding yes – they are quite frugal. As for the quality of hardware provided to employees, the answer is a definite no. The laptops they furnish are subpar, and obtaining administrative privileges is a protracted process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding compensation, when I started as a fresher in 2012, our monthly pay was around 21k, which was about 4-5k less than what companies like Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and Accenture were offering at that time. However, considering my career's modest progression at the time, and the fact that L&T Infotech offered me a job despite having a career below 60%, I considered it a reasonable deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've heard from some friends who have re-joined the company recently that they are now receiving much better pay. But from the perspective of a former software engineer, substandard hardware isone of the most demoralizing aspects of the experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo I regret working there? Not at all. It was at L&T Infotech that I got my first opportunity to work onsite within just 11 months of starting, which allowed me to save money and eventually pursue fitness training certification, leading to my current career as a fitness consultant in Amsterdam.",
        "Well you are working on the data of 1999 so that make sense lol",
        "Okay. I was working for Mindtree before it became LTI Mindtree. I have a lot of friends there who are in senior dev positions and some are even team leads. And all of them have said this to me.... Mindtree has gone down in every facet since the L&T take over. And the worst thing that has suffered is the corporate environment.",

        "Fuck Microsoft",
        ">Not activating dose not mean it’s pirated.\n\n They didn't activate on time. Or let it expire or didn't get enough licences. OP is smart enough to know that this isn't supposed to be happening. Laughing at him and providing vague responses just shows more about you than OP. \n\n>There are audits and checks.\n\nThis should have been caught ahead of time in a proper audit check. Just because there are some audits and checks doesn't mean they are good.  \n\n>You are just a fresher in corporate take patience to understand things\n\nA fresher who is highlighting these things is better than some slightly experienced  person laughing it off and calling for \"patience\" and what not.",

        "That is not how it works. If they can show proof that they have purchased 1000 licenses and have 1000 active machines, Microsoft doesn’t care if you activate them or not. Audit will go smoothly nonetheless.",
        "It looks like a training room, maybe that's why they didn't bother with the licence.",
        "Yes it's a training room. But I think a corporation as big as L&T ought to license all their pcs.",
        "Same goes with post office",
        "Not once did I call pirated, maybe you need to learn how to read the right way.",
        "It's been like this for 3 months, I find it hard to believe the licensing server is down for this long.",
        "Shit happens. I’ve had this message show up in my system for over 6 months. Did some digging around and found out about this whole licensing server thing and that it’s like the bottom most priority, cos they had enough evidence of procuring necessary licenses incase MS audited them.",
        "Tbh, that's true, but these pcs have 4gigs of ram and a 500gig hdd. Just booting up , starting the three kinds of monitoring software and vscode takes an excruciating 20 minutes.",
        "Schools and colleges only focus on how to develop apps not these small licensing thing.\nMost software engineers don't even know the basic parts of a PC and how they function. \nHeck I might even say that 99% of IT people can't even build a PC themselves. They only know the On/Off switch of a laptop.",
        "How fucking pathetic is that. So for a whole fucking decade a server stays shut down ?",
        "Licensing is validated at frequent intervals, not just during OS installation. So if the server went down yesterday and isn’t up yet, all machines reporting to that server will show this message.\n\nWhere did the decade thing even come from?",

        "Nobody should be paying for this shitty OS. Move to Linux",
        "I'm grateful that you inquired. Fitness has always been a passion of mine. Back in 2011, I was quite thin, but by 2012, I had transformed myself into an acceptable shape, weighing almost 74 kilograms with a significant amount of muscle. When the opportunity arose for me to take on an overseas assignment in Korea with the software company I joined in 2012, I recognized it as my chance to save money for my fitness certifications. At that time, I was earning $2,830 USD, and my monthly expenses ranged from $800 to $1,300 USD, so financially, I was in a good position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, I wasn't sure where to begin professionally. I started by joining a nearby gym near Samsung Suwon called Top Fitness for my regular training. There, I would encounter some national athletes and coaches who came for training very early in the morning. Over time, I managed to establish a rapport with them and sought their guidance on how to start a professional career in fitness. I enrolled in a CPT program at an affiliated institute and completed the Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) and Corrective Exercise Specialist (CES) certifications within a span of two years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpon returning to India after three years, I made the decision to leave software engineering behind and joined Gold's Gym as an assistant fitness trainer. During this time, I gained valuable experience and honed my skills, particularly while assisting an in-house trainer from David Lloyd Amsterdam during a 10-day personal training session at Radha Hometel in Bangalore. He extended an offer for me to work at David Lloyd in Amsterdam, and I eagerly accepted. This marked the beginning of my professional journey, and I've since expanded my network. I currently work at a different fitness chain and provide fitness consulting services for young athletes and mid-level corporate professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that my story may not be glamorous or cinematic, but all I can say is that I feel fortunate for the opportunities I've had. If you have any questions about certifications, the process, duration, or anything else, please feel free to ask.",
        "Mf what are you saying this is the most cinematic shit I’ve read on here in a long time! Job well done.",
        "Thank you, sir. I've been fortunate in many ways, with hard work playing a significant role, but I also attribute a substantial portion of my success to the divine blessings.\n\n Just so that you also know, I wasn't the only one on this kind of journey. A friend from the same company and batch is now working as a fitness consultant in New Zealand. He pursued a professional master's degree, and he served as my inspiration because I knew if it was the wrong path, he wouldn't have ventured down it.",
        "Haha that’s great to hear buddy. Unfortunately my journey to the gym is hard work enough for me. If you’ve got some cutting fat and gaining muscle simultaneously tips and tricks with a good PPL split, help out this gareeb.",
        "I don't get why big organizations don't use Linux universally. Some do,  but many don't, even though there are great options like Lubuntu, Mint,  and Debian for low-end PCs. Linux could solve the issue of slow boot and  shutdown times. Plus, LibreOffice is a solid alternative to Microsoft  Office. \n\nI'm genuinely curious why more organizations aren't adopting  these solutions. If anyone has insights, please share.",

        "Often it works the other way round. Legal often seek to assert licensing to remove liability.",
        "I'm really surprised that a huge company is pinching pennies like this",
        "If this is a temp setup used for trainings or labs (windows reinstalled every few months) then they usually keep these pcs on an isolated lan for security reasons. So they won't have access to the license server (although these pcs will usually be isolated from the Internet too).",

Im from the medical fraternity and doing the hard grind in a gulf country. I could only dream of taking a risk like you did. But, nice to see someone follow their passion.... Maybe 5  years down the line, I might look to do that once I move to India...",
        "Thank you for your kind words of appreciation. To provide you with a comprehensive understanding of why I was able to take this risk, let me outline the key factors:\n\n1. Both my parents were government employees, so they were financially independent, and I wasn't responsible for their financial well-being.\n\n2. I had a total work experience of four years when i quit , with nearly three years spent working in Korea, where I earned a monthly salary of $2,830. This allowed me to accumulate a significant amount of money (particularly when converted to Indian currency upon my return) to cover daily expenses, potential job search delays, or unforeseen health emergencies.\n\nGiven these circumstances, I advise you to make your decisions thoughtfully. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.",
        "I would send this to Microsoft.",
        "Believe me I tried so hard but haven't gotten any other offers so far. ( not counting the 1-2lpa offers)",

        "When I worked there few years ago, even contractor accounts had Office365, which includes windows. This is probably just a lazy IT admin refusing to work without tickets, not that company is using pirated copies. However, It's true that everyone except engineering has ancient computers.",

    "light_cleaned_comments": "Is that essential for your job. \"good enough\" Report to Microsoft lol, ig every company should have licences to run windows Can they get sued for this? All likelihood their licensing server is down. Enterprise licenses are not manually entered while installing windows, they are linked to a licensing server on their corporate network. I guess Microsoft can sue for this. Microsoft is serious about organisations using pirated software \"Restart and it'll be just fine\" Is this not pirated this is inactive. fr microsoft gonna sue them since they are using it for commercial purpose That means it is pirated cause organisations get all their computers activated by just paying once or monthly (idk about this). They simply didn't or ignore it. You should do something about it if you can instead of ranting here Na in our firm mass licensing require one dedicated sever which validates all licenses with MS. Ours show the same error when the main one kills itself after an autodesk update. It’s pretty normal in all corporate networks running old legacy mixed services.. Accha aise kaam krta hain Lol, it probably is not activated. Companies procure batch licenses. This is probably a thing where the IT team just didn't activate it or the license server is down. lol this is why Indian freshers need to be taught tech the right way. Not activating dose not mean it’s pirated. There are audits and checks. You are just a fresher in corporate take patience to understand things lol bro aaj hi interview diya h iss company k liye I remember this issue in my old MNC, I remember the hardware person explaining that he did activate it, but when they change hardware (ram, hard disk etc) or a part of the pc. The license gets reset because I don't know how exactly it works but windows recognises it as a completely new pc due to hardware change. Somebody more knowledgeable can explain it better than me 😅 lol, the managers there get newspaper subscriptions and add it to the company bill. These guys are cheapskate's of different proportions... They are profitable because they are using open source. no those are volume licenses, the techncian or whoever was it didnt punch the license, but they would have enough in there to cover the requirement I though windows as in actual windows and that was another debate in my head for a sec In 2012, my initial employer was L&T Infotech, and I believe I can provide some insights. When it comes to their spending habits, the answer is a resounding yes – they are quite frugal. As for the quality of hardware provided to employees, the answer is a definite no. The laptops they furnish are subpar, and obtaining administrative privileges is a protracted process. &#x200B; Regarding compensation, when I started as a fresher in 2012, our monthly pay was around 21k, which was about 4-5k less than what companies like Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and Accenture were offering at that time. However, considering my career's modest progression at the time, and the fact that L&T Infotech offered me a job despite having a career below 60%, I considered it a reasonable deal. &#x200B; I've heard from some friends who have re-joined the company recently that they are now receiving much better pay. But from the perspective of a former software engineer, substandard hardware isone of the most demoralizing aspects of the experience. &#x200B; Do I regret working there? Not at all. It was at L&T Infotech that I got my first opportunity to work onsite within just 11 months of starting, which allowed me to save money and eventually pursue fitness training certification, leading to my current career as a fitness consultant in Amsterdam. Well you are working on the data of 1999 so that make sense lol Okay. I was working for Mindtree before it became LTI Mindtree. I have a lot of friends there who are in senior dev positions and some are even team leads. And all of them have said this to me.... Mindtree has gone down in every facet since the L&T take over. And the worst thing that has suffered is the corporate environment. Most likely what happened Fuck Microsoft >Not activating dose not mean it’s pirated. They didn't activate on time. Or let it expire or didn't get enough licences. OP is smart enough to know that this isn't supposed to be happening. Laughing at him and providing vague responses just shows more about you than OP. >There are audits and checks. This should have been caught ahead of time in a proper audit check. Just because there are some audits and checks doesn't mean they are good. >You are just a fresher in corporate take patience to understand things A fresher who is highlighting these things is better than some slightly experienced person laughing it off and calling for \"patience\" and what not. Lol...dude you don't even have a laptop...you are commenting on license.. may be L&t don't trust you with assets Braindeath seeing this . Corporates have volume licensing server which is probably just down or they are doing some upgrades or changed few hardwares in the pc which you are using and needs a new license from the license server which will be in corporate network . 6th gen i5 is not bad for office pc spending unnecessary and creating e waste is a bad thing Wait till you find out how they treat their employees in the middle eastern projects. That is not how it works. If they can show proof that they have purchased 1000 licenses and have 1000 active machines, Microsoft doesn’t care if you activate them or not. Audit will go smoothly nonetheless. It looks like a training room, maybe that's why they didn't bother with the licence. Yes it's a training room. But I think a corporation as big as L&T ought to license all their pcs. Same goes with post office Not once did I call pirated, maybe you need to learn how to read the right way. It's been like this for 3 months, I find it hard to believe the licensing server is down for this long. Shit happens. I’ve had this message show up in my system for over 6 months. Did some digging around and found out about this whole licensing server thing and that it’s like the bottom most priority, cos they had enough evidence of procuring necessary licenses incase MS audited them. Tbh, that's true, but these pcs have 4gigs of ram and a 500gig hdd. Just booting up , starting the three kinds of monitoring software and vscode takes an excruciating 20 minutes. Schools and colleges only focus on how to develop apps not these small licensing thing. Most software engineers don't even know the basic parts of a PC and how they function. Heck I might even say that 99% of IT people can't even build a PC themselves. They only know the On/Off switch of a laptop. How fucking pathetic is that. So for a whole fucking decade a server stays shut down ? Licensing is validated at frequent intervals, not just during OS installation. So if the server went down yesterday and isn’t up yet, all machines reporting to that server will show this message. Where did the decade thing even come from? Hhahahahaha get them a fine [https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-do-i-report-to-microsoft-an-offer-of-pirated/43e4ee28-e1d5-4dcd-9607-7a8eccce4728](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-do-i-report-to-microsoft-an-offer-of-pirated/43e4ee28-e1d5-4dcd-9607-7a8eccce4728) You should see wipro lol.

Linus had mentioned this in a video once when asked about Windows and why he gets the Activate Windows message. And my ass looking for job here!! Bhai kms Pico se tu hi windows activate kar de sari, kya pata raise mil jaye But not when it comes to employee review \"we only tolerate perfection\" To put it into scale the company has posted a profit of **13,398 crores** in the last 12 months and has paid a total dividend of and has given investors some 600 crores in dividends... :) Wow. That escalated quickly. Can you tell us more about how you got in to fitness consultation and got a job in amsterdam. Must be a dream job. Nobody should be paying for this shitty OS. Move to Linux I'm grateful that you inquired. Fitness has always been a passion of mine. Back in 2011, I was quite thin, but by 2012, I had transformed myself into an acceptable shape, weighing almost 74 kilograms with a significant amount of muscle. When the opportunity arose for me to take on an overseas assignment in Korea with the software company I joined in 2012, I recognized it as my chance to save money for my fitness certifications. At that time, I was earning $2,830 USD, and my monthly expenses ranged from $800 to $1,300 USD, so financially, I was in a good position. &#x200B; However, I wasn't sure where to begin professionally. I started by joining a nearby gym near Samsung Suwon called Top Fitness for my regular training. There, I would encounter some national athletes and coaches who came for training very early in the morning. Over time, I managed to establish a rapport with them and sought their guidance on how to start a professional career in fitness. I enrolled in a CPT program at an affiliated institute and completed the Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) and Corrective Exercise Specialist (CES) certifications within a span of two years. &#x200B; Upon returning to India after three years, I made the decision to leave software engineering behind and joined Gold's Gym as an assistant fitness trainer. During this time, I gained valuable experience and honed my skills, particularly while assisting an in-house trainer from David Lloyd Amsterdam during a 10-day personal training session at Radha Hometel in Bangalore. He extended an offer for me to work at David Lloyd in Amsterdam, and I eagerly accepted. This marked the beginning of my professional journey, and I've since expanded my network. I currently work at a different fitness chain and provide fitness consulting services for young athletes and mid-level corporate professionals. &#x200B; I understand that my story may not be glamorous or cinematic, but all I can say is that I feel fortunate for the opportunities I've had. If you have any questions about certifications, the process, duration, or anything else, please feel free to ask. Mf what are you saying this is the most cinematic shit I’ve read on here in a long time! Job well done. Thank you, sir. I've been fortunate in many ways, with hard work playing a significant role, but I also attribute a substantial portion of my success to the divine blessings. Just so that you also know, I wasn't the only one on this kind of journey. A friend from the same company and batch is now working as a fitness consultant in New Zealand. He pursued a professional master's degree, and he served as my inspiration because I knew if it was the wrong path, he wouldn't have ventured down it. Haha that’s great to hear buddy. Unfortunately my journey to the gym is hard work enough for me. If you’ve got some cutting fat and gaining muscle simultaneously tips and tricks with a good PPL split, help out this gareeb. I don't get why big organizations don't use Linux universally. Some do, but many don't, even though there are great options like Lubuntu, Mint, and Debian for low-end PCs. Linux could solve the issue of slow boot and shutdown times. Plus, LibreOffice is a solid alternative to Microsoft Office. I'm genuinely curious why more organizations aren't adopting these solutions. If anyone has insights, please share. Aa jao DM me karte hai kuch prabandh. OP use jpeg for photos ffs. > The pcs are also pretty old, the vast majority being 4th-6th gen core i3/i5. my laptop is 7th gen i3 lol Hmmm I thought you were saying L&T is a Linux desktop shop. Which would have been a good thing actually Should have joined a better company ig My question, why in the fuck is this image of 15mb? No. well Indian perfection == \"good enough\" He said he has 5th gen i5 and i7 in those computers. I thought you meant the licenses with companies to get the pcs not msoffice lmao. Most of the government offices in India don't use windows. Not sure but, cost cutting? Time to switch to the better os for productivity. ( Fun fact it is free! ) If they have a volume licensing agreement which they probably do, they’re legally ok with running the pc without a license installed. They’ve already paid for the license for that PC. With the salaries they pay, they can’t afford engineers either. chup chaap kaam kar na. Reddit post bana raha h kaam par. Boss ko batau terae ? I see \"15-Jul-99\". Is this is the delayed resurrection of the dreaded Y2K? ;-) The bank I audited was upgrading to Finacle 10 from Fincale 7 so the zonal office asked them to upgrade all their PC to Windows 10. So they installed pirated copies on all the systems by paying 250 Rs per install. Pta nahi thaa toh bol mat na This. Microsoft is pretty good about chasing down enterprises. I think you should delete the post before they find this and fire you for baseless shit talk. Should be easy enough for someone to figure out the conference room setup and who you were by the angle since it most certainly will have had cameras around. >licensing server is down. should not matter, once the key is issue and activation is done via internet on the workstation the license server plays no further part. You are wrong sir. Interesting. Now I'm curious how do companies like Microsoft, AutoDesk & Adobe audit big companies like L&T, TCS, etc. > I find it hard to believe the licensing server is down for this long. Have you much experience of corporate IT? Often it works the other way round. Legal often seek to assert licensing to remove liability. I'm really surprised that a huge company is pinching pennies like this If this is a temp setup used for trainings or labs (windows reinstalled every few months) then they usually keep these pcs on an isolated lan for security reasons. So they won't have access to the license server (although these pcs will usually be isolated from the Internet too). MI doesn't need windows...Excel is very safe. Similar situation in the company I'm working in. At least the copy of Windows is original, but no MS Office, instead they have provided OpenOffice. My laptop is a 5th gen i3. Lol Someone else does it for them You mean LTIMT? Thats an amazing journey. Well done buddy... To be honest, I wish I could break the shackles and do something like that. Im from the medical fraternity and doing the hard grind in a gulf country. I could only dream of taking a risk like you did. But, nice to see someone follow their passion.... Maybe 5 years down the line, I might look to do that once I move to India... Thank you for your kind words of appreciation. To provide you with a comprehensive understanding of why I was able to take this risk, let me outline the key factors: 1. Both my parents were government employees, so they were financially independent, and I wasn't responsible for their financial well-being. 2. I had a total work experience of four years when i quit , with nearly three years spent working in Korea, where I earned a monthly salary of $2,830. This allowed me to accumulate a significant amount of money (particularly when converted to Indian currency upon my return) to cover daily expenses, potential job search delays, or unforeseen health emergencies. Given these circumstances, I advise you to make your decisions thoughtfully. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. I would send this to Microsoft. Believe me I tried so hard but haven't gotten any other offers so far. ( not counting the 1-2lpa offers) It won't be hard to find who you are if there are smart people working at l&t. If you need your job, better to delete something which can identify you. Doesn't matter. They already fired me. I am your HR. We will track and find you. True Power Builders here (oldies hit like and subscribe if you get the reference) New to reddit bhai ,care to explain please 🙏🏻 i Iss fatichar joke ka qatl karte hue, jawab ye raha aap ke computer iscreen par: Hahaaa bahot bahot shukriya mere bhai😹 How old are u ? It’s not that simple sometimes there are multiple underlying issues for example actual activation application is blocked by your AV or the link to Microsoft activation server is blocked in your environment (Internet block) hence it is unable to activate and even your IT team is not aware of this issue best you can do is raise a service ticket to them they should be able to get this clears When I worked there few years ago, even contractor accounts had Office365, which includes windows. This is probably just a lazy IT admin refusing to work without tickets, not that company is using pirated copies. However, It's true that everyone except engineering has ancient computers. Better get on Debian ;) Atleast you ain't got a laptop that seems like a probable crime weapon the police are looking for....had to sanitize that shit with a bottle of Dettol and pack full of napkins you can use UWD to remove that watermark Better yet, show me your mousepad Lot of US companies does that too ...they often use Google office for all their Office needs ...why buy license then ? 1. Could this belong to an outsourced vendor of LNT. A contract employee. 2. LNT has SAM (software asset management) tools and consultants who monitor these things. 3. Hard to believe a normal employee user has an expired windows license. If you don’t have anything valuable to add better shut it up. Piracy in Indian corporate is not frowned upon, they get the official version of Windows from Microsoft. These computers are sourced in bulk from a known and trusted vendor . This seems like a training room hence they might have missed activation . Project terminals are very strictly checked for compliance and updates . These freshers are noobs who are badmouthing their bread and butter even before they complete their training without understanding the basics. >If you don’t have anything valuable to add better shut it up Applies to you too. You added nothing except to cover up bad practices and making excuses. Continue sucking the corporate dick >This seems like a training room hence they might have missed activation Yeah, this is not something to be proud of either even if it's a training room. They shouldn't miss here too. Your original comment had a whole lot of judgement and bullshit with zero valuable information. lol you jobless prick, I have better things to do than argue with an idiot over a passing observation Fucking hell dude. My current company hired me at 18k/month in 2023. Techie manager here - I agree with u/thrSedec44070maksup - in all likelihood their licensing server is down. Also, it is not unusual for larger companies to 'sweat the assets' in a tight market. Laptop refresh cycle used to be 3-4 years but is being pushed out to 5-6 years. OP, if you have hard-data and the $alls, file a whistleblower complain. L&T is a public company and has a [Whistleblower policy - link from googling](https://www.ltts.com/sites/default/files/investors/corporate-gov/pdf/WhistleBlowerPolicy.pdf) I understand the frustration, I was fortunate, although it didn't seem that way at that time. Strangely, despite not having a strong career foundation with a 60% career percentage , I managed to secure a position at L&T Infotech. This appeared to be a favorable choice for me compared to my friends who were earning slightly more at companies like Infosys and Tech Mahindra. Nowadays, I've heard that the industry is facing a recession, so it's essential to persevere, exercise patience, and remember that valuable opportunities require time, hard work, and, most importantly, building connections within the senior professional network. Perseverence is all I've got from ending it all right now. Jyada load maat lo ,take yourself little less seriously. I will tell you this You have a job,a lot of people are still struggling to get one. You already have concurred the first step so the first hit of cold water in shower in a winter morning is what you have already achieved. And remember this when things get better with time,someday some evening with a glass of scotch in hand you will remember these days and say ‘kya din the’ and just laugh about the old you to realize how far you have walked. Dude, they are looking at an excel sheet that has 5 columns in it. A Pentium 533mhz processor & 256mb ram is sufficient for this stuff. Its weird but I already know these facets. I've been working for 4 years now in this tier-2 city and the highest salary I've earned is 20k/month which was the job before this. I have grined upon those 'kya din the vo' moments and been through multiple fires to do my job(s) diligently. Life just isn't easing as of yet. Everyday feels the same. Its just in & out and in & out. I want to go back to wfh. Im working as a BA right now in this small ass company. Im learning SQL to hopefully upskill and jump shark by the end of year. Any tips? This looks like a training room? I wish organization such as L&t move towards open source software. Imagine all subcontractors have to buy licences for Office, AutoCAD and other software only because organisation like l&t makes you buy them...and they are prohibitively expense for smaller organisations. The same is with many companies including Top Indian banks, even the government ones. Larsen & Toubro may be posting profits, but it is still in crisis. Uday Kotak was asked to save Larsen Toubro some years ago. There was a detailed article on the same. The OP is the one who said the PCs were old. Not me. Why are they looking at data from '99? That's nothing TCS can't even afford a freeware. Most large companies have a bounty on reporting organizations using unlicensed software. You can report anonymously, and you get a percentage of the money recovered."
