Within a week I turned on the targeted ad. Now I am freaked sometimes but never grossed out. Yes the ads of condoms are like borderline porn and it should be made more user discretionary but these ads are much needed in a country like ours which just crossed china on population. People here are really advocating for sex education for kids saying they should be comfortable with condom advertisements? Have you seen how overly sexualised those adds are? Wtf is wrong with you people ? Safe sex ads are not the same as these. Condom ads by companies is not same as sex education/ awareness. These ad are just attractive marketing tools used by companies just like any other products. ( That's how promotions and marketing work ) Seems like they have just started. I never knew. I don't really get it. What's the problem man? I used to see manforce/skore ad every over when i used to watch cricket with dad on TV. Also the ads are relative and targeted to your account history. Consider Youtube Premium if you dont want ads Teach em young Please use incognito for your deeds. I only can't block ads on my TV and since last three months I am almost only getting the same Comfort fabric conditioner ad when I use youtube tv Or just use it on Brave Browser, removes all the adds, damn I get irritated these days watching it on laptop becausee I am used to seeing no ads in my phone ! Turn on recommendation based ads in your Google account if you don't want to see random weird ads like these. Stop being horny, you're phone knows what you want Buy premium.. 130 rs per month... peace of mind.. I got YouTube premium. No ads whatsoever. It has been a saviour. no vanced is abandoned thanks to youtube, also this ad appears even in new accounts Bro take the premium It's like 180 rs a month. I have added 4 of my friends in the family group, so it falls to 35 rs each. Not a bad deal if you can get friends to share with you. I frequently watch youtube on my smart tv so premium is a must have. Revanced Why do you care creep google ads are by default set to personalized ads, so maybe you........ use Brave browser , just oike Chrome but with adblockers ðŸ˜‚ Nop. I always had personalised ads and daily activity turned off. bro this is half the reason i bought premium family. runs 6accounts for 189per month. i spend more on fast food so its kinda justified If you are using Android TV then sideload Smart YouTube app it's basically YouTube without ads I'll give you a tip which works for me all the time , After searching for condoms on Google app or shopping apps , search more about Children's toys or skin care products, or Fashion products. What's wrong in asking ,is that a crime if this is on a TV install SmartTubeNext. enjoy no ads. Brother/Sister. Why are you, an android user, NOT USING REVANCED? Actually it depends on what you've selected as your audience when you set up the ad. For a condom and like this it's entirely possible that the advertiser is just targeting all males 18 and older. It's not necessary that they selected any audience behaviours. Source: I do this for a living You shouldn't be downvoted, you're right. It's obviously possible to target based on past behaviour, but it's also totally possible to put only basic demographic targeting like gender and age and let the ad show to anyone who fits \"male, 18-25\" as a description. There is but he's 18+, google knows the kind of content you watch and recommends ads accordingly. Can never forget the continuous Condom ads while watching IPL with family. The problem is not the Condom ads. The problem is the obscenity in the ads. And now they are experimenting not letting people with ad blockers access YouTube. Download youtube extended revanced app and you'd get settings to turn off ads, shorts etc. Youtube at one point ask for 18+ check for some videos. I think it know that you are adult and showing the ad. You should consider new account for TV or family Revanced for dummies Search on Google and thank me later If on Apple devices Cercube ipa Search it and dive onto sideloading apps in iPhone and iPads private dns: dns dot adguard dot com YouTube app: ReVanced Hardware Adblocker: Pi Zero 2W running pi hole Chrome Adblocker: Adblock plus (or pro I forgot the name, >!if you reply to me with \"brave\" I'll mri you with a butt plug!<) My brother in Christ, use incognito browsers and alt accounts to do your shady activities. You getting condom ads does reflect your internet history. Your kids will grow up with this as a core memory, and then realisation hits... try searching for songs and see the new suggestions I just got premium There's a reason youtube kids is a thing. Use revanced Happens because a large majority of youtube users in India are using it for tharki videos. The entire region gets tagged by Google AI as being Tharki. The content assembling AI then gets tharki content, promotes tharki content, and tharki ads to show the region in the hopes of being called a goodboy. Delete your unique ID, change region to US or EU, empty cache and cookies. That was like one of the the first thing they started delivering in instamart. Well you've a kid so kinda right demography lol That was not the point I'm making I have smart tube next installed in all the firesticks on my tvs at home so I try to save my kids from any ads. Sometimes they watch youtube kids app too on tv and there are ads but few and far and usually of stuff like lego or hamleys. They rarely watch on tablet. But I would appreciate if someone can tell me what app to install on tablet for getting ad free experience. Also it would be great if login into account is possible on that app. Cant use AdBlocker anyway. It's still better than Dev Gadhvi's ads. Revanced or newpipe. No i dont. Title of the video is \"Kamasutra long last condoms | 20 seconds.\". Lol apne pair pe kulhadi maarna We want sex education in school but condom ads are 18+? The female lines were sung by Jonita Gandhi. Premium Kharidh, No Ads. Not always. With OP here. I once foolishly turned off Ad personalization in my Google account and got blasted borderline illegal ads. I hope the guys who ran the ads got arrested. You can change settings to allow only age appropriate content. People here pretending like Condom ads are sex education. When was the last time you saw an condom ad which was actually educating people in what condom is? Condom ads nowadays are stylised semi porn. I don't want any of 5yo to see those things. Sex education can be taught where it is supposed to be, In school text books or by parents. Not by random ad in youtube with half naked people lusting for each other. Note : There is difference between sexual content and sex education. Both are not the same. That's why I have YT Premium subscription just use ad-blocker mein duden There is a time and place for everything, try watching that ad in-front of your family or small kids ,and see how comfortable you are watching that. If you can handle that scenario, then no issues . Most people canâ€™t Ads in Google are customized based on your profile, browsing history, what you tell the mic can hear ;) 189 to be precise but it's damn worth it if you ask me. I don't think Alt Balaji ads helps in sex ed in any form. ðŸ˜‚ Us bhai us ðŸ¥¹ No but for real most of you are really regressive in this topics."
