Second what if he meant to put it in the bin but the call he had to attend to was reallly important. People are just judging the guy for such a little context provided. And if he just left that there and did not plan to drink or throw it then in that case it would be wrong.",

Then the school people promptly threw the full cardboard box out the moving train. For all 3 meals. :)",

While coming from hyd to ker , a handicapped guy begged for money in a skateboard like thing..( idk the ride's real name).. His acting was pretty convincable.. When the train was abt to took off , he took his ride and ran away with no probs in his legs... Also i spotted an iphone X in his hands.. Big assumption to expect them to feel any shame in the first place They are not beggars they are earning from your emotions 21st century scam _disguises himself as a beggar, masks off he's a dude with no crutches or whatever_ _Entitled educated illiterates_ I once told a passenger to not litter inside the train or throw plastic outside. I received a lecture instead. It was a dry plastic wrapper that could have been carried easily and dropped into bins that are available inside a station. People just don't give a shit about keeping public places in public transport clean. \"It's the cleaning person's job to clean after us\" everyone thinks they're fucking royalty lmao. People need to learn humility and personal accountability. Hey, I did that. Literally asked him, whether he has finished his tea and he said yes. I took it and threw it in dustbin. I came back and just said, it's our property (mentioning the train). He said he would have eventually done that ( it was there for an hour). I just said, it's okay. Lmao some people forget 🥲 He'll probably tell his child that it's *smarter* to throw away trash from the car's window. Nobody will wonder who threw it. And also teach him to litter garbage wherever he sits That's actually an underrated logical explanation as to why they're so fucking reckless. Casteism is an evil which itself leads to other evils The lack of civic sense while forming queues because everyone wants to save their precious *time* I have started doing the same too… and I just stare at them and if they don’t look like they have shame, I smile and say hi… Wtf are you on? Chatgpt? Indians have one issue, and that is ego. \"Throwing trash is not my job, it's the cleaner's. He'll do it. I am not entitled to throw trash.\" Even parents don't encourage their to do stuff that \"degrades\" their imaginary image. Ego even when you're at the lowest point in your life. It's somewhat mean when I say it, but we as a society have too much ego and too little humbleness. We consider ourselves so high and mighty without any reason. Solution: We can't change the current society, but we can change the system in such a way that the new generation is better than ours. How? Improving the schooling and education system. It should focus greatly on personality development and morals rather than just \"completing the syllabus quickly for exams\". Antibiotics and codeine. make eye contact while doing it 👀 What ends up happening is the children don't have enough vocabulary to express themselves in neither English nor in the mother tongue. Careless and \"padhe likhe gawar\" moment from that so called gentleman. However I hope that you grabbed that cup and put it in the bin after you clicked a pic. ......Right? meri train me ek amma ne seat pe tatti krdi thi aur tu ispe ro raha hai bhai Sometimes I put my trash below my berth and when I get off the train I pick it up and throw it in the dustbin when I get off the train as the bin is generally near the Door if it's not the 1st AC coach. Definitely the aim is to keep environment clean and pick up trash even when no one is noticing but in this case, if they see it at least some sense of shame is instilled, they might not repeat it. I am not saying pick it so that someone will see it and tap your shoulder for a good job done! Every compartment should have it's own dustbin and maybe piss on them too *wrong conversation* AC trains (at least the good ones like rajdhani for overnight journey) are supposed to have attendants who will bring you everything you need/want to purchase/ was included in your ticket and take everything away for each meal, it's part of the ticket and you are paying for it. They also collect tips at the end of the journey for this reason. I am not justifying it but it's how things normally are, if you didn't have the same experience, you missed out on a good attendant. Basically the space below the AC lower berths are used as dustbins Passengers are so lazy to move their arse as that they Conveniently shove the used cups and plates below thereby inviting cockroaches .Then you have another set of people who will make reel on the roaches and blame the govt for not maintaining hygiene in coaches.. r/uselessredcircle I would've said \"why didn't they throw it in the dustbin.\" But I've seen the dustbins on the trains and 9/10 they are overflowing with rubbish anyway. They should've drained out the tea but keeping the cup under the seat WAS the most civil way possible. Unless you want them to throw it out of the window. This is such a sad reality Maybe he is the one who left it 🤣 Last night I was traveling in Malabar express in HA1 sleeper compartment. Mine was the side upper berth. In the middle of the night I felt something passing by my feet. And decided to check what it was, and realized that the passenger who got onboard in the lower berth decided to go crumble the bed sheet & blanket’s brown paper covers and shove it to the bottle holders next to my foot rest in the upper berth by putting his hands through the close blinds. Most people have two excuses for doing this: 1) I am paying money so I can do this. 2) someone else will litter if not me. Some even would be willing to fight if you ask them to throw in trashcan. When people take things for granted I'll do you do you one better... Do it while they're still drinking it The kind of economy and inflation we have anything like this can happen bo surprises My mother used to say, its always people with rich look in parties who attacks the food first out of order. This same chomu will go out there and say \"India mein itna kachra hai, log saaf nahi rakhte. We don't deserve infrastructure\" Don’t get me wrong everyone. But this is so true. I had never travelled abroad until recently. People in countries like Netherlands and US are really so much aware of their surroundings. They respect people’s space, public spaces. Even homeless people. That is why travel is so important. If people travelled more, they would understand new people, new cultures, new ways of being civil, living in a society. I know this sounds cliche but people in India really need to learn to be more respectful towards others and public property. Which is sadly not going to happen very soon. Love this comment. You got it on point! Amazed to see how many people just jump on the gun before even confirming the whole context. First what if the guy plans to drink the soup? I am not saying it is good to put that on the floor when he can keep it on his seat but it really isnt that big of a deal. Second what if he meant to put it in the bin but the call he had to attend to was reallly important. People are just judging the guy for such a little context provided. And if he just left that there and did not plan to drink or throw it then in that case it would be wrong. Or even better, pick up the cup and finish the soup while staring into their eyes. Couple days ago I was coming in a train with some kids going for a school trip in the AC coach. The school arranged food for them, and once the 60-70 kids were done eating, they nicely put everything in one bag/cardboard box outside the cabin. Then the school people promptly threw the full cardboard box out the moving train. For all 3 meals. :) Did u see 'Bald and Bankrupt' latest video on youtube? The title is ' I visited India, so you dont have to'"
