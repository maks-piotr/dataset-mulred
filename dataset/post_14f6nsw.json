        "**Booking.com** : They're international first. I recently booked a flight with them & had to cancel it. The airline issued a full refund without any deductions but Booking refunded only a portion of it. Now, they don't have a number or email to contact & there's no support through the website. Cherry on the cake? All booking.com flight bookings are handled by gotogate.com which has such a marvellous reputation that I hardly found any positive review of them online. Overall, you'll be f\\*\\*ked & there'll be no one to contact easily.",
        "**Flipkart** (group) : This one, ohh! It's not just Flipkart, it's all the companies under their whole group. Flipkart, Myntra, Cleartrip etc. My hands would hurt if I start narrating everything about them, so I'll keep to the top ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyntra's amazing customer support considers \"Deletion\" of an account as \"Suspension\", which I accidently did. I sent them a mail to delete my account & they suspended/banned me. Cherry on the top, they don't have an option to un-suspend the account. Wow! Brilliant.\n\nFurthermore, their s\\*\\*t return policies, convenience charges, refund defaults to myntra credit & not bank balance, random suspension warnings should be enough for anyone to stay away from them. Anyone & Everyone will only realise it once they lose their money in one way or another because their management, policies & support is trash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlipkart is the same. Rs. 29-99 as an extra charge to buy a mobile, in the same packaging like any other product? Hell no. I'm confused as to why have they been able to pull this s\\*\\*t off for so long & why is everyone paying it. Most of their phones are exclusive, meaning the customer can't buy it anywhere else. So taking anything over the MRP as a mandatory charge should be illegal because there's no competition. Similarly, Rs. 5-10 to pay using COD. WTF! I've had many purchases where I had to pay 500-1000 extra because the price was more on Amazon but at least their support is top notch & overall experience is amazing.\n\nOne more thing, their so called \"plus\" program. First, you can't really use those supercoins for a lot of things. Then, most won't realise but Flipkart has discriminatory pricing. For many products, open it while logged in & in incognito, you'll see a different price. Same is for supercoins. For Eg. A product priced Rs. 249 normally will be sold for Rs. 99 + 300 Supercoins if you buy it through their supercoins reward store.",
        "**Swiggy** : I haven't really used Zomato a lot, but when I did, the experience was decent. One reason is that Zomato has so many bu\\*\\*shit charges that I don't order with them. When I tried Swiggy, the pricing was alright so I used it. 2-3 orders were fine but when the 4th one was not, was I saw their true face. It's true that you can judge a company by how their customer support is. \n\nSwiggy's support just did it for me that I wouldn't deal with them every again and only use a credit card if I have to so that I can atleast dispute the charge. I had ordered a meal & some items & they items delivered were missing many & were not what was ordered. The amount must have been 1200. When we complained, they offered a refund of Rs. 240 something. Great! Items missing worth Rs. 600 and the refund of 240. \n\nThat's not all, the support even transferred this as a coupon which can be used on an order within a month. Marvellous! Now I have to spend more money to use my money because the coupon has its own restrictions like only eligible on orders over 1000 or something.",
        "**Paytm** : Again! Customer Support. Paytm is not a small startup. They're capable of having a decent end to end customer support experience but all they have is trash. There's no direct number to call, the one they have has to be jumped through hoops to talk to a human. Even if you get to talk, they'll create a ticket by sending you an email & now you'll be jumping back and forth over email without knowing when will they reply. \n\nThe problem gets bigger because Paytm doesn't provide the service themselves, they're a huge aggregator of everything. So if anything f\\*\\*ks up from any third party, you'll have to jump between that party and Paytm (through which you got the service) and lack of [C.support](https://C.support) will definitely make it messy. All they really have is chat bots which never reach a human.",
        "**Zingbus** : I had booked a ticket from Rajkot to Dwarka (Gujarat) a week ago from the date of departure. No issues there, payments done, tickets delivered, seats allotted and done.\n\nWe're in the middle of our rail journey and the moment we get off the train tomorrow morning, we were supposed to board the (zing)bus. But!!!\n\nJust now we received messages from them saying that they've cancelled the tickets.\n\nWhy? Don't know.\n\nSupport? Call their number and the automated message says that you can text them on WhatsApp. WTF! So the phone number can't be used to call you. Brilliant. Without WhatsApp, support doesn't exist.\n\nNo message in the cancellation stating the reason.\n\nThe only good thing? There was clear communication about the refund which has been automatically initiated.\n\nI checked travel websites and the bus isn't available as an option anymore, as if it didn't exist. I had been regularly checking that bus and more than half the seats seemed to have been empty. Probably, due to lack of passengers, they cancelled the bus completely.\n\nWith this kinda support and service, you're better off booking even a government bus. Atleast you can be sure that you won't be stranded somewhere. Luckily, we found another not so ideal bus but it won't be the case everywhere.\n\nBut with service like this, the chances are high that if you have connecting journeys and even 2-3 zingbus bookings in a long trip, your trip will come to a standstill even if they cancel one of the buses and then the Domino effect will have you miss your bookings after that where you were supposed to reach at a specific time.",

        "Aqua Guard water purifier.....Their service person damaged the filter of my under warranty purifier during service. Then they asked me to pay full amount for the new filter, after 10 days they offered 50% discount, then blamed me for the delay in repair by not taking their calls. Thieves!!!",
        "I have an Asus laptop from 2010 which is still doing very well. Was a windows laptop and I moved it to Linux some years ago, and it is still working fine.",
        "Good thing you can extend warranty to 3 years with 1 year damage protection for 3k-4k rs. On that asuspromo site atleast for the more expensive laptops i think. \n\nThey're the only brand that compromise neither on performance,screen or battery life while staying compact imo",
