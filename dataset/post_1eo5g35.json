    "selftext": "My brother, who is currently pursuing his master's degree from Uppsala University in Sweden, was attacked on his way back to his dorm room last night. He was struck on the head multiple times with a blunt weapon, suffered heavy blood loss, has 7 stitches in the middle of the head(above the parietal bone). The attacker left him to die on the roadside, but somehow he regained consciousness and made his way to safety. Although the police hasn't reported anything yet, we suspect a hate crime, as nothing was stolen from him... The attacker had the clear intention of murder. Over the last 20 hours, we have tried contacting the MEA and the Indian Embassy in Sweden through call, email, and even Twitter for help, but there have not been any responses. \n\nThe Indian Embassy in Sweden answered our calls, but we were told straightaway that they can provide no help whatsoever. If there was an attempted murder of a foreign national in India, there would be much better responses, but sadly, it seems as if the MEA doesn't care about its people as much. He doesn't have a local guardian there, and none of my family members have a passport. We are completely helpless in this situation. If anyone can help us reach out an officer from the embassy, or the ministry, it would be a huge help for us, and may ensure that the attacker is found sooner and safer environment is available for our students if foreign countries. \n\nPlease help in any way that you can.",

Especially not in Uppsala which is a progressive student city. That being said racism occurs such as in any place of the world, but that there was a coordinated group of people or single person attacking someone is highly unlikely. \n\nMy only thought of why he could possibly be attacked is because of he was mistaken (simply being in the wrong place and wrong time when some drug fused teenagers) were suppose to attack some gang member or something. \n\nAnyways if you have any more to add pls do",

This is of course not to say that the victim was related to crime - sometimes innocent people get caught up in it.\n\nHowever, all this does of course not mean that this being a hate crime can be ruled out. And I can reassure you that the people who matter (police/investigators) won’t rule it out.",

As soon as I crossed him, he came up behind me and attacked me. I don't remember much after that, he hit me on the back of my head, probably multiple times and I was instantly disoriented and dizzy.

Don't know how many nights I've strolled around in the area.\n\nI'm happy to hear that the police has been contacted! Don't expect it to go quickly (except many months at best) (and as I think others have pointed out, no embassy or politician can influence the investigation), but it will be taken seriously. And great that there's one (or more) eye witnesses. I've read through comments in this thread, and seen suggestions about cctv - very unlikely that there's any, Sweden is not big on that stuff, particularly around residential areas (and extra particularly around building gates, I don't think that is legal actually). However, house 8 has a rather good view over house 7, so it's quite possible that someone who heard it might have caught it on cell phone video. The downside is that it is still summer, so there's very few people in Flogsta at the moment. \n\nI'm sure your brother is being well cared for at the hospital, akademiska sjukhuset is great.

The issue might be more subtle, like being discriminated against by having a non-Swedish name. That said, as it is obvious from the Sweden sub, there are some really rotten people with some really rotten views. I don't know where they are in real life, but given that there's a relatively large racist party, it's not an insignificant number of people that secretly hold these views. It is absolutely not acceptable to express racism or any other intolerant behaviour IRL, so I don't know if that's why these people get so vocal about online.

He demands to check my bag or he won't let me on the plane. We literally went through security where they X-rayed my bag and I went through their scanner..........\n\nCame to India, went back to the US. White immigration officer is asking me basic details like name and address, again and again for 10 whole minutes. Simply repeating the same questions again and again and again. At this point I'm wondering if I will be rejected for entry. Other people notice and start to comment. He finally relents and lets me through.",
        "Yeah pretty much this. For white people, any person with brown skin = middle eastern = muslim = terrorist",
        "Oh absolutely.",
        "Yeah white people don't like it when you point out their shitty behaviour",
        "Lol, so non-white people must be a carbon copy of white people to be accepted according to you.............funny how you bend over backwards to bootlick and excuse racism.\n\n\"country that welcomed them\" - not so much welcoming in general. They don't like the fact that non-white people are immigrating peacefully into their country. That's it.",
        "It's not just lately. It's always been the case.",
        "It's not just Sweden. All white people have shown their true racist colours. They were always racist.\n\nAlso the entire world is full of right wing extremist movements, hating on the minorities. Buddhist extremists started murdering Muslims in Myanmar for the past several years..............",
        "\"immigration crisis\" - ah yes, non-white people peacefully coming in = immigration crisis\n\nGotta love when white people panic and go crazy because non-white people wanted to also be there.",
        "103 is still not in top 100. I hope you understand that. I never mentioned any Indian uni. Are you hallucinating bro? I don't understand what's got your panties in a bunch over some random fckin university - did they reject you for the janitor position?",
        "What is happening in Sweden !?",
        "Its not even in top 100. Lol. What you talking man.",
        "Indian news agencies will be the most willing to share horrific details and crimes. Less consequences, less control unlike other nations.",
        "Yeah, reality is that humans are shit. A horrible, abusive, psychopathic species. We're not the pinnacle. We are just worms crawling in the mud.",
        "Lol no, I have faced plenty of hostility and racism in the USA. Especially since 2016.",
        "Actually pakora stall is also important. Won't vote for any party if their MEA doesn't help launch pakora stall in other countries.",
        "Technically they do have to register with the government, but yeah you're right.",
        "> Why do you think the embassy is set up there? To send ministers on vacations to foreign countries?\n\nLol yes, under BJP this is their only role. To plan Modi's next vacation.",
        "I worked with a guy from Carnegie Mellon, he was absolutely trash and incompetent at his job.",
        "Hey! I’m an Indian and I live in Uppsala. I’m sorry your brother had to go through this. I’ve DM’ed you in case your brother needs any type of help. I’ve been living in Uppsala for a while and can help with whatever I can and know",
        "Ethnicity more clear description of attacker?",
        "You are right, they have dropped out the last few years. 140 still isn't bad.",
        "It's surprising how a country like Qatar can say \"Hey we organise the world cup, everyone is welcome but this is our country and these are our rules and laws. Stick to those and lets all have fun.\"  \nBut as soon as a Western country does or tries the same, it is suddenly racism...",
        "My brother was almost blacked out the moment he was hit, he couldn't get a good look at him. Sadly, there aren't even any cameras nearby.",
        "How about Pakistani?",
        "Essentially no place is completely fine like in India. You will be a second class citizen wherever you go. \n\nDk about Malaysia but Singapore is not that great a place for Indians. I have family living there in well paid white collar professions. They say that Singapore is kind of like Korea in the sense that people will look down on you if you are dark or brown skinned. A lot of owners won’t rent their apartments to Indians. \n\nThere are also undercurrents of racism and discrimination in the workplace. As far as I know the Chinese are at the top of social hierarchy there and are not very fond of Indians so that might create tension in the workplace",
        "that's fucked",
        "It is.Singapore is also the only place where I myself encountered racism as a tourist. \n\nTo answer your original question, US is still the least racist imho. Canada used to be a good until they started experiencing the immigration crisis due to mass migration of poorly qualified Indians. Now people there hate Indians",
        "yeah US is the only good country ig\n\nNot being racist but Indians in canada going for diploma mills and not following their country's basic rules and creating ruckus is def justified",
        "And the witness?",
        "A lot many of them don't look Indian at all IMO, except for if you could find a super fair person from Kashmir/the other northern states - that is the only instance I can think of that can bring about some confusion. We are significantly darker than them.\n\nWhat we do match with in body structure and looks are with Bangladeshis instead",
        "Bro experienced the average Indian minority experience.",
        "He didn't describe the attacker either, except that he was tall and had a heavy voice.",
        "I think it's a psychopath... Would be good to catch him before he moves on to actual murder",
        "The people from Singapore actually complain about the same thing. Not the diploma mill part but the creating ruckus part. That’s why a lot of them don’t rent apartments out to Indians because apparently Indians with their chalta hai attitude damage the apartment and  don’t leave it in a good condition after they leave.",
        "Damn, I see \n\nI have heard a lot of people in france do the same, not because they are racist but due to the repeated experiences like this",
        "Yes, people do this in the US too. But they’re not very direct about it because they could easily very sued there",
        "Damn\n\nThe number of stereotypes due to a few people is costing us",
        "Thats not true at all . Lol . I know many who work nights in nursing homes , to help people. Who want to drop of but don’t do it . Because of their patients .",
        "Any updated regarding the P4 if they have talked about it? And if the police has gone out with a statement? I haven’t been able to see or hear anything. I live in Uppsala and has been all my life",
        "Hi. I confirmed with the Radio guys, a short segment was aired on p4. However, the police hasn't updated anything on the website yet.\n\n https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/student-skulle-ga-och-handla-blev-attackerad"

    "light_cleaned_title": "Attempted murder on Indian student in Uppsala(Sweden)",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "My brother, who is currently pursuing his master's degree from Uppsala University in Sweden, was attacked on his way back to his dorm room last night. He was struck on the head multiple times with a blunt weapon, suffered heavy blood loss, has 7 stitches in the middle of the head(above the parietal bone). The attacker left him to die on the roadside, but somehow he regained consciousness and made his way to safety. Although the police hasn't reported anything yet, we suspect a hate crime, as nothing was stolen from him... The attacker had the clear intention of murder. Over the last 20 hours, we have tried contacting the MEA and the Indian Embassy in Sweden through call, email, and even Twitter for help, but there have not been any responses. The Indian Embassy in Sweden answered our calls, but we were told straightaway that they can provide no help whatsoever. If there was an attempted murder of a foreign national in India, there would be much better responses, but sadly, it seems as if the MEA doesn't care about its people as much. He doesn't have a local guardian there, and none of my family members have a passport. We are completely helpless in this situation. If anyone can help us reach out an officer from the embassy, or the ministry, it would be a huge help for us, and may ensure that the attacker is found sooner and safer environment is available for our students if foreign countries. Please help in any way that you can.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Pm Uppsala is probably the most dangerous district of Sweden with plenty of Kurdish cartel action. Very unfortunate I live in Finland & I’m well known to the Indian ambassador to Finland. I can talk to them & highlight this issue & maybe some sort of diplomatic communication can be done. Not sure why the Swedish embassy isn’t helpful. Quite unfortunate to hear this incident, Sweden is safe & haven’t heard of hate crimes from there, until now. Next 2 days being weekend ideally no one will respnd from Sweden embassy.. Ur best bet is twitter.. try writing there Have you tried r/sweden or similar? I found a good way of defence, when I was in one of these countries: 1. Never tell these people your place of living. 2. Dress exactly like Swedish People, never like Indians. 3. Stand Tall and Strong, but Cool, like a Marine or any other soldier. 4. The Police of their country will never help you, unless it can be traced back for huge sums of money. 5. Try travelling in Groups. Always wear headgear or clothes that expose very less of your skin colour. It is not inferiority, it is self defence. I tried. I have trying since yesterday. I tagged the Indian embassy in Sweden, MEA, even S Jaishankar ffs, not a single reply Yes, maybe I should. Thank you Tweet to opposition leaders also and news channels. Indian embassy is the worst place in every country. There used to be a time when a tweet would suffice for the MEA to take actions. I wonder why the Indian embassy is so hostile. I don't know about the policy of X now, if its okay to tweet the image of your brother wounded. Maybe give it a try. The justice system has failed big time Post this on Twitter as well tagging them. Why what did they say? I have done it thrice since morning, no response. Because? > you have no evidence of it being a hate crime Even though I specifically added in the title there that it *might* be a hate crime. > It might be, but chances are equal that it was not a hate crime > Hate crime against Indians is not a thing in Sweden. Let the police do their work and they'll find out who he pissed off >If you're going to suspect all of Sweden of a hate crime, I'm going to suspect that whoever did it had a very good reason for attacking your brother. Tit for tat. How old is your Twitter account? Sometimes when the Twitter account is new and has very few followers, the tweets don't show up on the notifications of people you've tagged. In case it's new, ask someone with an older and bigger account to tweet your case. Twitter is your best bet. It worked fine when I tagged Zomato, Airtel, etc. They replied within a short time. Not these guys though. Back when Sushma Swaraj was in charge! :( Now, it’s become a joke. Ah, white people being openly racist to Indian/desi people. Nothing new. It's the same story in all western country subs. You shouldn't have deleted the post. Let them be racist. More interested in conducting yoga day than citizen services WTF was the last comment..!?!?!?.. Yes, I probably shouldn't have. But all I want right now is that my brother gets justice, and that such incidents don't happen again. I'm not in the mental space to entertain some racist twats right now. Fair enough. I hope you get justice. What are your plans rn? Maybe, post on Twitter, and hope the post gets viral? Hoping that it gets enough attention that the authorities on both the sides actually do something. Moreover, I did find some helpful people in this thread, and our close family friend who is a state civil servant is trying to get someone to contact the higher ups in the embassy. Hopefully it works. Why don't you share the link of your Twitter post? We could probably help by retweeting? I am sorry OP. Does your brother have any friends there or contact the Indian communities. The external affairs ministry has gone to dogs so I am not surprised by their response. Mfs are busy with propaganda than doing their actual work Europeans being europeans. Not surprised Jesus Christ for the last line. India and us have become a punching bag of internet lately that these people have no shame in saying such stuff. Thanks, I added them to the post. Exactly. I guess the Minister of EA rn is just about talks Thankfully, he does have some friends who are taking care of him. But if the MEA could push this issue, maybe it would get resolved faster. I used to think that this type of hyper nationalism, where each and everything is associated with the country's pride is limited to the global south, and only a few parts of the western world. But alas, I was so f\\*\\*\\*ing wrong. First, make sure somehow he gets immediate medical attention. Next, I hope he has moved from his current residence to a safer place. Is there any Indian who could help there? Usually, you can reach out to well-established Indians in that city who could potentially help. They may be well-connected as well. There must be many FB groups like ‘Indians in Sweden’ where you could post this & see the response you’ll get. When you brother gets a bit better and feels up for it ask him to record himself from the hospital talking about exactly what happened and upload in on Socials. People justify racism here all the time, saying it is “deserved.” What do people expect to happen, this is the logical byproduct of normalization of hate online, which people like the attacker here consumer. Stay safe, OP. Take care. If you can then add some pics to have credibility otherwise people will think it's fake. Edit: I mean no disrespect sorry if it's offensive Your Twitter profile is quite anonymous , may be try to have some genuine details to get attention. Post this on sweeden subreddit too Great, you want to change the embassy? Join it. They will stop this non sense when sharia law gets enforced and hits them in their balls in future. If roles were reversed there would be comments like I'm ashamed of being Indian. As an I indian i would like to apologise on behalf of my country. What a bunch of clowns we have in our country I couldn’t care less about Sweden or what they do with immigration policies. What they said to OP on their sub is uncalled for. OP, please ensure a timely report is filed at local swedish police station describing the incident, if not done already. document every detail and evidence that's possible. If the matter does get escalated and investigated properly later, this will come handy. what was the point of this comment? do you feel clever now? if the food is bad at a restaurant do you become a chef there? Who tf goes to study there? And do you really expect to gain something out of this post? I want to change your comment so I shall indeed…become you Also, try to contact the university. Their involvement might speed up the police investigation. Damn. Good to know ig Sweden has become very right wing in the past few years. Sweden does have some of the oldest and best universities in the world. Uppsala being one of them. None of the universities and research of India even compare. So lot of people go there to study Can't do shit against Western racism. Punches down on Muslim immigrants instead. Typical. Which state are you from? Ask your local politicians to put pressure on MEA. In Andhra and Telangana local politicians are coordinating with MEA for overseas Indians’ well being. I am sorry to hear about the incident. Please join \"SOS Global Indians\" group on Facebook and post it. This is the biggest group of NRIS on any social media platform. >Who tf goes to study there? As answered by another person, Uppsala University is very old, and has an excellent research program. A lot of people from many different countries study there. >And do you really expect to gain something out of this post? I'll paste my answer to another comment here. Hoping that it gets enough attention that the authorities on both the sides actually do something. Moreover, I did find some helpful people in this thread, and our close family friend who is a state civil servant is trying to get someone to contact the higher ups in the embassy. Hopefully it works. Is it even safe for Indians to go to these countries, these many measures seem awful It is unfortunate your brother was attacked but am glad he is safe. When you want the Swedish police, MEA, etc. to do \"something\", what exactly is that supposed to be? Are you expecting arrests without an investigation? A determination of motive without evidence? Your brother to have a medical evacuation to India? If you are tweeting repeatedly, maybe try being clear on what you want. Focus on getting your brother the needed care and give the cops sometime to process the case. Hello! I'm a swede and this came up randomly on my frontpage. But reading the post I'm unsure what kind of help you (your brother) is in need of? Seems like he got care at somekind of medical facility and it's been reported to the police? I'm guessing he has also contacted his student advisor at the University if he's on leave. Having said that I don't know how non EU persons pay for medical care here nor how this will affect his payment to the university if he takes time off. Is this the problem? Hope he's better soon! Was this Flogsta? Yes, it was. Ok. (I´m a local) Have you sent your brother to Akademiska sjukhuset? (our hospital) I have no clue of how health care works for students from outside of EU - but look him up. It is really new and you just have contacted the police (continue the contact - they will go on this). If you like you can send information to our local paper - UNT (this adress: [72018@unt.se](mailto:72018@unt.se) ). At r/Uppsala is our local sub but we have a link there to this thread. Sorry for your brother and hope everything goes well. I have never heard of hate crimes against indians before, have only seen what looks good, cricket players and similar on gatherings from your part of the world. Yo. OP. I live in Uppsala and work at the University. DM. I don't know how much I can help, but I will do what I can. Btw another indian student from umea university was attacked and killed last year in September. Ik this is unrelated but it goes to show how 'safe' these countries are for indians. Mind you Sweden has the highest gun violence rates in all of EU. They have a problem with unregulated refugees from dangerous war torn countries No this is not correct. Stockholm (rinkeby), Malmö and Gothenburg have the worst districts. Hi, thank you for your concern. The thing is, if the MEA or the Indian embassy in Sweden pressed this issue further, it might get resolved quickly. I was already unsure how the police processed these things there, but someone from the comments told me on DM(who told me that they work with the police in another city in Sweden), that these issues take months to resolve sometimes, and that I should keep my hopes low. However, if the Indian embassy or the MEA pressed it further, the chances would get better. So that's what I'm trying to ask here, if anyone has any contacts in the embassy. I've been trying to tag them on Twitter since yesterday, but I have received no replies at all. Uppsala university is ranked one of the top 100 universities in the world. What shit are you doing against western racism other than shitting on random Redditor? Also , why did you equate sharia law which is proposed by Muslim extremists to Muslim immigrants? So sorry to hear about what you're going through. Will retweet for better reach. Hope he's safe now & recovers soon. Yes, he was taken to the hospital yesterday. He is now at his friend's place. I have asked him to report this to the university authorities as well. We're trying our best to get the embassy involved, which might really help push the issue... If that doesn't work, I'll also try contacting the Swedish media as you suggested. Thank you for your concern and your advice, really appreciate it. Well yes. Justice is a slow turning wheel. Sweden isn't really after \"swift justice\" but justice. It _will_ take months and that is if they have a suspect but it sounds like in this case they don't. So I would lower my expectations of that and focus on self care for you and your brother. This should be your main focus and let the authorities do what they can. Hi, Swede here. It's a toxic sub that one, and I'm sorry that you got such awful responses. I'm even more sorry to hear about your brother. Is he doing okay despite the horrible attack? Has he been able to report it to the police? (if not, his dorm neighbours might be able to help). Do you know where in Uppsala this happened? I live here, and it is usually a very peaceful city. I'm really, really sorry that this has happened and I wish your brother a quick recovery. Can't you read the post? She will Man that is so fucking sad . These same people would cry all of India bad if there was rumor of such an incident . I hope u and your brother get through it . 🙏 100% me bro . And I thought any sane person would respond similarly. When i saw what he posted i was baffled . contact u/St_Broseph At least I'm not shitting on some other group (who are also victims of Western racism) as a response to Western racism against Indians. You seriously think Sharia is going to be imposed in Sweden lmao Swedish khatre mein hai. Muslim immigrants aren't even a sizable chunk of Swedish population, let alone the much smaller subset of braindead extremists among them. Fear mongering at its finest, the same fear mongering that Western racists use against Indians and other immigrants by calling them terrorists, rapists, criminals etc. I understand you trying to help but I don’t think people have enough time to fake about their brother almost dyeing. At least they are not crying sharia in between a conversation where it literally has 0 relevance in . >why did you equate sharia law which is proposed by Muslim extremists to Muslim immigrants? Because this kind of rhetoric is used to discriminate against all muslims/ perceived muslims . Racists , bigots , neo-nazis , ultra nationalist , religio fascists won't ask u if u are an extremist or not . Is he in the hospital? Where did this happen? I can see 2 updates from Polisen for August 5. Let me know if he needs any help. We live in Uppsala and have a huge community here. this post is highly suspicious as an assault or attempted murder it would have been published on the police website(https://polisen.se/aktuellt/polisens-nyheter/?lpfm.loc=Uppsala%20l%C3%A4n) i see no such event being published. there is one post about a robbery/assault in kvarngärdet but there are no student dorms there and you mentioned no valuables were taken. (the person in the post lost cash) for the Indians on this subreddit im deeply sorry if there has been a negative tone. im swedish and generally people dont talk about india or indians at all here. swedes are not that aware about the goings on in india overall. i consider this persons submission to be a bit suspicious considering that he has a divisive tone coupled with the fact that i cant find anything in the local news or in the police website about this incident. I think one of the safest country for indians is USA. Though it is not a utopia but still better than european mofos. It's not safe in Europe for Indians right now unfortunately. Anti-Immigrant (read anti-brown) sentiments are at an all-time high. Even a friendly country like Ireland has become incredibly racist in the past 2 years. Indian students should really reconsider going to Europe for studies right now. It's only going to get worse. that's fucked man Even UK which has a lot of subcontinent population have a lot of protests going on :( It's always good to see any good people. To balance out some bad . Not true. It is just that there are a lot of people who are not fit to be working there. Hi. I'm sorry that this post seems suspicious to you, but I've provided the details to the people who said they could help in the DMs. Also, a police case was registered yesterday. for what its worth i hope your brother recovers well and that they find the perpetrator. Sweden has been dangerous for the last 15 years. You are talking about crime statistics. I am referring to the actual head of organised crime group Foxtrot who is from Uppsala. That’s awesome but the lower level folks don’t understand all this. Racism is quite rampant in Sweden unfortunately and most folks just ignore it. Bhai - aise Kuch na hona. Name and shame. Bhai ka video nikal Hindi mein , usko poori Kahani batane ko bol Do you have a Police Report number? Woh daal video mein, Sweden ka Jo ambassador hai India mein unko tag Kar - pooch tere desh mein yeh sab kyu ho Raha hai mere Bhai k saath - tere saath Aisa ho india mein toh Sweden police ko tag Kar, university ko tag Kar Modi ko tag Kar , RaGa ko bhi Kar You need to put this post in /r/Indians_StudyAbroad - stay safe from Sweden People should realize these things about being abroad i am sorry to hear about what happened to your brother and undersrand your feeling of despair. I am a Swede living in Uppsala and can perhaps give some clarity. Far right-wing politics has increased a lot in Sweden over the last years but is not directed towards Indian citizens at all. Hate crimes towards immigrants in Sweden is quite rare in Sweden and the vast majority of violent crimes here are done by people who are 1st or 2nd generation immigrants from MENA. it's way more probable that it was a criminal immigrant or a mental sick person that comitted the crime then some Swedish nationalist. As some one eller here mentioned the Police in Uppsala update their webpage with basic information about crimes that has been comitted and there is no info there about an attempted murder in the last days so make sure yiur brother has reporter the crime to the Police. I find this weird because (I can’t find, please share if you have): 1. Any news article big or small mentioning this in any newspaper. UNT.se would for sure publish something on this. 2. The Swedish police didn’t publish anything in this either (which they essentially do for anything) at polisen.se/aktuellt 3. There’s nothing posted on this in either of the bigger either formal/informal Facebook-groups. Sweden isn’t a dangerous place for anyone really. Especially not in Uppsala which is a progressive student city. That being said racism occurs such as in any place of the world, but that there was a coordinated group of people or single person attacking someone is highly unlikely. My only thought of why he could possibly be attacked is because of he was mistaken (simply being in the wrong place and wrong time when some drug fused teenagers) were suppose to attack some gang member or something. Anyways if you have any more to add pls do Lmao this is probably the biggest lie told on Reddit to this day 😂 Contact some media person to report it. if possible, post pictures of the wound or stitches, alot of media(social media) picks up issues when there is some pictures/videos to show (sadly) I don't have any news link, but I have all the details of the assault. I was on call with him when the incident happened, and a report was filed with the police yesterday. Really sorry that this happened to your brother. I hope he is getting necessary medical attention and that culprit is caught soon. And I, saw your tweet. They are unfortunately very sparse in details. You might need to be a bit more descriptive, alsi consider adding an image of the wounds. (Although it sounds crude, might help to get traction). Along with, politicians also tag journalists. And if you are adding tags of accounts in the tweet, add it at the end of the tweet or if you are adding it at the beginning, add a dot before. Starting the tweet with a mention means thag Twitter will treat it just as a conversation between two profile and the tweet won't come naturally on people's feed. I live in Denmark and this is the most ridiculous take I’ve ever seen. The country is extremely safe. The only crimes are generally committed by drug gangs Bruh That being said I just made the assumption that he said he was attacked in Uppsala since you wrote that he was a student at the university here… Sorry about your brother. I live in Denmark and we hear about stuff happening in Sweden. Most of the crime is by drug gangs, mostly by immigrants taken in who did not integrate into society (the fault of that lies on many different entities). I’ve personally never heard of such a thing as a hate crime here to be honest and people blowing up about racism haven’t even lived here. I can’t say it doesn’t make exist, but it’s quite rare and unlikely Attacker description? Yes, thank you. I have added the pictures of the injuries to my tweet. If I'm being honest there is nothing to resolve. If this was a hate crime there is nothing much that can be done. Best you can do is to make sure that he takes care of himself and possibly also file a police complaint and hope for the best. He was attacked from behind suddenly, and directly on the head. He was almost blank the moment he hit him, so he couldn't get a good look. Yes, he studies in Uppsala University and stays in flogsta. that is not true at all, uppsala is a very safe student city that has barely any incidents, especially compared with malmö or other cities. it is probably one of the safest places you can be. this is a horrible situation but acting like theres ”kurdish gangs” ruling one of the most chill cities to live in is ridiculous Thank you. This incident happened last night at around 2:20 AM IST. I was on a phone call with him when this happened. >Let me know if he needs any help. We live in Uppsala and have a huge community here. Surely, thank you again for the support. Not so sure about that. The racism you read about in the news has always been there. Also, Indians are very respected in Sweden and the racism issues you find in Sweden is in almost every case related to muslims from the MENA region. Praying for your brothers safety. Absolutely man. I once went to the Indian embassy in Paris and it was the same inefficient a$$holes like any other govt office People pay taxes and they are entitled to be angry. I am sorry for your brother and I wish him a speedy recovery, but there's no amount of pressure that could be put by MEA or the Indian Embassy on Swedish police for this to be resolved quicker. The police in Sweden isn't 'ruled' by politicians etc, the department of foreign affairs and the police aren't going to help each other with stuff like this Thats just no correct. At least in Germany Indians are very welcomed as hard-working folks. I have an indian colleague working with me and I asked specifically if he experienced racism in his 5 years working in Germany. His answer was that he never experienced it on the street, but he suspects it in a few encounters with officials, but that could be due to the language barrier, too – according to him. Ask someone to file a police report immediately. If he was attached in the campus, contact campus security. Also try reaching out to University student council. It seems like any other avg uni tbh. 80pc acceptance is ordinary. Anyone who's not a retard and has good money can go it seems. You didn't have to hype it up. My question is answered. No country in this world is safe. So sorry for your brother man. You are the one talking about districts. Now you want to change to which city has the most dangerous leader? Who by the way is not residing in Uppsala anymore, he is hiding in turkey. Tell him to contact a lawyer in Sweden Tell him to talk to a lawyer.. Simple Tweeting would not help Hi, I’m Swedish and work as an investigator for the police authority here. There is nothing the politicians or embassy can do to press the issue further, never mind resolve it quicker. I’ve lived in India and I’m aware that the bureaucracy is different there, but the Swedish administration is much more resistant to outside influences, so the best thing to do is to wait and let the investigation proceed. The judicial process takes time, whatever the motive of the assailant. At this point I’m sure they’re primarily trying to get physical evidence and tie the assailant to the crime, but sadly this will take its time. Realistically pressure from Indian authorities or diplomats will have zero effect on the police investigation. That's just not how things work here, the police are fully independent. At this point you make sure your brother is safe and then you trust the process. One of the best unis in the world, T100. Way better infra and research programs than any Indian college. Retards like you won’t even make to top 200. Why would someone not go to a country that’s 10x more developed than India and have less fucks like you? It’s better ranked than every college in India and has 10x better infrastructure and facilities. People like you won’t go there coz honestly who wants a brain dead fuck but others do. Try leaving your room once. A swedish racist is going to see any brown/ person of color and assume they are muslim He was mentally unstable from being on drugs. Thats no excuse for murder but it was no hate crime. He had also been threatening his friend and after being arrested he attacked his lawyer. This post is absurd and the comments and upvotes deeply disturbing. There are tons of immigrants from all over the world in Sweden, and no-one will bat an eye if a person looked and behaved Indian. While there are surely racist attitudes, there are none of the riots as seen in the UK. It is impossible too say what happened in this specific case, whether there was a prior altercation, mistaken identity - or perhaps a rare case of actual racist attack. But an Indian person dressing and behaving exactly as if home in India would be in no greater danger than walking a street in India. @OP, if you do not get any response from the police, please do contact local media. A hate crime, attempted murder, would be a major news event in Uppsala. She did. Apparently some people were being racist under that post so she deleted it. Hey, I have friends studying in Uppsala University. Try r/tilsverige this is the official sub for people in moving/living in Sweden. And also try r/uppsala Yeah? Just say I’m Indian! Problem solved lol As a swede myself who grew up in Uppsala and studies at their uni, I will add that racism leading to violent hate crimes is not at all common here - it’s simply just not how our racism (which nonetheless undeniably exists) tend to manifest itself. Especially in Uppsala, this strikes me as a very very unique case. Whatever violence like this we see here is almost always related to some sort of organized crime activity. This is of course not to say that the victim was related to crime - sometimes innocent people get caught up in it. However, all this does of course not mean that this being a hate crime can be ruled out. And I can reassure you that the people who matter (police/investigators) won’t rule it out. Unfortunately india have really bad name outside India. Most indians are unruly, unhygienic outside as well Man I'm scared and ashamed of being an Indian atp Why doesn’t he just returns to India? \\ I don't understand, why should the foreign minister or anyone be concerned about this? \\ Did he ask him before going to pursue masters somewhere in the world? \\ I feel it's useless to complain after taking some steps for your own career and later asking help from MEA and blaming them if they don't entertain youe personal query. Bro the external affairs does not exists to solve personal problems. If someone has a problem, he/she should leave the place and come back to their home. What's the big issue? \\ What do you expect exactly? Do you want a personal bodyguard from the external affairs ministry for your safety? What can they do exactly lol? I don’t know if it’s joke response. Embassies which are under the ambit of external affairs are also exist to help Indian people outside India. No one here asking them to be bodyguards So what exactly could be done? \\ Wouldn't it be much easier to just fly back to India instead of tweeting about it? Why? If an indian attacks someone you are ashamed. When an indian is attacked then you are ashamed. When will you be proud? I don't understand why you were horrified by those comments. Being violently attacked because of your race is very rare. Hope your brother heals quickly! Well. If mainland Europe is bad. UK is bad. And Canada is bad. Where is it fine Please don't tell middle east. I was born there and they have always been bigoted. I have a Canadian Indian family member whose quoted salary suddenly increase when she mentioned she was a Canadian citizen not Indian. Ikr. What is there to be ashamed of. Oh nO I GoT AttAcKEd I FeeL So AshAmED As An InDiaN All My FaulT for MErElY EXIStInG Now they will say. YEaH But ItS NoT ToP 3. OnLy StAnFOrD MIT AnD YalE CounT. For these people it's all or nothing. Then they claim we are not respected, when we wont respect ourselves no one would respect us. This is the fact of the world. One of my friends is working in Uppsala. Hit me up. I can connect you with him. It’s the job of the local Indian mission to assist Indians abroad - else why have the Indian mission in the first place? He isn’t asking for a pakora stall to be started by MEA for him. He is asking about a physical safety issue. Rasicsm and fascism is rising in the entire world . Whereas in India it’s openly rising modi and these na#*i militias that hunt Muslims , bhuddist and other ,,untouchables,, i am sorry for you friend . But it’s a global problem . Are but Jaishankar is giving it back to reporters and foreign diplomats on Instagram reels and YouTube shorts. I thought we were winning and Vishwa guru already . Or try contacting paw paw, war rukwa dete hai aaj kal suna hai The cops need to be informed, if your brother is not able to now, at least ask one of his friends to file a police report. Why do you think the embassy is set up there? To send ministers on vacations? If something happens to you in india, why do you go to hospital or police? Do you ask them before you step out? How brainfucked and dumb can you be lmao Isn’t Sweden a welcoming nation? Have the politics and related situations changed the climate there? (Honest curious question, you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to) wtf man, what about south east asia? japan, korea are bad for us for sure but singapore, malaysia? Are they good? It's possible that he slipped and fell backwards. Sometimes it looks like assault. I am really sorry OP, hope you find the help you need. But I can't help but notice the moniker of your twitter hanlde. I may be completely wrong here. May be you could have atleast created a better sounding handle to take your tweets seriously. I'm not sure what exactly you're expecting the embassy to do here. Your brother has gotten medical care, the police have been informed and there is now no urgent risk to life or limb. At this point, realistically the only thing the embassy can do is have a photo op with your brother and maybe use it to create a diplomatic ruckus, which they won't because it's pointless to blow up an isolated incident. I understand that at this moment you would feel highly charged and that there must be something that someone could do in order to trigger a crime patrol style investigation and catch the perpetrators overnight, but honestly the best thing to do now is to leave the police to do their jobs in peace. I live in the EU, but not specifically Sweden and I know that in general there's no \"influencing/pressuring\" of police that will work like in India. At this point, you really just need to be patient and let the police do their jobs. Sweden, like many Western European countries, has been too welcoming in the past. With a lot of newcomers sticking to their \"home\" culture instead of adopting the culture of the country that welcomed them... something that is now sadly starting to cause problems. That's what a muslim from MENA would say Sir. >I don’t think people have enough time to fake No. The commentor above makes sense Hate crime or not, is he safe. Is the embassy un willing to help in a way that ensures he has well wishes around him? They’re experiencing an immigration crisis like many European countries. A while ago the crisis was so bad large parts of major cities were no-go zones that police wouldn’t enter, because gangs of youths from a certain demographic would try dropping **grenades** on police vehicles - Not just once but for nearly a decade You’re delusional Sir 😂 You put up a post a twitter and tag the embassy and PMO,MEA etc you will get a response Keep your guard up bro as it could be a hate crime. That leech could be targeting Indians !? Refugee crisis. They were so welcoming that they welcomed their problems too. Good for you. I am Danish and I remember having to help an Indian colleague who had been in an accident. He was grateful for my help and later reached out to thank me. He told me his extended family back in India had started a hysterical social media storm hating on both Denmark *and* their own Indian diplomats for not booking a flight back to India. I simply don't understand this Indian entitlement. Yes, accidents and violent assaults happen even in countries like Denmark and Sweden. No, we are not going to make it a top bureaucratic priority. My Indian colleague was back at work after 6 weeks and imagine he got a better free recovery treatment here than whatever his family wanted him to do in India (but only if Denmark or those poor Indian diplomats paid up). In that case, tag opposition leaders, the embassy of Sweden in India and its ambassador, and a few journalists. Great comment. Also mention what help do you need exactly from the embassy. Mention every detail. Who are you? Racism is not that rampant. This thing happened in Flogsta, it’s way more likely it happened due to drug-related gangs. Yes, it's better to get shot at than being attacked by a knife. :/ Lol. Check the stats before talking outta your ass. Its not even in top 100. And FYI I did study at a place ranked miles ahead of this one. Or most others globally. So sit down my friend. It’s not personal query, it is a government’s job and duty to protect its citizens or at the very least assist them support them specially in foreign land. By your logic if a person who owns a jewellery showroom in India gets robbed and critically injured he should not get police involved because he didn’t consult the government before opening up his business, pathetic. Don’t be so apologetic and saviour of the government that you loose sight of their responsibilities and duties. You're such a loser. They don't want any diplomat to make it top priority, they just want empathy and a human response from them. If they're incapable of that, we should rethink why they're even there Yes, judging by a lot of responses throughout the night, you might be right. But the helplessness of us being away from him at such a time, and the embassy executive talking to us in such a rude way(she didn't show the least bit of empathy, it was infuriating), I felt like maybe something could be done by the embassy people. >but honestly the best thing to do now is to leave the police to do their jobs in peace. Many people in the DMs told me that I should keep my hopes low of this being solved. So, this further fuelled our anxiety, as the attack happened so close to his living area. I was on the phone with him when this happened. His statement has been recorded by the police, another person who witnessed it through his window has also given their statement. >Being violently attacked because of your race is very rare. So, not zero? So if your own family member lets say your mother, ends up violently assaulted in a foreign country you would not move heaven and hell for her? Show some compassion. This isnt an ethnic ‘quirk’, stop making it political. OPs own brother ended up nearly dead. According to you there's no racism against South Asians? Thank you for your concern. He is now with his friends who are taking care of him. If your friend has any connections with the local authorities, just ask them to push the issue. Again, thanks a lot for the gesture. >Ah, white people being openly racist to Indian/South-asian people. Nothing new. It's the same story in all western countries' subs. Its the same here, lets not take the moral high ground, plenty of times we have all seen when the victim in India is from one particular religion and attackers from another a lot of indians come together to say the following: 1. There is no proof that it was religious motivation 2. What about Kashmiri pandits did you'll complain then? 3. It is our internal matter other countries should not interfere etc etc etc. it has nothing to do with skin color or any other thing, some humans are just pieces of shit Thank you! But Hate crimes are not really a thing here. Especially against Indians. Indians don't really face racism even. So, I don't think it's fair to jump to conclusions like that. I also know that neighbourhood really well. It is easily one of the safest. Thank you! But Hate crimes are not really a thing here. Especially against Indians. Indians don't really face racism even. So, I don't think it's fair to jump to conclusions like that. I also know that neighbourhood really well. It is easily one of the safest. Racists can’t tell the difference between Indians and Middle Easterners. For example, after 9/11, a guy was going around attacking Middle Easterners and shot an Indian. What ? Why not publicly talk about it and put pressure on police through external affairs ministry.. Imagine this happens to a Swedish woman in India , it would be viral . Means it could be that , pig might be targeting Indians Be safe!!! Even if people don’t hate Indians specifically, it’s not like the average person will be able to tell apart an Indian from a Middle Easterner. True, but it doesn't mean we can't criticise their culture. Like, we are free to criticise ours. It's literally ranked 103 globally with 16 nobel prize laureates. Get your head our of your ass and start reading. Your Indian unis are miles behind these research intensive unis. Try leaving your room once in a while.. \"Miles ahead\" my foot go back to your shithole Agreed I appreciate your concerns, and I am really grateful for it. But let's not jump to conclusions, and create unwarranted confusion and/or fear. It doesn't help the situation in any way. It is indeed a violent, despicable crime. But we do not know the motivation. We don't know much about the perpetrator to come to that conclusion. Let's for a second assume that it wasn't a hate crime. But the perpetrator was arrested and he/she gets punished, and there motivation was not racism. Then you have maligned the whole country for no reason. But the ill-will that gets created between the people of two countries doesn't go away. If anything, that in itself might perpetuate hate between people. As they say in Hindi \"Thanda dimaag\" is what we need now. And let the police here do their thing. Why do you think the embassy is set up there? To send ministers on vacations to foreign countries? If something happens to you in india, why do you go to hospital or police? Do you ask them before you step out for do something? I will give you a realistic reply. Police in any country are usually lazy, even here in my country unless they know the case can be solved without effort they won't put any effort. Or unless there is media attention. Now to get media attention, all you need is get some cctv footage and one email to them with news article link from police along with footage will kick up in Indian news channels. Ask if your brothers friends can visit the location and acquire footage from anywhere nearby. That's your best bet to initiate media attention. So sorry to hear this. Do you need any other type of support (normal Swede offering help) I live close by and might be able to help with errands and stuff if you are alone Agreed I did. I agree with the sentiment. But the blanket statement \"Indian Embassy is the worst place in every country caught me off guard\". That's an opinion so I wanted to know more. You took this chance to talk to me like I'm ignorant. I have now explained my stance. Hope this clears up things for you, idiot. Facts No, this is simply not true. There are about 20 areas where the police have a hard time fulfilling their purpose, however the areas are not no-go zones. To the contrary, those areas often have a quite high police presence. The police do not now nor did they previously call the areas no-go zones. They are called \"vulnerable areas\". Yes unfortunately Indian embassies and consulates generally don't have a great response to pretty much anything. Yep. Even in OP's post in r/Sweden, people were asking what exactly he wanted help with since the police is already investigating the case. So giving more details and asking for specific things that OP needs help with will allow people to respond accordingly. Otherwise, all others will be able to do is offer sympathies. As far as MEA is concerned, they should be taking up the issue regardless though, since OP's brother is an Indian citizen. Hopefully, OP will make a new tweet that will gain some traction. all we can help you is by retweeting your tweet for now. i request everyone to do it. Yes, thank you! I go bonkers every time I hear about the so-called no-go zones, there is no such thing! And these 20 vulnerable areas are in all of Sweden, not part of any one city. There's no city where \"large parts\" are to be avoided. On the contrary, some of these areas are quite nice, like Gottsunda. Worst thing that happened to me there was that someone accidentally locked my bike instead of theirs. I waited ten minutes, a guy and his friends came, and he was absolutely mortified (and his friends beyond amused) that he had put a lock on the wrong bike. =) When did it happen? I can't find anything about it in the news. [local newspaper ](https://unt.se/lokalt/uppsala) There is literally no mention of this on the Swedish police website (where they mention all serious crimes like this) and there are no mention of this whatsoever on any Swedish news site that I can find. This is very strange, that never happens with violent crimes. I don't want to mistrust you OP, but either ut seems like this wasn't reported to the police properly or at all, or it is some kind of influence operation to create a negative view of Sweden. Again I don't want mistrust you, but why we have to be suspicious is because Russia launches these operations against Sweden all the time, and it's very strange that this allegedly attempted murder is not mentioned in any news site or at the police website. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, I just find it very strange there's no reporting on this. But if this happened to your brother it sounds horrible and I'm sorry it happened to him. I hope it will be resolved. I'm sorry this happened to your brother / Swede This happened at around 22:50 CET, on 8th of August, it was around 2:20 of 9th here in India. It happened in flogsta, near sernanders vag 1 building only, where my brother currently lives. There are no police reports from that time frame Dude. I don't know why there are no reports on the website, but the report was filed on the day of the attack itself. There's a restaurant in the building where my brother stays(sernanders vag), where he managed to reach after the attack. The owner of the restaurant was the one who called the police and the ambulance. Hi, sorry for the late response. Yes, the incident was reported to the police asap. This is what he could recall: Yes that makes sense. I was walking to ICA and was on call with my brother. This guy was standing near building 7 gate, I didn't really take a good look at him. As soon as I crossed him, he came up behind me and attacked me. I don't remember much after that, he hit me on the back of my head, probably multiple times and I was instantly disoriented and dizzy. All I could do was scream very loud. I remember him saying do not scream or I'll hit you again, I don't remember much after that just that he left and then I somehow got up and reached the building 1 restaurant where the owner helped and called the police and the ambulance The incident happened in flogsta, near sernanders vag, when he went to buy some snacks and was on call with me. This is what an eye witness saw from his window, who has also given his statement to the police: Yes it all happend very fast, this is from my perspective...try to remember yours too. I heard loud shouts, I rushed to the window. You were on the ground, and screaming and he was attack you and kicking you. He had something in his hand. The shouts were loud. Then he threatened you \"if you scream like that I will kill you\". Then he hit you on the head and kicked you. Then he walked away. Change your news provider and remember that hate is color blind. It's awful, just awful. I lived in house 7 for over five years, so I know the area really well. It's so strange everything, I've never heard of anything like it. Flogsta is like 95% students and 5% families with children, and it's really not a dangerous place (on the contrary, I really had the best time in my life there). Don't know how many nights I've strolled around in the area. I'm happy to hear that the police has been contacted! Don't expect it to go quickly (except many months at best) (and as I think others have pointed out, no embassy or politician can influence the investigation), but it will be taken seriously. And great that there's one (or more) eye witnesses. I've read through comments in this thread, and seen suggestions about cctv - very unlikely that there's any, Sweden is not big on that stuff, particularly around residential areas (and extra particularly around building gates, I don't think that is legal actually). However, house 8 has a rather good view over house 7, so it's quite possible that someone who heard it might have caught it on cell phone video. The downside is that it is still summer, so there's very few people in Flogsta at the moment. I'm sure your brother is being well cared for at the hospital, akademiska sjukhuset is great. And I really hope your brother (and you as well) will get some clarity in what happened, I understand that it must feel horribly uncomfortable for you both to be so far apart and for him to live close to where these events took place. This random Swede wish all the best to you guys. No, there are bigots everywhere Investigations take time its a matter of doing things right. You cant speed up an investigation. I think it might take up to a year before it even goes to trial. This is a horrible thing to happen and I understand that you want to help your brother but it being hard being so far away but the police and authorities will surely do their best. I too love spreading misinformation online OP please post in the india study abroad sub. It's important to raise awareness. Indians absolutely face racism, it’s just more subtle and non-physically violent. /Swede How are these comments \"openly racist\"? Thats such a ridicilous stretch. They are literally just saying it's quite a leap to jump to the conclusion of a hate crime not having any more information. That last comment was vile though Thank you, that's what I've been trying to say for all this time. Truth be told, even I don't know to what extent the embassy or the ministry could help, but the fact that this happened, and there was such an apathetic reply from the embassy, it made us worry even more. Sometimes, all a person needs to hear is that they're not alone in this, and that their government wants to help them in at least some way. I know trying to reach the MEA or embassy officials may seem like a desperate step, but I don't know what else I can do from here. Yes, I've been told by many people that such investigations take a lot of time and I shouldn't get my hopes up. I'll paste my response to a similar question here: Truth be told, even I don't know to what extent the embassy or the ministry could help, but the fact that this happened, and there was such an apathetic reply from the embassy, it made us worry even more. Sometimes, all a person needs to hear is that they're not alone in this, and that their government wants to help them in at least some way. I know trying to reach the MEA or embassy officials may seem like a desperate step, but I don't know what else I can do from here. I mean, I'm Swedish so if there's racism, I wouldn't quite know as I'm not subjected to it. My understanding from friends with other backgrounds is that it is overall fine, one rarely encounters open racism and particularly not in the form of violence. The issue might be more subtle, like being discriminated against by having a non-Swedish name. That said, as it is obvious from the Sweden sub, there are some really rotten people with some really rotten views. I don't know where they are in real life, but given that there's a relatively large racist party, it's not an insignificant number of people that secretly hold these views. It is absolutely not acceptable to express racism or any other intolerant behaviour IRL, so I don't know if that's why these people get so vocal about online. I'd like to think that Sweden is still a welcoming nation though and that the vast majority are as repulsed about racism as I am. 🇸🇪 ♥ 🌍 Your edited description makes it clear that it was an attack. It is the only city I know anyone who has been assaulted in. The train station felt very unsafe with groups of immigrants running around and threatining people when I was there last time. Thank you so much for your kind words. >Don't expect it to go quickly (except many months at best) (and as I think others have pointed out, no embassy or politician can influence the investigation) I'll post my response to a similar question like this, since many people have said it: Truth be told, even I don't know to what extent the embassy or the ministry could help, but the fact that this happened, and there was such an apathetic reply from the embassy, it made us worry even more.

I was a bit worried about this. Because he suffered very heavy blood loss, but the hospital staff discharged him that night after the stitches and some routine check up. But his health deteriorated further in the night, he started bleeding again, was disoriented, couldn't talk properly, and was vomiting, according to his friends. He was taken back to the hospital, and this time they kept him for some time. Now, he's with his friends who are taking care of him. Hopefully it'll all be ok. There have been many similar questions, so I'll again post my response from it: Truth be told, even I don't know to what extent the embassy or the ministry could help, but the fact that this happened, and there was such an apathetic reply from the embassy, it made us worry even more.

Islamophobia is a proxy for racism, not vice versa. Don't claim to know how a racist thinks in your aspirational Whiteness. You don't know how You're perceived. Its high time Indians stop being naive about racism. Islamophobia is a proxy for racism, not vice versa. Don't claim to know how a racist thinks in your aspirational Whiteness. You don't know how You're perceived. For white only I think Sweden is becoming extremist terror state. I wonder how these monkeys became developed. Please carry a pepper spray all the time and wear kadda for your protection. Karma will come back to bite these pigs. Instead of going to foreign countries to live as a lower class it better to live India here atleast you have family and friends. I know we have many problems in our country, if we're not going to solve it, who will ?? Racist hate cries are extremely rare in Sweden. Violent crime in general is really low, with the major exception of MENA gangs like, for example, Foxtrot in Uppsala. Anything is possible of course but I'd put my money on OP's brother simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time and being mistaken for someone else who's involved in organised crime. Also, I get that OP is frustrated and feeling helpless but I don't really know what they're expecting from swedish police or the indian embassy considering the attack took place last night. How much investigating can be done in a few hours? Its a reaction that kicks in after the shock in the form of \"what can I do\" and your brother is a foreign national in. Sweden wich its only natural to ask the embassy to make sure one of their citizens are ok. Weird unsensitive reaction from the embassy though. I would personally be frantic if something happened to a loved one abroad Yeah mate.. Relax. Racism in Sweden isn’t rampart. We have fucktards much like all countries but most people do not give a fuck about the colour of your skin as long as you work and adapt to swedish culture. To OP: I am sorry about your brother and I hope they catch the guy who did it. White or Afghan? That would usually be the difference between a hate crime and/or mistaken attempt on someone in the middle of a gang war And you'd rather it be the same? Good luck when you find yourself in an emergency lmao I'm still having trouble understanding how someone can confuse a Kurd/Afghan/Turk with an Indian. They are usually significantly fairer than us and have different facial features. When did I say that I want it to be the same? :/ I'm doing my part trying to change things too. In what way? No, if it has happened once it is not zero. You understood neither what the original commentor was saying nor my reply to them Yeah, white racism and hatred against brown people is at an all time high. It's only going to get a lot worse from here on out. Yeah, I lived in the US in the run up to Trump's election. 2016 and 2017-2018, there was a sudden increase in hostile behaviour towards me. Was traveling in a train in Bay Area, minding my own business. White woman says \"could be terrorist\" and laughs as if it's a joke. Carriage full of white people are just staring at me tensely, no one scolds her. I got off because I did not feel safe. Went to a convenience store late in the night in Colorado, this white woman at the register asks if I am a Muslim or not. Was going through airport security, I'm suddenly pulled aside for \"random checking\" of my shoes............my normal running shoes with nothing obviously wrong with them. By a white TSA officer. White couple passing through at the same time also thought it was weird and gave a look at that officer. Was about to board a plane at the gate, suddenly this African American officer stops me, asks if I'm carrying cash worth thousands of dollars. Also stops this other brown woman and asks if we are together - this woman and I don't know each other, at no point have we interacted or even acknowledged each other's existence. He demands to check my bag or he won't let me on the plane. We literally went through security where they X-rayed my bag and I went through their scanner.......... Came to India, went back to the US. White immigration officer is asking me basic details like name and address, again and again for 10 whole minutes. Simply repeating the same questions again and again and again. At this point I'm wondering if I will be rejected for entry. Other people notice and start to comment. He finally relents and lets me through. Yeah pretty much this. For white people, any person with brown skin = middle eastern = muslim = terrorist Oh absolutely. Yeah white people don't like it when you point out their shitty behaviour Lol, so non-white people must be a carbon copy of white people to be accepted according to you.............funny how you bend over backwards to bootlick and excuse racism. \"country that welcomed them\" - not so much welcoming in general. They don't like the fact that non-white people are immigrating peacefully into their country. That's it. It's not just lately. It's always been the case. It's not just Sweden. All white people have shown their true racist colours. They were always racist. Also the entire world is full of right wing extremist movements, hating on the minorities. Buddhist extremists started murdering Muslims in Myanmar for the past several years.............. \"immigration crisis\" - ah yes, non-white people peacefully coming in = immigration crisis Gotta love when white people panic and go crazy because non-white people wanted to also be there. 103 is still not in top 100. I hope you understand that. I never mentioned any Indian uni. Are you hallucinating bro? I don't understand what's got your panties in a bunch over some random fckin university - did they reject you for the janitor position? What is happening in Sweden !? Its not even in top 100. Lol. What you talking man. Indian news agencies will be the most willing to share horrific details and crimes. Less consequences, less control unlike other nations. Yeah, reality is that humans are shit. A horrible, abusive, psychopathic species. We're not the pinnacle. We are just worms crawling in the mud. Lol no, I have faced plenty of hostility and racism in the USA. Especially since 2016. Actually pakora stall is also important. Won't vote for any party if their MEA doesn't help launch pakora stall in other countries. Technically they do have to register with the government, but yeah you're right. > Why do you think the embassy is set up there? To send ministers on vacations to foreign countries? Lol yes, under BJP this is their only role. To plan Modi's next vacation. I worked with a guy from Carnegie Mellon, he was absolutely trash and incompetent at his job. Hey! I’m an Indian and I live in Uppsala. I’m sorry your brother had to go through this. I’ve DM’ed you in case your brother needs any type of help. I’ve been living in Uppsala for a while and can help with whatever I can and know Ethnicity more clear description of attacker? You are right, they have dropped out the last few years. 140 still isn't bad. It's surprising how a country like Qatar can say \"Hey we organise the world cup, everyone is welcome but this is our country and these are our rules and laws. Stick to those and lets all have fun.\" But as soon as a Western country does or tries the same, it is suddenly racism... My brother was almost blacked out the moment he was hit, he couldn't get a good look at him. Sadly, there aren't even any cameras nearby. How about Pakistani? Essentially no place is completely fine like in India. You will be a second class citizen wherever you go. Dk about Malaysia but Singapore is not that great a place for Indians. I have family living there in well paid white collar professions. They say that Singapore is kind of like Korea in the sense that people will look down on you if you are dark or brown skinned. A lot of owners won’t rent their apartments to Indians. There are also undercurrents of racism and discrimination in the workplace. As far as I know the Chinese are at the top of social hierarchy there and are not very fond of Indians so that might create tension in the workplace that's fucked It is.Singapore is also the only place where I myself encountered racism as a tourist. To answer your original question, US is still the least racist imho. Canada used to be a good until they started experiencing the immigration crisis due to mass migration of poorly qualified Indians. Now people there hate Indians yeah US is the only good country ig Not being racist but Indians in canada going for diploma mills and not following their country's basic rules and creating ruckus is def justified And the witness? A lot many of them don't look Indian at all IMO, except for if you could find a super fair person from Kashmir/the other northern states - that is the only instance I can think of that can bring about some confusion. We are significantly darker than them. What we do match with in body structure and looks are with Bangladeshis instead Bro experienced the average Indian minority experience. He didn't describe the attacker either, except that he was tall and had a heavy voice. I think it's a psychopath... Would be good to catch him before he moves on to actual murder The people from Singapore actually complain about the same thing. Not the diploma mill part but the creating ruckus part. That’s why a lot of them don’t rent apartments out to Indians because apparently Indians with their chalta hai attitude damage the apartment and don’t leave it in a good condition after they leave. Damn, I see I have heard a lot of people in france do the same, not because they are racist but due to the repeated experiences like this Yes, people do this in the US too. But they’re not very direct about it because they could easily very sued there Damn The number of stereotypes due to a few people is costing us Thats not true at all . Lol . I know many who work nights in nursing homes , to help people. Who want to drop of but don’t do it . Because of their patients . Any updated regarding the P4 if they have talked about it? And if the police has gone out with a statement? I haven’t been able to see or hear anything. I live in Uppsala and has been all my life Hi. I confirmed with the Radio guys, a short segment was aired on p4. However, the police hasn't updated anything on the website yet."
