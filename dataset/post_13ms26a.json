He mentions itâ€™s 21st century and both the kids are adults by age and are fully qualified by age to take independent decisions. \n\nHe also says that even inside Hindu religion, earlier, there used to be so many barriers towards marriage among different castes, but now those barriers have become almost non-existent and hence even inter-religious marriages should also stop being a taboo.

What did he expect, he's in a party of incels.\n\nI remember chaddis were violently protesting a consensual Hindu-Muslim marriage when Siddharamaiah was CM in 15/16. He personally intervened, provided heavy police security outside the marriage venue and put the violent chaddis in jail.",

        "You reap what you sow !!\n\nHatred will only results in more hatred. To all Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian out there love knows no boundaries. It is futile to oppose interfaith marriage if both man and woman are agrees with it. A Muslim girl can marry a Hindu boy, a Hindu girl can marry a Christian and so on.",
        "Reading in news that wedding has been cancelled for now.",

        "Agreed \n\nBut the thing is it's not easy now, damage is done . I have fallen for a girl but i often overthink the future possibilities of me being put in jail on accusations of love jihad if suppose the girls family is not happy\n\nI am only 20, Engineering first year and although I am an atheist (my family too) legally we all still are muslims",

        "Btw he was talking about Ankita Bhandari case. What happened to that case? is the case suppressed?",
        "Technically, that's not a bad thing. I doubt that the BJP will ever decline in power drastically. They've pretty much embedded themselves into Indian politics by now.\n\nA more realistic future is for them to gradually become more progressive as some of the more outdated ideologies get phased out with time. \n\nIsn't it better if BJP becomes more progressive with time rather than staying the way they are? That way we'll have more options to choose from.",
        "BJP cannot decline in power simply because of human nature. All countries have an entho-religious nationalist group, that gains power every few years. Arab Springs brought in pure Islamist government overturning secular but undemocratic rule.
