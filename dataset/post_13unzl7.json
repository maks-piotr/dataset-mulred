        "Okay please guide me I am naive. Isn't gender natural and biological. Like yeah you can choose your sexuality which accordingly to me is like your sexual preference with whom you wish to marry, make a family and even be physical. I respect trans people and there is a whole lot of biology behind this that my small brain can't understand but what is this ? Like at the best you are Male, Female, Trans good ? But now like how many genders are there ? Is gay, lesbian also gender like we identify are gender based on sexual preference?",
        "I have a idea that when there is a contest were there are separate competition for men and women like cricket or boxing that time division should be done on the basis of biological sex no matter what you identify yourself as.",
        "Isn't that how it already is?",
        "I will try my best to explain to you.\n\n[Biological] sex, gender and sexuality are three completely different things.\n\nSex: Basically what you have between your legs. Can be changed after undergoing \"sex reassignment surgery\". Male/Female.\n\nGender: How you look, view yourself, behave, act, etc. Man/Woman. It's a social thing.\n\nSexuality: It defines who you are attracted to. Homosexuality, Heterosexuality and Bisexuality. (There are pansexual and asexual too).\n\nNow regarding trans, there are two types of people, Cisgender and Transgender.\n\nCisgender: Those having the same gender since their birth. Most people don't use this prefix. When you say you're a man or a woman, you typically mean cis-man or cis-woman.\n\nTransgender: Those having different genders than what they were during birth. Trans-man/Trans-woman.\n\nSo, if you're biologically a female but feel like a man trapped inside a woman's body, you can become a transgender man from a cisgender woman. Your sexuality (your attractions) do not have anything to do with this.\n\n\nI'm a gay man. That means I'm a man attracted to other cute men lol.",
        "Surprisingly good decision.",
        "Very rudimentary explanation because this is actually a very complex and nuanced topic and humanity/society/medicine is relatively new to addressing it because it was so rarely talked about.\n\nThere are 3 things you are talking about -\n\n1. Biological sex - depending on the chromosomes etc.\n\n2. Gender identity - depending on psychological \"stuff\" which we are still studying\n\n3. Sexual identity - based on preferences\n\nIt's also very possible that all 3 are related (almost always, biological sex defines gender identity, and this in turn informs attraction to the opposite sex). But there are cases of outliers for all 3.\n\nEg - a person born female might have a rare condition of having underdeveloped male reproductive organs internally (hermaphroditism). This can cause medical complications and hormonal issues.\n\nThese persons dealing with anatomical difficulties are called intersex.\n\nNext, a person born female might have \"gender dysphoria\" and identify themselves as a man. This usually leads to psychological distress which in turn causes physiological symptoms because of stress.\n\nSo dealing with this (via gender reassignment or counselling etc.) makes them trans gender.\n\nSexual identity is something that we are a bit more familiar with - gay, lesbian, bi etc.\n\nBut they aren't mutually exclusive (eg. A person might be born male, is never felt like a male and always associated themselves as a woman, but was sexually attracted to other woman). So it's pretty confusing and complex.\n\nIf any of the above points are incorrect I hope someone can correct me because I learnt most of this just a few months back.",
        "Too late! India already has a sizeable population of religious nuts and homophobes who don't seem to grasp the simple concept of \"Live and Let Live\". I have no idea how a person, who simply wants to choose what their gender identity is, affects anyone else in the society and yet people cannot just let them do what they want to.",

        "So if I identify as a woman am I entitled to what's being offered to women",
        "Lol. Not in the US. Lia Thomas, who literally has a penis and enjoys the distinct athletic advantages of natural testosterone, competes as a woman.",
        "And to add to that, a trans person can be gay/queer/bisexual etc even after their reassignment surgery. For example, if someone transitions from being a man to a woman, most of the time they do it because they feel like they don't belong in their own body and their gender dysphoria (not because they want to get with the opposite gender, which a lot of our movies depict as). They can still be attracted to a female after transitioning, if they feel the same way before transitioning.",
        "Depends on what you consider offered to women, and the country you are in.\n\nThere's a difference depending on how far along you are in transition, I think. \n\nSomeone who has been medically transitioning - especially if they started as a young adult, as soon as they are legally and medically able to and/or was on puberty blockers - can in most cases be indistinguishable from someone born female. \n\nOf course, they wouldn't be able to bear children or have menses, but I'm pretty sure external sexual organs can be reconstructed to resemble a cis woman.\n\nThe question about transgender athletes in sports is being debated - that too, I think, depends on how far along the transition is. \n\nYou can't have a trans man who has been undergoing hormone replacement therapy for years compete against cis women just because he was born with a vagina.\n\nLegally speaking, I don't know whether in India you will be able to get the posts reserved for women. I think there's a specific reservation category for transgender people, I'm not sure.",
        "You're welcome! Asexuality is just as valid. I personally feel there should be more awareness about it.",
        "I think you're mixing up gender, sex and sexual orientation.  \nGender is a spectrum and not binary, and usually has more to do with cultural norms expression and expectation. It doesn't equate to sex.   \nSex is more to do with your body. We used to correlate that to the sexual organ you have, or your set of chromosome, but as science develop we identified a lot of ''edge case''. For example a person who is a cis-woman through all her life may turns out to have a set of XY chromosome, but the receptor that capture testosterone hormones didn't work properly, or people with different set of chromosomes than just the ''usual'' XX or XY.   \n\n\nsexual orientation is just who you are attracted to. It is completely non-binary. It can go from straight, to gay, to asexual or pansexual. It's also fluid, with a non-insignificant portion of the population changing their sexual orientation throughout their life.",

        "Depends on if and how far along into HRT they are. Male to female transitioners for example lose muscle mass in the process of HRT, and when on HRT they also usually take steps for testosterone suppression. \n\nTake Lia Thomas, the example a commenter wrongly supplied as a reply to your comment. Her personal best after HRT is over 15seconds slower than before HRT. \n\nIf you are interested in this, there are studies about this topic you can look up.
