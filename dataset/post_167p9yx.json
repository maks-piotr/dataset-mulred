        "I was very happy to watch Asteroid City last Sunday. As a big Wes Anderson fan it was cool finally seeing one of his films on the big screen, even if I didn't love it as much as the rest. \n\nDid any of you get to see it, and if so thoughts?",
        "Scam 2003 (SonyLiv). This Hansal Mehta show is almost as good as the first one. It might get some time getting used to - Abdul Karim Telgi doesn't *look* like the charming hero as Harshad Mehta did. But once you ease up to the character, you realise tha the show offer the same thrill, vanity and captivating experience. \n\nDid you guys enjoy it?",
        "One piece live action. Its not half bad. Its even half good. And I hate live action anime for the record. Its not db evolution at all . This is good enough to get cancelled by netflix and that makes me sad",
        "I watched Suzhal last week and it was great!  Dahaad was also amazing.  Both are on Prime in the US.  Does anyone have a recommendation on more shows like Suzhal?  I especially love small town or village life and the religious festival was a real bonus.  Kantara is another example of a great movie with religious elements and village life.\n\nThis will be pretty vague, but about 3 years ago I saw a cop miniseries that was just bonkers.  It was on Prime or Netflix.  It had supernatural/religious elements and frankly the plot was hard for a westerner to follow.  It was pretty mind-blowing.  One thing that stuck with me is that one detective had chairs and tables but another detective lived on the floor in his place.  Same income but 2 totally different ways of living.  Last year they released season 2.   I can't remember the name.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?"
