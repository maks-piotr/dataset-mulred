    "selftext": "So a couple of days ago, I received a call in an angry tone asking the whereabouts of my son. I however am not married and do not have any children. I understood immediately that this is a scam.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u6juy1td0rc1.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b90d768b5a153a30090496333145d992e1748634\n\nI continued and asked which son are you talking about. He said that \"My son A has raped his co-worker and we have now arrested him. What kind of manners are you teaching your son.\" I started laughing because the name he used for my son was my father's. Scammer got confused and called me instead of my father. He got the names wrong in the relationship which came as a surprise because i have a fairly modern name and my father's is Traditional.  \n\n\nI continued asking what do i have to do. He said send us the bail money and we will then send you the case details. I then asked them to check the names and the relationship again and then hung up.  \nWithin 5 minutes my father received the same call, This time they called and said the correct name. What they didn't know was that I was working from home and my father was sitting next to me.  \n\n\nSo Beware friends because this type of scams are happening a lot these days and we don't know what can happen.  \n\n\nGood Day!",

Recent one was similar to OPs case. The call came on my father’s WhatsApp number, caller was speaking in hindi. Fortunately, i was there right beside father when this happened. He gave me the phone because he doesn’t understand hindi. The caller said he is from CBI and asked where is your son. He did mess up the names like OP mentioned. He was calling my father by my name and asking where’s your son. I asked him couple of times what’s the matter and he kept repeating he is from CBI and wants to know where my son is. Blocked him off immediately, but this is becoming a real pain, and I’m sure a lot of people will panic when the caller claims to be from police, CBI etc",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "So a couple of days ago, I received a call in an angry tone asking the whereabouts of my son. I however am not married and do not have any children. I understood immediately that this is a scam. I continued and asked which son are you talking about. He said that \"My son A has raped his co-worker and we have now arrested him. What kind of manners are you teaching your son.\" I started laughing because the name he used for my son was my father's. Scammer got confused and called me instead of my father. He got the names wrong in the relationship which came as a surprise because i have a fairly modern name and my father's is Traditional. I continued asking what do i have to do. He said send us the bail money and we will then send you the case details. I then asked them to check the names and the relationship again and then hung up. Within 5 minutes my father received the same call, This time they called and said the correct name. What they didn't know was that I was working from home and my father was sitting next to me. So Beware friends because this type of scams are happening a lot these days and we don't know what can happen. Good Day!",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I don't understand if they message a random number or is it based on data leaks? I doubt these are Pakistani's. I assume these are Indians with Pakistani numbers. I dont think its easy for a random person to send money to any Pakistani Bank Account, so they will provide India based Phonepe or Bank Account to recieve money. Hence high possibility of scammer being Indian; but with Pakistani number 🤨 I wonder whose hands our sensitive data is in. He mistook you father's name as your son's name because probably his community writes name in that sequence i.e. father's name and your name swapped. Name sequence is one pain in the ass all over the world. Number was identified by WhatsApp. 92 is the country calling code assigned to Pakistan **by the International Telecommunication Union**. DP is picture of Indian Police Service uniform officer while number is of pakistan. what an asshat. Hence my question : How are scammers acquiring Pakistani SIM Cards? Could be moody in disguise. He needs a lot of money for tge next dance of democracy. You never know So your father is the unwanted culprit? Scam karne ka tareeka thoda kezual tha What? It was sarcasm actually. How did you/ your parents perceive the entire situation?? Shock/ angry? Happy Lol I am the one who first received the call. So as soon as I understood the scam, I called my parents and put the phone on speaker. I used it as a learning opportunity for them. They know what kind of person I am and know that I can never be involved in such things. You don’t need a SIM card. You just need a number to receive an OTP. There are free online services that let you book such numbers Yes, this is very confusing. Agar scammers are Indian toh Pakistani sim qu use kiya? If Pakistani then million aur sawal uththa hai. Good and bad idea. If you have any ooen loophole in aadhar/ pan ( in this pecific case, obviously not) All your money could be hacked away. Yes, we are already in such a situation like in those movies showing if you talk for a minute, your location can be tracked. Instead they have no use for location. But your money. Might seem unbelievable but a delhi advocate lost her fixed deposits, yes fixed deposits in such a way. Maybe they found smartphone vulnerability and hacked in to get otp.( the details given in the newspaper were not clear, so either otp hack of phone or aadhar vulnerability) Dont open such calls at all. If you are a salaried person ,have this psychology- nobody gives a fuck about you and will not call you if you dont have their number saved. But if you are into buisnesses , then obviously unknown nos can call you, cant say dont take on calls of unknown numbers What if there are mule bank accounts just like they have in usa ? They even got ready to garland me. Then I told them it's a scam. OP, silver lining here is that you were working from home with your dad around! I am assuming that its possible they got data from various recruiting sites like linkedIn or shine or the online courses or those websites where the make you register like career360 or something. Maybe they sold the data. That's the problem. If a Pakistani is able to do it or an Indian doing it impersonating like a Pakistani; both are scary. These loopholes oneday may become a national security issue. I might be overreacting though. In my opinion, scammers find the loopholes first, then come undesired antisocial elements. Scammers sure have a lot of time. Maybe we should just turn off phone calls entirely. As it is beyond spam and telemarketing hardly anyone you want to speak to Yes. Even though my parents know that I can never do this. They will still get scared and concerned knowing so many fake cases are also there. I was really glad they called when I was working from home. Any other day and who knows what could have happened. Could be . But less chances . More data is sold through psu banks and judiciary. Not the permanent employees But those contractual ones. If you remember the addhar enabled payment system crisis, it was a leak from judiciary , specifically when you buy land by giving fingerprints, the fingerprints are stolen by the contractual employees and used on aeps machines. Similarly banks which employ such people are either threatened or they do it for the love of money.one of the reasons sbi has most offline scams as well, not to mention online ones too Come on, if all politicians can be scammers whats wrong with a poir contractual employee scamming people?? Oh my god. Increase trust in home. If your local politician turns out to be a scammer, your parents will blame you That guy is Tamil serial actor Wonder if this is from the aadhar data breach or something else Yeah he does look like one of those Crime Patrol kind of actor. It’s happening a lot (son arrested & father getting call). Have you given any competitive exam recently? Someone earlier mentioned that NEET / JEE data got leaked. As a rule I do not pickup calls from unknown numbers and let them go to voicemail. Do this and your life will be much better I did register on similar websites where they ask for these data. That's why I commented somewhere else that they could have gotten my data from there. proxy sim cards The worrying thing is that people still fall for it. And by that I mean a lot of people. Most likely since they know the approx age and they always call the father's number. For me, they sent my WhatsApp photo poorly edited on paint next to some porn images with the words \"wanted rapist\" written across and sent it to me. With the threat that they would send it to my entire contact list unless I send them money. I wonder how do they obtain the numbers to do the scam. Also am I weird for having that image saved, 6 months later.... >next dance of democracy Nanga nach I just copied the times of india headline when elections take place. I am sorry , i do not agree with you. Nanga nach is not done by politicians Nanga nach is only done by chief justice of India. /s. Got a similar call about a week ago. Called the police inspector that was in the profile photo (different from OP). He said that they are aware and forwarding these numbers to cyber security. He said simply don't pick up calls starting with +92 (Pakistani numbers). Additionally, all these calls come from WhatsApp, my recommendation would be to just disconnect any unknown number that calls on WhatsApp. Man, why dont these scammers call me? I also wanna have some fun ;-; The same thing happened to me the only difference was my father picked the call. I was just standing beside him and laughing when the scammer claimed to be a police officer with a Pakistan number. It happened around 2 weeks ago so I guess this is the new trend. 😂😂😂 The thing is, people go to panic mode when the caller says he is a cop or IT officer or any such government officials... Pata hai scammers kisko paisa dete hai so that they can continue evading the authorities? I know someone who scams for a living. I think tgis scam is is trend nowadays. These guys approach using whatsapp calls. Yesterday my father received similar call and guy said he is from CBI. He even had CBI logo photo as whatspp profile picture. These guys are truly hilarious. What is up with scammers posing as police Using the same name as the criminal used in [past](https://medium.com/@cybercrimeblogs/delhi-police-arrested-sp-ram-pandey-used-to-target-victims-of-sextortion-5c1eacd63056). I wonder if he is out on bail Woh toh theek hai par pakistan ke extension wale calls uthaate kyun hai log? Where did they get relationship details, names and phone numbers for two people? Only place I remember is the cowin data where you specify such a thing. Maybe some other breach though Because you can see the child data linked to the head of family in adhaar. waiting for such calls Maybe maybe not. Aafhar is not the only source these scammers have for getting ur details Have received multiple calls over the last few months. One was from the “telecom department”, claiming that there is another number in my name and that number was used to abuse ladies. Recent one was similar to OPs case. The call came on my father’s WhatsApp number, caller was speaking in hindi. Fortunately, i was there right beside father when this happened. He gave me the phone because he doesn’t understand hindi. The caller said he is from CBI and asked where is your son. He did mess up the names like OP mentioned. He was calling my father by my name and asking where’s your son. I asked him couple of times what’s the matter and he kept repeating he is from CBI and wants to know where my son is. Blocked him off immediately, but this is becoming a real pain, and I’m sure a lot of people will panic when the caller claims to be from police, CBI etc Scammers deserve the North Korea treatment in India tbh🗿 Benefits of wfh. Someone tell management. Did you not notice the +92? How are they getting these details from? OP lol, he’s an actual senior IPS officer from Odisha cadre named Yogesh Khurania, please contact his official email and mention that he is being impersonate, they take these things very seriously. Official emails are available to the public. My father would whoop my ahh first and then ask what’s the matter lol. For real if they call 2nd or 3rd time, then i pick up cuz then there are better chances that its genuine call Real silver lining is you don't have a son Definitely an asshat, but this works in favour of scammers. People who are less likely to fall for the scams notice such things (Foreign number, incorrect web addresses, wrong details, spelling and grammatical mistakes, etc.) and call out the scammers. Scammers then hang up and move on to the next target, thus weeding out people less likely to fall for scams. Yeah there must be others. What ones do you know? scammers do text me but they never called me.... I had so much fun texting them lol... +92 is a Pakistani based number, I think? Maybe that's why they didn't realise change in names 🤣 Look we found an asshattier asshat then these scammers My college friend passed away in a hit and run accident last year. I recently got to know from a common friend (was also a relative of the deceased) that his father received a similar call a couple of months ago. I can only imagine what his father felt like. These people are scum of the earth. +92 is from pakistan Any form u fill anywhere, be it banks, entering a giveaway, feedback etc are all collected by call centers. Whenever u go for a xerox, few shops take a dummy copy of ur personal docs and sell them to these call centers. There is a tamil movie called irumbu thirai. Watch it. It does a great job in explaining how these scams happen. It's also a very entertaining movie Settings> Privacy> Calls> Silence unknown callers. Switch this setting to 'ON', with this your life would have more time to spend with family. I am getting similar calls from customs, fedex, UPS etc where they say your parcel is stuck and have cocaine in it, I need to go on video call with officer asap else i'll be arrested. It's so sad, what is happening? These guys have ZERO fear of law? Bhaiya humari bhi naukri lagwa do. I do the same(though I don't have voicemail set up) , and my friends and family thinks it's weird. They are like \"just pick up, what if it's important\" even for unknown WhatsApp calls. And they give out other info and then money because else they threaten to call your family members / defame Who still answers their phone? Everyone knows an Indian dude on the phone = scam. Greetings from Germany, where we have to drink from paper straws so you guys can keep unloading the trash straight to the ocean. I’ll have a steak tonight Seems like common sense is not that common in German. The phone number is clearly from Pakistan. That's why I remain Unemployed It was sarcasm bro. Either way doing hindu muslim football game wont give jobs to either hindu or muslim Play religious football, be fucked economically forever. I think it's pretty easy to get Pakistani burner numbers to register so scammers from all nationalities prefer them. Like back in the day when all music and video piracy sites used to be registered on .pk domains because of laxer rules there. In this case, the scammers are most probably Indian. Scammers from abroad usually demand payment in foreign gift cards or crypto (more difficult now). bhai jo sbse niche kaam karta hai usi ko pehle pakadta hai, the higher ups are untouchable. Pehle 2lakh bail money read karle fir join karle. On X when white supremacists bash India and Indians, and call us scammers and shiet, Pakistanis join them as well and call us scammers. Here a Pakistani is trying to scam an Indian lol. Lol recieved this today... It's getting weekly activity now lol at least u get to have fun with them on a weekly basis.... Le me guess he is from Ambala Sadar, and told you that your son has been involved in some kind of ra#e activity lol I bullied this guy a lot One of my roommates dad also got the same call. We’re in US, his parents are in Hyderabad, and the said they arrested him in Haryana. Luckily they got their money back. Same shit happened to my friend His mother called in the morning crying that his brother has raped someone and they are asking 50k, his mother even asked to talk to his son and there was somebody crying But luckily we have known about this because it already had happened to our juniors So he calmed her down and called his brother and he was sleeping in his hostel room It was a tense situation man Lol, 'Call me' had me laughing my ass of...🤣🤣 Ladies & Gentlemen, i present to you security that are 13 feet high and five feet thick. I just pretend to be conworkers to all scammers. So if someone calls saying he is from cbi - I am like which branch, coz I work there too and so forth. Its hilarious and makes them panic Turn off unknown callers, both android and iOS have it TBH I would be worried police will hassle the person reporting instead of investigating the issue itself I’ve reported a similar one before, they acknowledged the report and asked me to respond to any future communication from the department. I had attached the call recording as well as the WhatsApp messages and screencap from truecaller. Been almost a year, pulis haven’t bothered me yet. Haan bhaiya paise taiyaar hai, batao knha dene hai. I have a special whatsapp sticker just for these guys before I report them..hehee this is scary, mere papa ke paas ye aa jaata toh pata nahi kya hota mera"
