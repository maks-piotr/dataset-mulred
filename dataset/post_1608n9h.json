    "selftext": "Hello everyone this is Kaju, a 2 month old stray kitten that i recentky took in. Kaju's 2 siblings passed away by a bike accident and dog attack very recently. I have been feeding them for some time and it broke my heart and I could no more let Kaju fight for it's life on the streets. I took Kaju in yesterday and kept it in this cage as Kaju is unfortunately running away and a bit unfriendly. I want to adopt Kaju and take care of this baby.\n\nNow I am a college student and from my previous posts you can see I inquired about free vaccination for cats. Unfortunately Kaju is too small and restless to travel to be taken to a government hospital which is why I have to take Kaju to a private vet here which is considerably expensive for me. As I am still not earning I would like to ask for help for Kaju's veterinary expenses(vet visit, vaccination, deworming) through your donations. I will be providing my UPI where you can donate any small amount. Even if you cannot donate please wish well for Kaju\n\nUPI: rinas80173789@barodampay\n\nMerchant name: Rina Saha\n\nWhile donating for Kaju please mention in note \"For Kaju\". I will be grateful if you could donate even a small amount. It would help me out with Kaju's veterinary expenses a lot. Thank you in advance ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

        "Wishing a good life for Kaju! If you're on a tight budget, you can still provide a balanced diet for your cat. Look for affordable yet decent-quality cat food that lists meat as a primary ingredient. You might also consider making homemade cat food using recipes that include lean meats like chicken or turkey. Just make sure to avoid feeding them human foods that can be harmful. Your cat's health is important, so consult with your veterinarian for guidance on providing the best possible diet within your budget constraints. Additionally, reaching out to your friends for help can also be a great idea.",

        "I know it's quite challenging to raise a cat in an environment dominated by dogs, which might explain the scarcity of cats in India. People attempting to care for them often overlook the fact that cats are carnivorous animals, unable to process dairy products and human food. As a result, many cats suffer from either malnutrition or dog attacks, leading to their unfortunate demise. I appreciate your efforts, and I wish I could contribute, but I'm not currently using UPI.",
