An ambulance was called and that senior got suspended ( when I say senior I was in 4th grade and they were in 5th ) I'm convinced that 95% of people who use the phrase \"intrusive thoughts\" don't actually know what it means and are using it only because they've seen it in some meme Considering how physically abusive my teachers were, that's a pleasant change. How do they know it was exactly 108 times? Was someone standing with a counter. Or is this because NDTV likes to see Hindutva in everything :D . Will wait for the bhakts to chime in and show solidarity with the compass and our rishi who invented it 1500 years before Europeans. I think this is because if those crime drama Web series.lol >Class 4 Boys Attack Classmate With Compass 108 Times After Fight At School Man,wtf !! We need a psychologist at every school to monitor the kids it seems Stab wounds after medical examination i guess Lmao Are you really this dumb ? Ban pens and pencils too then. Please ban rulers(scale) too, I got PTSD because of how my teacher used to hit my knuckles with it. I don't want my future kids to face the same.

From my perspective, kids nowadays are morally bankrupt and are very violence prone. I am not surprised to read this and the frequency of violent incidents will increase. Auspicious Hindu pooja number duh. It depends on the school The no beating is in top private schools But who kept count? 108 times is oddly specific! And how is that supposed to be a bad thing. Indian laws should be stricter against teachers, mfs think they are some emperor hitting a vulnerable kid. I don't blame them, I would be pretty mad too if I made 25-30K a month at 40 How does it feel to bully a kid who can't defend himself? I didn't say it a bad thing, back when we were kids it was different, punishment included beating standing outside, sanding on bench, beating, back then I guess every school had a teacher who used to be famous for beating and there was a teacher famous for being the nicest It was 8th as far as i remember Had one of those go through my skin once because some kid had his rounder sticking out of his bag. Not a great memory. Scolding to theek hai lekin teacher ka maarna is unacceptable except in the case of extreme situations. Postmortem me pata chala hoga most probably. Are bhai like what are you on about. Like no 4th class cares about politics or religion. It is most probably just a coincidence. He got that dawg in him Not that it would fix anything. You can't ban pens and pencils after that. Not to mention no one gives two fucks about safety in the chemistry and physics labs. If you are smart you'll stay out fucked up fights like this. Which is the case most of the time."
