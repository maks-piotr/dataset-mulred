I never finished it but it touched my heart. I am gonna go read Hearts Of Darkness sometime soon. **8.5/10**\n\n**Assassins Creed 2** - Also beautiful . Much more tolerable with missions compared to AC1 which was horrible. I never finished 1 but I am near completion of AC2. There is so much to explore and Venice is beautiful. Just rowboating is fun enough **9/10**\n\n**S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow Of Chernobyl**- Its like Half Life 2 , FarCry2 and survival horror mixed into one. I cant describe it. It almost made me fall down from my chair 10 times I can count of. Scary, hauntingly beautiful and very very atmospheric. Love it.  Still playing it . **10/10**\n\n**GTA4** - Overrated imo. The story is grimdark and well written . The physics and graphics are awesome but this wasnt the GTA I grew up with. I had played Liberty City Stories  just one month before so I can confirm . It was really tightly knit. I always had something to do and keep engaged but GTA4 is a slogfest. The same missions and always doing side missions to maintain friendships with people. I get what they were going for but its not my thing. I will finish it and then mess around because thats what GTA is for . Mods and cheats. I dont use cheats for the first playthrough though. **8/10 for the story and graphics and physics, 0/10 for pacing**",
