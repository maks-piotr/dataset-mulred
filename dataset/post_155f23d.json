        "> On learning about Herodas‚Äô arrest, the women folk of Petchi village converged and headed to the house of the accused after a brief discussion amongst themselves. The group of women started vandalising the house of the accused and set it on fire.\n\n> ‚ÄúBe it Meitei or other communities, as a woman, outraging a woman‚Äôs dignity is not acceptable. We cannot allow such a person to be in our society. It‚Äôs a shame to the entire Meitei community,‚Äù said a Meira Paibi leader. Meira Paibis or ‚Äúwomen torch bearers‚Äù are a senior women-led activist group with no rigid hierarchy, structure, or overt political leanings.",

        "I have friends and known people  from Manipur, Meiteis and Nagas. While I heard one side of the story from the Meiteis, my known Naga people who were in Imphal and few neibouring areas during this time told about how the Meiteis were the instigators and how they had open help from the local police force to purpetrate all kind of violence on Kuki houses and people. They said they were scared of the Meira Paibis esp as those women were ruthless and even the Army and Paramilitary forces could not do anything esp as AFSPA is withdrawn in the valley areas. Most Naga people just sat quietly at home hoping that the Meiteis would not target them next. Incidentally, the Meiteis did end up killing a Naga woman whose head is still not found till today.\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/disturbing-naga-womans-killing-puts-tense-manipur-on-the-edge-8847286/\n\nThis is why with all due respect to my Meiteis friends, I tend to take their version with a pinch of salt. Yes, there was violence done by both sides, but from what I heard, it was the Meiteis who started it while the Kukis retaliated here and there. This seems to support why it was the Kukis who were asking for help and President's rule from the very begining of this conflict.",
        "I'm surprised you are speaking so delicately. I was under the impression all this time that this was a Meiti led aggression. They are the dominant group in terms of land, power and influence. I thought this entire situation started because they were making excessive demands.",
        "That's why we need police to do their job. It's anarchy that leads to mob violence and vigilantism, both of which push us more into anarchy.",
        "What were these women doing for the past two months ? \n\nI support neither side but no matter who started the war it doesn‚Äôt justify rape / molestation of a woman",
        "I tend to speak delicately as I try to avoid conflicts. üôÇ\n\nThe Meiteis are totally dominant in power and influence. They lack land which is what they have been trying to acquire. The so-called 90% tribal land that the Meiteis keep talking about has only about 40% inhabitable space, with poor infrastructure and lack of health options. Mostly all state development has been concentrated in Imphal area, a simple drive out of Imphal into any of  the hill areas will show the stark difference in road infrastructure and other facilities. Coming back to the 90% tribal land point. A large part of that tribal land has been declared as Forest land by the Govt which means no one can settle or develop there.",
        "This is just making one person a scapegoat when they were dozens of people in the video. Are you gonna tell me the whole village were unaware of what happened for the last two months until the video surfaced online? They didn't care, now they just want to save face.",
        "Maybe, they are a different group of women, but are they different in their views? I would be willing to accept that when they show their willingness to burn down the homes of everyone who participated and not the single scapegoat they put worth after it went viral on social media.",
