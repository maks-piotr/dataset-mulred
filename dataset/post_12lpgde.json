        "The same thing has already happened in Florida.",
        "Teacher (thousands years ago): Let me tell you stories that will help you remember concepts of science in a simple fashion. Since we don’t have good means to store and propagate information, oral storytelling is best way. \n\nRW (now): that’s history. Darwin can suck it. \n\n🤪",
        "Hindu groups pushed the theory of Dashavatar?",
        "darn it, can't argue with that !! fir sahi hi hoga /s",
        "Dude, about creationism bullshit.",
        "Actually this should be seen in the context of the Government giving itself the power to \"fact-check\" social media posts. Once that law is passed, you cannot even educate students on YouTube or other SM about the Mughal era, because that would constitute \"fake news\" as per the government.",
        "And this theory wasn't prevalent before that? Why blame them or anyone else? Are we legally bound to go by the way they think?",
        "Stop pointing at others for bullshit happening here, no one from these extremist group know or care about what west thinks, it's just a common denominator among religious morons",
        "I just found it too convenient that extremists are targeting the same things (Theory of Evolution, and LGBTQIA+) at the same time?",
        "It was swept under the rug. Hindus are expert at dropping outdated theories (most of the time, with a heavy asterisk) and taking up new ones in favour of science. Like the heliocentric model, solar system, evolution, etc.\n\nEvolution has been taught for years in India, and has been well accepted. All of a sudden, these extremists are now targeting the theory of Evolution in particular, seems a bit sus to me.",
        "As much as we think religion are different it's same, it's about some old book written by a bigot in the times where women didn't have freedom and science wasn't very prevalent. Conservatives everywhere will try to defend this old shit no matter what",
        "Science ki book bhi toh hogi na ki nhi",
        "Taking up new ones in favour of science?! That's a laugh. \n\nThis shit has been there for a long time, I believe Dayanand Saraswati was against Darwinism. I also remember one guy talking shit about evolution in Ram ke Naam docu. Now that the extremists are in power, they are forcefully thrusting their views without any proper arguments.",
        "That's the point. It's a decentralized religion so it's always hard to debunk. Everyone has a different interpretation of the same old shit. With 800 million followers, they have 800 million different versions of the same religion.",
        "Huh? Instead of standing up against this shit, why would you want to blame others? You know this dasavatar theory has always been there and yet you want to blame US? This shit is being pushed because of the religio-fascist govt which is in power now. Religious ppl need to connect everything with their religion otherwise they simply can't think properly. \n\nWhat dyu mean by decentralized religion? As opposed to ones like Islam (mecca) and Catholics (vatican)? It feels like you think Christianity and Islam do not have versions.\n\nEdit: Sorry if this comes off as rude",
        ">why would you want to blame others?\n\nI'm just trying to show a correlation. That doesn't mean I'm implying any type of causation.\n\n>You know this dasavatar theory has always been there and yet you want to blame US?\n\nThat's the point. It has always been a thing, but why are they flaring this issue now? They are taking inspiration from confederate states in US (that's what I think, but it's not a hill I'm willing to die on). They successfully managed to kick Evolution out of curriculum, ban any books that remotely explored anything they deemed 'anti-christian' like LGBTQIA+, ban abortion and what not. These have been recent events, so I'm just trying to connect dots. I think it's worth exploring.\n\n>What dyu mean by decentralized religion?\n\nThere is no central authority in Hinduism. A majority of it's followers only follow the religion and not any institution (Though it's increasing in recent years). Christianity and Islam are heavily hierarchical religion. The more decentralized sects of Abrahamic faiths are less in number and following.",
        "This shit has been going on for years. Conservatives everywhere like to do this, it's just that now they're in power. The rise of the right in many countries means more such stupid moves, and they'd do it regardless of whether another country has done it before them. I get what ur trying to say, but these views against evolution have been persistent in India too for a long time. Many who do believe in evolution justify it with religious explanation. \n\nWhat's an institution? Aren't priests considered to be an institution? A majority only follow the religion.... Meaning they read books and perform whatever rituals on their own? \n\nWe really need to step up in standing against religion, asking tough questions to ourselves. There is a huge undercurrent of religious apologia instead of addressing issues head on.",
        "I'm answering a lot of these questions from personal experience and things I've seen. So take it with a pinch of salt.\n\n>What's an institution? Aren't priests considered to be an institution? A majority only follow the religion.... Meaning they read books and perform whatever rituals on their own?\n\nAn individual priest doesn't hold any sense of influence in the community as (say) a Pastor does in a Christian community.\n\nI feel like indian religions are more of a community based thing that's been passed down generations. People don't bother to read anything about their religion, or even if they do, they read dumb down diet version of folk texts, that don't show the 'dark' sides of their religion. This created a handsome version of their faith in their mind where they consider everything and every concept that they believe in, as a part of their religion. And they can find an explanation to believe that, cause there is NO central authority. Even if a priest comes and say 'LGBT is against Hinduism', libral Hindus will still call bullshit on him. (The same goes the other way)\n\n>We really need to step up in standing against religion, asking tough questions to ourselves. There is a huge undercurrent of religious apologia instead of addressing issues head on.\n\nAtheism and Rationalism are still sensitive topics in India, especially cause faith is a huge deal here. Existence of rivalling religions and even religious sects have created a condition where religion has become an identity of people. By openly condemning all religions and everything that zealots hold dear, atheists will only invite attention. I don't wanna be centre of hatred. Just pick the battles that most affect us and move on.\n\nAgain I see your point on why people would like to be aggressive about religion, but that's just extremism on the other end. I'm a moderate, so I don't agree with any and all extremists, even the anti-theists.",
        "I meant being aggressive about religion with oneself, not against society. Meaning not settling for weak explanations and deflections, instead hold it to hard scrutiny before believing in it. \n\nAs for the institutions thing, it's the same with priests everywhere. Godmen have enormous influence and so do local priests. I can tell you that many read the Bible, but a lot more don't. They dumb down the stories too. And there are those who are liberal. \n\nAlso, imo moderates are privileged in the sense that they haven't really been affected, by religion for example. They are quite okay for slow slow reform, while avoidable incidents happen all the time. I say that because I quite liked the idea of being moderate before actually facing some serious shit."
