    "selftext": "I have many beloved memories of visiting my Auntie and her family in Chennai. Running along the banks of the mighty river, catching fireflies in the gardens at night, the bustling markets, the incredible food, my families eclectic home. Yet my memories are so tainted by incidents where I feared for my life, where I felt eaten alive by the eyes of men around me. Where I was told, as a 8 year old, to not look men directly in the eyes. Where I was groped and shoved and grabbed and leered at. Today, as I realized my cousin has gotten on her flight, the last person in my family to move back to Europe, I stumbled across an article with the headline \"More than 1 million women disappeared in India between 2019-2021\" ([article](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2023/07/31/more-than-1-million-women-went-missing-in-india-from-2019-to-2021/) )  \n\n\nThroughout the years, I never asked my cousins about what I worried about the most, if they are safe.  I would push the thought out of my mind as soon as it came and I would not read news regarding the massive violence against women in India. The understanding of this immense danger was so clear, so imminent, I felt suffocated by the idea that my cousins could fall prey to violence and femicide.  \n\n\nNow that my last family member has left, it feels as though a gigantic weight has lifted from me. I will never have to fear for her again. But still I pray for the millions of women in India, who fear for their lives everyday. ",

It‚Äôs alright to compare the standard of living and factors such as women safety. India is clearly lacking in those vectors.

My head hangs in shame when I see incidents like Japanese tourist assaulted during Holi or child kidnapped and raped. \nOne thing I thank God for is that I have bad enough eyesight that I didn't get into this activity. I remember fighting a friend when he asked me to come checkout a girl with big breasts, she heard us and I can only imagine what must be going on in her. What's her mistake, being objectfied for what? Just existing.\nSo I can definitely not feel the pain and anger but I do understand. \n\nI am preparing to join the civil services.\nEven my own brother says we should leave India and settle in North America. I only try to explain that I trying to fight the issues of India, so how can I leave. Wherever I go I will only be a migrant, this is my home. Many many issues plague this country but it is also my responsibility to improve the situation so that it's better for the next generations of Indians. \n\nI hope this explains my point of view.\n\nI am sorry If I offended you.

Nope it has a lot of issues . Is India a rapist hellhole like you have described , also nope . You have linked 1 million women have dissaperead in 3 years , our hearts bleed that so many of our sisters have dissaperead. So that's 333 thousand out of 600 million per year . You can do the maths yourself and compare it with world averages , we are not in the front or the back . I'm not making any excuses it's very bad to be even in the middle .\n\nhttps://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/rape-statistics-by-country\n\nI just pulled the first result from Google , there are many such statistics that always consistently show India is nowhere near the hellhole you all portray it to be .\n\nIf you are referring to the Manipur incident yes we are deeply ashamed , however in your rants you make it seem like it is a daily occurance . It is not . It is happening in a region which is almost in a state of war and the very structure of society is in a complete state of chaos .the animals caught doing this will be caught and never see the light of the day , but the point I'm trying to make is these are circumstances that are not as common as you are making it out to be .",

        ">Have the women in your life experiences of assault, rape and violence? How many of them?\n\nSince you asked , none . My mom's side has 6 women . My dad's side has 15. I'd say at Max one woman has encountered domestic violence due to a shit marriage but all the women were supportive towards her and reprimanded the male . They eventually divorced and I know that now she is living happily .\n\nDo they feel safe ? Sure during the day yes , during the night not so much but even i as a male don't feel safe during the night , due to cops catching people at random and then fleecing money if you don't have id or a good reason for being out at late night .\n\n>Most families I know have had bad incidences happen to female family members.\n\nI mean this very subjective . It depends on so many things the area , the class ( rich , middle , poor ) . I lived in Chennai in an area called saligram and it was a low middle class area and there were barely any women indecency issues or even domestic violence . I don't doubt your observations but you are taking your very small sample sizes and extrapolating it to 600 million plus women .\n\n>All of this is bad here too, but significantly less so and also less normalized in language, public life, media, etc\n\nNo one is disputing that , compared to Germany it is definitely more . But Germany is far far more advanced and developed from education system to religion to law and order . From the grassroots level the right education is being provided , in India just getting education is itself a challenge , naturally we won't be able to reflect the numbers shown by advanced countries .\n\nAnd I don't think we are normalising anything . We remember each and every incident and though rather sadly I can't say we have learnt 100% lessons from each incident ( if that was the case after nirbhaya nothing would have happened) , we are definitely making slow and sure progress . Maybe not to the level you will be happy with but we are definitely trying our hardest to change .",

Me and friends (M+F) travelled from Chennai to Ooty to Goa, with lots of stops in between. With our male friend we felt mostly safe, then toward Goa in a hotel in a small town, our female friend got assaulted.

        "Generally, Indian men love rape and this goes for all of the Indian subcontinent. Rape has been a huge part of Indian culture. From Ramayan to movies made in modern times. The way people curse in India is quite revealing about the way men treat women as it's almost always about having sex with a female relative, whether it be sister or mother. The culture needs to change in the whole subcontinent and change comes after admitting that the root cause is the culture. Hindus always argue that they worship Goddesses and what not but they are not much better than many Islamic countries. India is completely and utterly Islamized in that sense.",

Probably even beaten up by male relatives. My only sexual harassment experiences have been in India and it‚Äôs the place I least visit. Life is much better outside India for women and I have lived in countries way way way more poor than India.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "My cousin, the last of my family has moved out of India. A sigh of relief escaped me and I want to share why.",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I have many beloved memories of visiting my Auntie and her family in Chennai. Running along the banks of the mighty river, catching fireflies in the gardens at night, the bustling markets, the incredible food, my families eclectic home. Yet my memories are so tainted by incidents where I feared for my life, where I felt eaten alive by the eyes of men around me. Where I was told, as a 8 year old, to not look men directly in the eyes. Where I was groped and shoved and grabbed and leered at. Today, as I realized my cousin has gotten on her flight, the last person in my family to move back to Europe, I stumbled across an article with the headline \"More than 1 million women disappeared in India between 2019-2021\" ([article](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2023/07/31/more-than-1-million-women-went-missing-in-india-from-2019-to-2021/) ) Throughout the years, I never asked my cousins about what I worried about the most, if they are safe. I would push the thought out of my mind as soon as it came and I would not read news regarding the massive violence against women in India. The understanding of this immense danger was so clear, so imminent, I felt suffocated by the idea that my cousins could fall prey to violence and femicide. Now that my last family member has left, it feels as though a gigantic weight has lifted from me. I will never have to fear for her again. But still I pray for the millions of women in India, who fear for their lives everyday.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "My family is still in India and I‚Äôm trying everythjng to get them out of there. Visiting after so many years and I genuinely cannot stand walking those streets anymore. The country is broken. We just save our families. Imagine being a Pakistani and getting shocked by Indian roads. A few days back you were complaining for not getting Visa to visit from UK and now once you're here you cannot stand walking the streets. Truly no winning with you lot That article was a miss lead most of the girls return home within a week. I will share when I will get the supporting article. ‚ÄúMost of the girls return home within a week‚Äù .. after what though? After kidnapping? Rape? Torture? This doesn‚Äôt really make it better at all! now many people will bash you for this post, but the truth is, anyone will lead a better standard of life in Europe and the US than India. Best of luck. Isn't this too much? You wanted to leave, then leave. Hope you reach the paradise your dreams, where no sin exists. Khade ho kar bolna bahot easy hai. Ghar ke safai me haath gande kaun kare. Nahi? Shameful. Anyways hope wherever you reach, you can truly call that place your home and natives accept you as the same. Isn't this too much? You wanted to leave, then leave. Hope you reach the paradise your dreams, where no sin exists. Khade ho kar bolna bahot easy hai. Ghar ke safai me haath gande kaun kare. Nahi? Shameful. Anyways hope wherever you reach, you can truly call that place your home and natives accept you as their own. Sorry if it was not clear from my writing. My Aunt moved to India for her business and took her family with her, my cousins were 2 and 3 years old at the time. They were there as foreigner/expats from France. Venting here, because I‚Äôve never understood how violence against women could be so normalized.. this post is giving 'I'm living a better life than y'all' vibes üò≠ Thank you. It was a cultural thing that I never understood and maybe now I can talk to my cousins about how they dealt with it. Go to the Muslim and Balkan populated areas in Strasbourg Yea this wasn‚Äôt intended at all but I totally see it too. I‚Äôm so sorry. I had some of my best childhood memories in India and I have great love for especially Tamil Nadu. If it wasn‚Äôt for the severe violence women face I would consider to travel to India again and even to live there. It was a combination of being super shocked by this article and happy for my family to move back home.. Please fuck off without these idiotic rants Ya no worries I live in Berlin where groping and harassing is part of my daily reality too. It‚Äôs bad everywhere on this planet, in India and the Middle East the violence and oppression of women is, devastatingly so, on a whole other level.. Nautanki and drama . Now you have come to gloat that you live in Berlin. Get out of here . in this post you're saying you're very glad that you/your family won't be harassed in the streets anymore WHILE reminding us indians that we might be. very very tone deaf and unnecessary IMO. That wasn‚Äôt the point though. Gotta admit that india has a big problem no?? You think women are ok here?? I would suggest getting out of your cosy European city and travelling a bit around the real world so that your perception isn‚Äôt so warped. You want to extrapolate a statistic and apply it to the whole country, across all economic classes? 1 million is 0.006% of the population. 1.5 billion people live here and good chunk of that is a thriving population. It‚Äôs alright to compare the standard of living and factors such as women safety. India is clearly lacking in those vectors. But to make it sound like this place is fucking Mordor where every minute women are disappearing left right and centre is just ridiculous. I guess the sensational news headline has done its job. I recommend subscribing to better quality journalism which respects nuance and isn‚Äôt a doomseller. Well, if Indians are the biggest problem, we are migrating all around the world. You aren‚Äôt safe then, I guess? What exactly are you venting about? I don't see a point here. I am really seeing the severe tone deafness of this post. I am not white but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm absolved of the insensitivity that comes with mostly growing up in the privileged confines of ‚Äúsafe‚Äù Europe. I am super sorry. Do you think I should delete this whole post or the whole text and leave up the article..? I obv carry a lot of anger in me when it come to violence against women and other ppl made vulnerable by shit minds. But in the case of India I guess I thought it was something I was also affected by since I spent big chunks of my summer childhoods with my family, realizing now that maybe it‚Äôs not at all for me to chime in when was the last time you visited India? You know this is an extremely over exaggeration right? 2018 I guess you have got some wrong idea. I wouldn't say that India is a completely safe place for women but this post somehow sounds misleading. Idk if you really meant it, anyhow this seems a bit unnecessary, the whole 'venting'. Stupid ass comment, sin exists everywhere but India has a major problem with rape culture and it‚Äôs treatment of women. OP and her family left India for a new place for increased safety, no shame in that. You can‚Äôt expect a demographic privy to crime to be the ones that change the country Ignore them, india has a problem w rape culture as i mentioned in one of my other comments. Wanting to leave india in search of a safer place isn‚Äôt something to be shamed for. You‚Äôre good dw about it üëç Ma'am violence against women can never be accepted as normal. Women's rights in India have come a long way, still many issues exist including thr constant ogling you mention. No one can deny the lived reality of women all over the world including India. This starring issue is within every class of society-from the bottom to the top and I am a witness to this. My head hangs in shame when I see incidents like Japanese tourist assaulted during Holi or child kidnapped and raped. One thing I thank God for is that I have bad enough eyesight that I didn't get into this activity. I remember fighting a friend when he asked me to come checkout a girl with big breasts, she heard us and I can only imagine what must be going on in her. What's her mistake, being objectfied for what? Just existing. So I can definitely not feel the pain and anger but I do understand. I am preparing to join the civil services. Even my own brother says we should leave India and settle in North America. I only try to explain that I trying to fight the issues of India, so how can I leave. Wherever I go I will only be a migrant, this is my home. Many many issues plague this country but it is also my responsibility to improve the situation so that it's better for the next generations of Indians. I hope this explains my point of view. I am sorry If I offended you. I hope that a day comes when you and other women could feel happy and safe here, at home. Bunch of insecure dumbasses in this post, OP‚Äôs sharing her reasons for leaving India, like it or not, it‚Äôs not safe for women compared to western countries. If you think OP is somehow rubbing it in your face then you might be brain dead. Anytime anybody even slightly privileged comes and posts, all you dumbasses get riled up and start shitting on them even if they have valid issues I totally understand you, thank you for sharing your perspective. Respect to you, for standing up for women and putting in efforts to making this world a place where we can all feel safe! If only we were all as aware of our responsibilities and moral obligations to eachother üíú Listen all I can say is sorry you to experience that in your childhood , you have deep underlying trauma and i hope you get the help you need to move on with your life . Now coming to your vent , you equated something that happened to you in your childhood and applied it to everyone , that doesn't work everywhere I am afraid. Is India a perfect place ? Nope it has a lot of issues . Is India a rapist hellhole like you have described , also nope . You have linked 1 million women have dissaperead in 3 years , our hearts bleed that so many of our sisters have dissaperead. So that's 333 thousand out of 600 million per year . You can do the maths yourself and compare it with world averages , we are not in the front or the back . I'm not making any excuses it's very bad to be even in the middle . I just pulled the first result from Google , there are many such statistics that always consistently show India is nowhere near the hellhole you all portray it to be . If you are referring to the Manipur incident yes we are deeply ashamed , however in your rants you make it seem like it is a daily occurance . It is not . It is happening in a region which is almost in a state of war and the very structure of society is in a complete state of chaos .the animals caught doing this will be caught and never see the light of the day , but the point I'm trying to make is these are circumstances that are not as common as you are making it out to be . It‚Äôs not Indians. It‚Äôs rape culture, this is especially bad in India. But it is also bad everywhere in the world. it's not. india isn't safe. we know that already. that's why reminding us of that while feeling happy for having to not deal with it is so fucking annoying. Boo hoo you‚Äôll come across posts or ppl like this irl too, can‚Äôt be annoyed all the time bout it. Op isn‚Äôt even trying to be annoying so idk why she‚Äôs getting so much hate Thank you so much for your effort to clarify some numbers with me, it‚Äôs truly appreciated. I have been to a lot of places in the world though, I lived in 6 countries, and I can safely say that I felt the least safe in Saudi Arabia and in India.. in India more so as I got to travel freely and really experience it and know quite a few people there. Most families I know have had bad incidences happen to female family members.. Have the women in your life experiences of assault, rape and violence? How many of them? All of this is bad here too, but significantly less so and also less normalized in language, public life, media, etc boo hoo I can be annoyed at whatever I want üò≠ Fair enough lmaooo Imagine an American leaving America cause there's gun violence thereü§°ü§° have a problem? Change it from within. Anyone can catch flights. Just saying, a little bit of your privilege is showing. Ffff honestly I hate these kinds of ppl flaunting privilege and being patronizing and I‚Äôm feeling shame that I actually have the capacity to be that person.. but I also like some of the discussion happening on here and will probably waste some time feeling conflicted on Reddit ü•¥üíÄ >Have the women in your life experiences of assault, rape and violence? How many of them? Since you asked , none . My mom's side has 6 women . My dad's side has 15. I'd say at Max one woman has encountered domestic violence due to a shit marriage but all the women were supportive towards her and reprimanded the male . They eventually divorced and I know that now she is living happily . Do they feel safe ? Sure during the day yes , during the night not so much but even i as a male don't feel safe during the night , due to cops catching people at random and then fleecing money if you don't have id or a good reason for being out at late night . >Most families I know have had bad incidences happen to female family members. I mean this very subjective . It depends on so many things the area , the class ( rich , middle , poor ) . I lived in Chennai in an area called saligram and it was a low middle class area and there were barely any women indecency issues or even domestic violence . I don't doubt your observations but you are taking your very small sample sizes and extrapolating it to 600 million plus women . >All of this is bad here too, but significantly less so and also less normalized in language, public life, media, etc No one is disputing that , compared to Germany it is definitely more . But Germany is far far more advanced and developed from education system to religion to law and order . From the grassroots level the right education is being provided , in India just getting education is itself a challenge , naturally we won't be able to reflect the numbers shown by advanced countries . And I don't think we are normalising anything . We remember each and every incident and though rather sadly I can't say we have learnt 100% lessons from each incident ( if that was the case after nirbhaya nothing would have happened) , we are definitely making slow and sure progress . Maybe not to the level you will be happy with but we are definitely trying our hardest to change . - Says she‚Äôs relieved that her entire family is out of India, because it‚Äôs unsafe for women. - lives in Berlin MFW It is not just Indians but also law and order, enforcement of said law, corruption of said enforcers, sluggishness of judiciary, political support for abusers and harassers etc Most of these are solved if you move to a developed country She‚Äôll never let the facts come in the way of her narrative. Typical male response, easy to downplay the struggle faced be every single woman in the country just to exist, because you will never have to face something like that yourself again, thanks a lot for your perspective and allowing me to understand my biased, subjective and small sample size experience. People are calling out on the tone deafness of the article, quite rightly. This post reeks. It‚Äôs not. Saying this as a guy I wouldn‚Äôt say i can dismiss your feelings about the country - who am I to do that. But I also doesn‚Äôt understand the point of the post. Doesn‚Äôt your newly adopted country have a subreddit for you to rant in? I think checking out of india subreddit could lift some weight off your shoulders too Why? There is no tone deafness, if anything the opposite. She‚Äôs literally been effected by India‚Äôs rape problem and is sharing that experience to communicate why she decided to leave. Realizing the gross exaggeration and subjective perspective I have due to a really biased view and too little knowledge on lived reality in India. All I can speak for are my experiences and feelings I get when I read the \"news\" (in parenthesis as media on such issues is never really neutral and really sensationalized, like the article I posted) . The last time I was in India was in 2018. Me and friends (M+F) travelled from Chennai to Ooty to Goa, with lots of stops in between. With our male friend we felt mostly safe, then toward Goa in a hotel in a small town, our female friend got assaulted. We then put on wedding rings, a tip from my cousins, and didnt get too much hassle afterwards (just the odd groping and touching here and there and discomfort by staring though, which we were mentally prepared for) The point isn't that this isn't a safe place, it's that this isn't the only unsafe place in the world. Oh ok, so the 'point' was basically \"we are better than pakistan\" Congratulations üéâ I am not saying Pakistan. I am sure rape occurs in many countries around the world and there are places in these countries where it's unsafe for women. India isn't the only such country. These rants are becoming more and more idiotic Facts?! What facts? Facts don‚Äôt matter in today‚Äôs world. I disagree. There‚Äôs a blatant tone deafness in that post. You can disagree with me. That‚Äôs fine. Hey OP Seems like you‚Äôve got rose tinted glasses and a very Eurocentric belief that everywhere except India is good. You should try looking at statistics of Europe and other countries for safety. Wish you and your family the best. Generally, Indian men love rape and this goes for all of the Indian subcontinent. Rape has been a huge part of Indian culture. From Ramayan to movies made in modern times. The way people curse in India is quite revealing about the way men treat women as it's almost always about having sex with a female relative, whether it be sister or mother. The culture needs to change in the whole subcontinent and change comes after admitting that the root cause is the culture. Hindus always argue that they worship Goddesses and what not but they are not much better than many Islamic countries. India is completely and utterly Islamized in that sense. If women in your family did experience any sexual violence or abuse, they wouldn't tell you since culturally it's very shameful. India has a huge problem and needs to step up. I hear you! I also have one female cousin and she‚Äôs coming to Canada and can‚Äôt be more thrilled! It‚Äôs funny everyone here saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not as bad as some countries‚Äù here (usually a man) - if they ask any female member of their family raised in India, they have all been groped, eve teased, and/or other sexual harassment. Probably even beaten up by male relatives. My only sexual harassment experiences have been in India and it‚Äôs the place I least visit. Life is much better outside India for women and I have lived in countries way way way more poor than India. You're right. Pakistan living rent-free in so many Indian's heads lol. You didn't even mention Pakistan. There is literally no reason to bring it into the convo but the other guy managed to do just that. No i would know, not from them but from my cousins . And yes we do need to step up , grassroots level education is required along with stricter laws and it's implementation. I see hateful comments by mostly men as if they know what it like to be a woman in India. I live in Sweden and most women who have ever travelled to India have the same complaint. This goes for Swedes and NRIs both. India sucks when it comes to safety for women. You guys hating on Reddit should be ashamed for putting energy in trying to disprove something you never could have experienced since you're not women. Also, most of the women you know will never honestly tell you about their experiences since it's still very shameful in India to be a victim of sexual crime. Huh. Once, my mentor from an internship told me how she was catcalled/harassed in the streets of London. And then went on to say something like, ‚Äúif I wanted to be treated this way I‚Äôd be in India anyway‚Äù. Not comparing two countries, but sometimes I actually feel that safety is an illusion we create for ourselves :( It's 0.06% \" but sometimes I actually feel that safety is an illusion we create for ourselves :( \" 100% this. As it is non existent for us, we create safety as pockets in time, passing moments of feeling safe. That illusion is over as soon as a man's reality will crash into ours. And obv they are everywhere. London is sooo bad too, someone just told me they had counted to have gotten harassed 16 times in one day. Even worse in Berlin. We have got to start whipping men and revolting drastically or something. In 2022 11896 rape cases took place in Germany while 31677 rape cases took place in India (this is 2021 data , 2022 is yet to be released by NCRB). Now Germany has a population of 83 million (8.3 cr) while india has a population of 1.42 billion(142 cr). So around 14.28 rape per 100000 of the population in Germany. While the same figure stands at about 2.2 per 100000 for india. While nobody is defending the crime committed against women and that such incidences should not occur in a civilized society, but an unfortunate reality is that even if one incident occurs in some corner of this country it is blown out of proportion by all the media houses creating mass sensationalism. While at the same time 100s of such cases may be happening across Europe and USA [ which has 43.5 rapes PER 100000 people , ONE Of the HIGHEST in the world] , most of the media houses don't even bat an eye to such incidences. Thus the common narrative as a result of these coverages became that all the women in india are assault victims and that india is some lawless desolate land where being a woman automatically means you will be molested. i agree. i did the whole \"i pray for the women in india\" thing and im embarassed. I can‚Äôt help it if that‚Äôs the conclusion you want to draw from my comment. Sorry. Typo. Regarding that article, 1 million is the number of women gone missing, not the number of women gone missing _and_ never found. Don't fall for that click bait headline. I don't think you are aware of the fact that most missing reports are closed within days because most people go missing because of petty reasons. Look, I have no problem with anyone emigrating out of India. We all have our reasons and that‚Äôs okay. Not my place to judge. However, one thing I don‚Äôt understand‚Äî how come a bad experience with a bunch people in any other country is a bad experience with that bunch of people, but when it comes to us brown unwashed masses, it‚Äôs a referendum on the entire country and society? I have no doubt that there may be a bunch of people who made you fear for your safety, life, and dignity. I spit on them, and hope that they die a slow and painful death. I am also sorry that you had to experience that, however, you also mentioned in your post that you had a good time in India too, I am sure there must a bunch of people who were friendly, kind, and helpful to you and yours. However, while condemning the assholes who made you fear for your safety, you lumped the good people who came in your life India together with the assholes. Is that fair to them? Somewhere in the comment section, you said you‚Äôre based in Berlin, I‚Äôve been to Berlin and quite a few German cities, and it‚Äôs no utopia. So, if someone makes you feel uncomfortable over there, is it going to be entire German or just those people? Look, I have no problem with anyone emigrating out of India.

They are t the rapists. They aren't the ones who scam. Who works in kidnapping circles. We arent in power. Heck the people we WANT to be in power aren't there either. What do you want us to do? What will posting on reddit, especially Indian reddit accomplish? This is exactly what it is‚Ä¶honestly nobody gives a damn..op your whole family moved to europe? good for you but no need to announce their departure. I live in the United States. All my female/AFAB friends have experienced some form of sexual violence. The world is a really shitty place. I agree that there is a problem with rape and sexual violence in India and we should do what we can but your post implies that Europe and other countries are free from this. Sexual violence isn't inherently an Indian problem, its a patriarchal problem and the way to go about fixing it is to dismantle patriarchy. Good! Glad people like you left India. God! So much arrogance and tone deafness in one post is not what you see everyday even on Reddit. Eh. I wouldn‚Äôt assume that you would know. I‚Äôve been molested thrice. None of my cousins or family know. Meanwhile when I‚Äôve spoken with female friends or even acquaintances about this issue, turns out an easy 80+% have had similar experiences in India. (Disclaimer: anecdata) Not sure if that‚Äôs how you meant it, but an earlier comment of yours mainly focused on DV in the realm of sexual assault. And while that‚Äôs far more severe than molestation, I‚Äôm sure you recognize that it‚Äôs by no means the only form of sexual violence Indian women experience day to day. I 100% agree that my writing is not in the best tone and presenting a super skewed and subjective perspective. I am super sorry about that and quite embarassed but happy to get told I guess. I really need to work on how I see things and how I reflect on how I form an opinion and express that opinion.. Everywhere in this world are women unsafe, I live in Germany where similarly to you, every AFAB person I know has experienced some form of sexual violence. Comparison to how apparent this is in language, culture and media won't make a difference and we will have to fight until we've dismantled the patriarchy, truly Ok? And what is the relevance of that? OP is from India, this is the subreddit called r/India, so of course people will point out about this country. What is the purpose of saying \"but other countries too!\"? What do you mean what relevance does it have? The post was basically, \"I saw the 1 million women reported missing over 3 years news article. I'm so glad my entire family is now in Europe!\" Except [600,000 people go missing in Europe](https://www.amberalert.eu/our-mission) every year. Assuming only half of those are women (typically it's more), that's 900k over 3 years. On a per capita basis that's higher than India. There's a lot India deserves to be criticized for including the missing women, but these people need to look at how dirty their own backyards are first before they start casting judgment on us and dehumanizing us. You think India is good for men or anyone ? Stop whining and do something about it ."
