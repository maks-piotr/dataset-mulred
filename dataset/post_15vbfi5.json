        "I wish",
        "bank will not mesage you on whatsapp. and even if they did they'll take your name. and if it is not your name. you're free.  just call the customer care of the said bank and tell them this problem. might be good to contact any nearest branch manager, he'll be of help. you can also contact ombudsman on rbi.",

Call the guy , tell him the number belongs to you and EMI belongs to probably old guy  .. \n\nAsk his official email I‚Äôd and tell him with a free shot of CIBIL of the loan page only .. only if needed.",

I use paisabazaar personally because they query all four consumer credit agencies and many banks half update info on non-CIibil agencies.
