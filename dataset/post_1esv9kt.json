He recently did a podcast about 2 weeks back and discussed his abortion controversy. It's so insensitive. I really wish for more people to see this and understand it especially after everything this week.\nIndia cannot have the same level of \"dark comedians\" as jimmy carr not because of leftists but because of the society which will internalise this joke and think that its ok to do such things to people. Even if you don't admit it, as a society we are way behind western societies and unlike them the majority mass who listens to this does not know how to differentiate between a joke and reality. This is so important and I wish his followers to see this too!",

        "Are these recent tweets,   \nor   \nold ones?\n\nI have watched this interview. In it, he mentions that he has made mistakes in the past and has (or still has) a bad habit of doubling down at first when someone corrects him (as he was himself bullied for a long time and it is his learned coping mechanism). He has learned that certain things should not be made fun of, and as a performer, he only wants to perform so that he can serve his parents and not make similar mistakes in the future.",
        "His tweet on abortion is in very bad taste. I did not follow this guy, might have seen one or two videos which keeps coming randomly in reels. He should do better. He looks like an immature and may be his followers as someone said is like teenagers, so they feel it is cool but this is irresponsible if some 20 year olds follow him.",
        "The Kusha roast was fairly recent. Hardly a few months ago.",
        "So?  \nKusha Kapila is an adult, who knowingly participated in the roast show where she knew who was going to attend and what was going to happen, these are supposedly all friends from the \"industry\".  \nIf she had any issues with the jokes made, she could have disallowed the airing of the episode like another guest on the show Ashneer Grover.   \nBut she did not, although I am told she has on occasion regretted some of the jokes, but the episode is still up and she is not without resources to get them down as they did censor a lot of the jokes.",
        "Dude it's not a girl's duty to take down bullshit on the internet. That's like saying, people will continue speaking shit about women. And if women have a problem, they should take time off and bring down every content individually.\n\nAnd for your VERY kind information, taking down the entire episode would lead to financial losses, which is why she didn't do it. But she requests the OP to cut out the indecent bit of \"roast\" that is beeped out in the show.\n\nSo, please stop the mental gymanstics to prove that a man talking shit about a girl is her fault. 😃",
        "That girl, Kusha Kapila, is a much bigger (and older, timewise in the industry) star than both Samay and Ashish combined. She came on the show knowing what she was getting into, and she allowed the episode to go/stay on the air as she had no objections. The part she did have objections to was censored.  \nIt is not a random video that someone made without her consent; she took part in it, was there to see its shoot/edit, and was involved in other points before the YouTube upload.  \nIf at any given point she had an issue, or if today she thinks she would rather not have that video up on YouTube, I am quite sure that Kusha Kapila has the resources to get the whole video taken down, regardless of the financial burden to comic Ashish Solanki.  \n  \nSo stop infantilising Kusha Kapila. I am quite sure she knows what she is doing if she has allowed the video to be up.",
        "Boss, the point of the matter is Samay talking shit about women, trivilializing incidents like R*PE and Kusha's matter is just another matter in his entire line of destructive \"dank\" comedy.\n\nI'm just talking about the part that Kusha felt had to be BEEPED out.  Samay shouldn't have said that in the first place. Does not matter if Kusha can take it down or no.  Kusha was aware it was a roast, not that her personal life would be unfolded and crass things would be spoken about her personal life.",

        "1. My initial reply to this post was to ask if Samay has done it again, as just recently in the podcast he said he has learned his lesson and does not wish to repeat the same. On his Twitter/X account, as far as I know, the last post was on the 9th of March 2024, so he could not have made any posts about the current incident. I could not check replies, as I am not on Twitter/X.  \n  \n2. Again, Kusha agreed to the format of the roast; others before her on the same show have had similar or worse said about them.  \nIf she was okay with the format of the roast, she knew that roasters would come to talk about her divorce. I am not 100% sure, but others did joke about that as well. She could have, at any point, halted the process, but she did not, and as it is on the air, it is not too much to assume that she is okay with it.  \n  \nThe video being still up and no negative remarks from Kusha, who has literally made her career out of social media by making comments and being vocal, makes it a non-issue. She is the main person here; any secondary hurt supposedly taken on her behalf by anyone else is pointless.",

This is the problematic part that Samay said. I'm not talking about the divorce bit. She is also OK with those jokes. The part where she is not ok is beeped out.\n\n\nShe has expressed her views a week ago and answered your question \"why didn't she not halt the process\". \n\nhttps://www.np.reddit.com/r/InstaCelebsGossip/s/dbxxTZO8cb",

Making jokes about women constantly thats demeaning and not funny when clearly women are fighting to be treated equally in India and struggling with violence from strangers and family alike along with the burden of expectations of society. Even if its comedy, it just shows a lack of maturity and critical thinking in the audience. IF that is your only material. Samay is in his mid 20's and either he's not mature enough or is just purely pandering to his audience and doesnt believe in jokes.

Freedom of speech should not be culled just because some dumb people take these kinds of jokes seriously, or parrot them. That is what has been enshrined in the constitution. Just to conclude, I am not saying that \"jokes\" such as this should be encouraged nor am I saying that whatever this \"comedian\" has said is correct. But what I am saying is that a societal attitude becomes the precedent, and when that happens freedom of speech is suppress where it is required the most.",

The problem is obviously bigger than an individual making some jokes. \n\nI also learned abusive words from GTA when I was like 12-13. That doesn't mean I go around calling people that. Indian people's sense of right and wrong is horribly skewed. It's because people are so divided and think they are a part of hierarchy such atrocities are committed.

Shock humor is well, meant to shock. If you don't like it, don't follow him. The point of shock humor is to joke about taboos, about things that are normally taken very seriously by society. \n\nShock humor doesn't normalise anything. It's funny precisely because it's abnormal, outside the normal, something so absurd that you have to laugh at it. That absurdism is being completely missed here. \n\nWhy is the abortion joke funny? Because it's relating something serious (abortion) to something so trivial as deleting a tweet. You might think that's in bad taste, but that's just you getting your panties in a twist.",
        "Point taken, and no doubt these elements of media do influence certain sections of society. However, I feel that these incidents occur, we get rightly angry, we start asking questions of the dispensation and the state of law & order in the country which is 200% correct, and then idk maybe cause we are ultimately so powerless towards ever affecting change in that direction, we start pulling out our own little axes to grind. This case has nothing to do with some chindi dindi rich ass influencer with whom probably not even 0.5% of India's youth interact or relate with any manner. \n\nYes, we should definitely talk about the prevalence of misogyny and social ills - gender roles are enforced, women are actively and subtly treated as property, their agency is numbed to the extent that their personal development is heavily stunted, moulded by a constant state of panic. Between women dropping out of schools, the workforce, and being shoved inside the bus of arranged (forced, or pushed into through manipulation) marriage and being turned into accessories to be used by men, the core issue remains that despite the constitution stating so, despite laws being obligated to do so, there's no help forthcoming. Why's that? Someday, I hope we ask why the police and law enforcement is the way it is (even if we've made peace with their pernicious incompetence and inherent tendencies to be criminals themselves), why those with even the smallest connections can swivel out even after doing something so abhorrent and blood-curdling. \n\nTheir true motivations behind committing this horrific crime - we might never truly know nor should we put too much stock in the musings or reasonings of filthy, despicable subhuman criminals. Criminals say the dardest things to rationalise and justify their proclivities. I feel that the least we can do, what we can meaningfully bring reform to, is policy, law enforcement, courts doing their work etc. and if we can do that, we can at least begin to affect some change, provide much-needed support to those who go through this unimaginable ordeal, and deliver justice.",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Stories by @sarviving. At the end of the day it becomes a joke for everyone except women who know that someday it could be them in the same place as the victim. He recently did a podcast about 2 weeks back and discussed his abortion controversy. It's so insensitive. I really wish for more people to see this and understand it especially after everything this week. India cannot have the same level of \"dark comedians\" as jimmy carr not because of leftists but because of the society which will internalise this joke and think that its ok to do such things to people. Even if you don't admit it, as a society we are way behind western societies and unlike them the majority mass who listens to this does not know how to differentiate between a joke and reality. This is so important and I wish his followers to see this too!",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Men need to start holding their friends and peers accountable. If you see another man harassing a women or even saying something demeaning about women when you guys are alone, don’t brush it off. Say something. Men tend to respect other men infinitely more than they respect women. Never liked him or his jokes, 17 year old incels have given him the limelight in the name of \"dank humour\" Are these recent tweets, or old ones? I have watched this interview. In it, he mentions that he has made mistakes in the past and has (or still has) a bad habit of doubling down at first when someone corrects him (as he was himself bullied for a long time and it is his learned coping mechanism). He has learned that certain things should not be made fun of, and as a performer, he only wants to perform so that he can serve his parents and not make similar mistakes in the future. His tweet on abortion is in very bad taste. I did not follow this guy, might have seen one or two videos which keeps coming randomly in reels. He should do better. He looks like an immature and may be his followers as someone said is like teenagers, so they feel it is cool but this is irresponsible if some 20 year olds follow him. The Kusha roast was fairly recent. Hardly a few months ago. So? Kusha Kapila is an adult, who knowingly participated in the roast show where she knew who was going to attend and what was going to happen, these are supposedly all friends from the \"industry\". If she had any issues with the jokes made, she could have disallowed the airing of the episode like another guest on the show Ashneer Grover. But she did not, although I am told she has on occasion regretted some of the jokes, but the episode is still up and she is not without resources to get them down as they did censor a lot of the jokes. Dude it's not a girl's duty to take down bullshit on the internet. That's like saying, people will continue speaking shit about women. And if women have a problem, they should take time off and bring down every content individually. And for your VERY kind information, taking down the entire episode would lead to financial losses, which is why she didn't do it. But she requests the OP to cut out the indecent bit of \"roast\" that is beeped out in the show. So, please stop the mental gymanstics to prove that a man talking shit about a girl is her fault. 😃 That girl, Kusha Kapila, is a much bigger (and older, timewise in the industry) star than both Samay and Ashish combined. She came on the show knowing what she was getting into, and she allowed the episode to go/stay on the air as she had no objections. The part she did have objections to was censored. It is not a random video that someone made without her consent; she took part in it, was there to see its shoot/edit, and was involved in other points before the YouTube upload. If at any given point she had an issue, or if today she thinks she would rather not have that video up on YouTube, I am quite sure that Kusha Kapila has the resources to get the whole video taken down, regardless of the financial burden to comic Ashish Solanki. So stop infantilising Kusha Kapila. I am quite sure she knows what she is doing if she has allowed the video to be up. Boss, the point of the matter is Samay talking shit about women, trivilializing incidents like R*PE and Kusha's matter is just another matter in his entire line of destructive \"dank\" comedy. I'm just talking about the part that Kusha felt had to be BEEPED out. Samay shouldn't have said that in the first place. Does not matter if Kusha can take it down or no. Kusha was aware it was a roast, not that her personal life would be unfolded and crass things would be spoken about her personal life. IMHO he's an easy target, the standards of our lawmakers, most of them with criminal cases are not questioned with the severity with which a non politician is target online...keyboard warriors and armchair opinion se ghanta fark padta hai... Unfortunately the standards of people who can actually make a difference in our country (Read: Members of parliament) is pretty low, unless they are held accountable ye news ek week k baad sadly sirf ek footnote bann k reh jayega. P.S - Not a fan of the comedian, actively avoid the crass on social media to keep my sanity Dank culture just isn't going well with India. It has just become a tool to normalise misogyny and hate towards other communities. 1. My initial reply to this post was to ask if Samay has done it again, as just recently in the podcast he said he has learned his lesson and does not wish to repeat the same. On his Twitter/X account, as far as I know, the last post was on the 9th of March 2024, so he could not have made any posts about the current incident. I could not check replies, as I am not on Twitter/X. 2. Again, Kusha agreed to the format of the roast; others before her on the same show have had similar or worse said about them. If she was okay with the format of the roast, she knew that roasters would come to talk about her divorce. I am not 100% sure, but others did joke about that as well. She could have, at any point, halted the process, but she did not, and as it is on the air, it is not too much to assume that she is okay with it. The video being still up and no negative remarks from Kusha, who has literally made her career out of social media by making comments and being vocal, makes it a non-issue. She is the main person here; any secondary hurt supposedly taken on her behalf by anyone else is pointless. So censoring artists will stop this kind of brutual assualt right? If tommorow government comes up with permanent ban on porn there will be meltdown all over the internet. censorship isnt the right way... It is not a comedian's fault that his jokes are taken as it is in real world by some immature teen wanting to be dank....not his/her fault that everyone has access to internet so easily these days. Hold the lawmakers accountable.... somehow women are seen as a lesser human being in our country. If we have to start censorship start with indian cinemas then which have objectified women ruthlessly over the years.... If a person fails to differentiate a artist's narration from reality it is not the artist's fault.... 1. Didn't see he made a post on the current incident. Was speaking only about the roast to tell you that he might have deleted the tweets. But his \"jokes\" on women are still crass. So, definitely not something he \"regrets\". 2. I don't know if you were there in the show. But the part that was beeped out was about her s*x life, post-divorce. This is the problematic part that Samay said. I'm not talking about the divorce bit. She is also OK with those jokes. The part where she is not ok is beeped out. She has expressed her views a week ago and answered your question \"why didn't she not halt the process\". This is what Emma Watson intended when she started the #HeforShe campaign. Man the hate she received after that for years on end. So many men still hate her for being a feminist. Sometimes I wonder why do women keep breeding with such freaks. We need to dismantle patriarchy and casteism is this country is to ever stop being the hellhole that it is Yup this is so true. I have heard my \"friends\" say some of the most crass shit , I usually reduce contact with them to not deal with it, but it's better to say something. \"Fear of cancellation from the left is why we don't have comics like Andrew Schulz, Jimmy Carr, Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais in the Indian comedy scene\" Yeah the Indore BJP unit a real hardcore Marxist-Leninist organisation filled with comrades. What an absolute fucking clown. This nation is beyond saving at this point, just try to leave it if you can. We can try but it won't change as long as the general populace is filled with morons This guy is an ass. He just copied standup ideas from Hollywood and his fans thinks that he always think outside the box and he never sounds funny to me Ye sala degenerate aur iski following bhi Bc pure desh ke youth ko beemar kiya hai in jaise bhdwo ne dank jokes ke naam par Kaise bhdwo ko crorepati bana diya hai iss desh ke chutiyo ne Exactly, this is an entirely baseless discourse which keeps us from having genuine discussions on the state of law enforcement and judiciary in this country. Samay Raina's audience is not even 1% of India, probably not even half of 1%. This is exactly why every time some thing happens in this country, meaningful conversations get detailed cause they start bringing up perfunctory bullshit. I am far from a fan of this guy, not even his target audience, but this is absurd to me. Can you share some copied bits? Why the downvotes? We as a society need to pay more respect to people who say things we don’t like. As to many people Freedom of thought/expression is only good till it does not conflict with their POV. He apologized for some of the jokes he made moreover explained us why he would do certain things did. This is called being responsible and mature, contrary to what this thread believes him to be. And your text has so much superiority complex but you even fail to read and understand the 1st comment by canismajoris177 >jokes Think you're reaching a bit there. I sat through one of his sets. Felt more like he copied whatsapp jokes. Usually comedians 'punch up'. Make jokes about privileged people, the rich, the politicians, the government, the police. I don't really begrudge comedians making a joke or two about any topic. But what they are looking for is validation from their audience. Making jokes about women constantly thats demeaning and not funny when clearly women are fighting to be treated equally in India and struggling with violence from strangers and family alike along with the burden of expectations of society. Even if its comedy, it just shows a lack of maturity and critical thinking in the audience. IF that is your only material. Samay is in his mid 20's and either he's not mature enough or is just purely pandering to his audience and doesnt believe in jokes. Even Tanmay Bhat who's target audience is kids has his friends on youtube to comment on videos they mostly keep it PG and try not to cross the line. And pray tell what these reasons are? Why would he make fun of somebody's s*x life post divorce? Why, before, would he make fun of a r*pe case? He would be mature and responsible if he controlled his \"dank\" comedy. I might forget the tweets because they're old and he \"apologised\". But the roast is not some 2 year old thing... It's a few months old. Honestly in certain instances freedom is given but in all instances the information put up by someone with a different POV is just blatantly ignored. Case in point- Fanneykhan failed to acknowledge that an apology was given along with explanations and standards were set by the person. His fans are just jobless incels who might be rapists too, who knows? Why do ppl even like him, he is jokes are MID AT THE MOST. Ok I understand, this boils down to the roast. Would you be mad about the jokes even IF Kusha harself had no problems whatsoever? Curious. Finally someone speaking about this clown And his followers are like Ye dank hai Lord samay raina They call him supreme leader lol Punching down is not good humour. He's never been funny at all. Go and report his Youtube channel. Ye Chuti\\* bhi girega like Mr. Beast. It is not about this one idiot specifically, it is about the root of the problem. Give a man a fish and he eats for one day, teach him to fish and he never goes hungry fits perfectly here as an example. You can put 1000s a day in prison, but that means 1000 crimes have been committed. The guilty need to be treated by the law, but the goal in any developed society is to not have to need to use the law. This is what the message is about. No one says you do not have to improve the laws and on a whole next level the enforcement of those laws. The discourse is far from baseless. mai samja nhi iss post ka point ,joke pasand nhi ki aap bol rahe ho in jokes ke wajah logo aur misogynist ban rhe h ? if it is the latter it doesn't make any sense coz it is meant to be taken as a joke aur jo log aise jokes sunke actually woman ki ijjat nhi kar rhe ,unme koi dikkat hai ,its like saying guns waale game khelne se tum gangster ban jaoge aise jokes bas sunke bhulne ke liye hote hai aur baat rahi humuor ki woh subjective kisiko hassi ayegi kisi ko nhi I remember someone saying - \"All stand-up comedians in India start out as bullies.\" And, whatever news I read about any stand-up comedian from our beloved country; they prove that statement right. I remember what Jimmy Carr said. \"You can joke about anything, but not with anyone\". I joke about religion, which is okay with some and not with others. You joke of holocaust, which is okay with some if it's well executed, but definitely not with many. There are several comedians who make \"funny\" jokes on abortion too. It's always the way it's executed and ffs, read the room! Context is the key or else everything this offensive. I get what you mean but comedians, the film industry, art and Music industry is an important part of culture and society. Fast media actually plays a big role in influencing youth it's important to talk about it too. It is also important to talk how movies like animals were not helping anyone. It's not a completely meaningless discourse, it's small but it comes under micro aggression and casual mysogyny which is pretty normalized. This is not even dark humour. This is just crass. Ah yes, the infallible narrative of attacking jokes to protect women. That's what all of these rapists have in common. A sense of humor. >We as a society need to pay more respect to people who say things we don’t like. The things they say and joke about in question: Rape, women's murder, pedophilia. why people listen to him. whatever he says,writes I'd not funny. that's outright lying offensive. it is very unfortunate that this corrupted incel mentality is marketed by these weird influencers with no conscience, or any moral responsibility for their actions. plus whoever is consuming such content,mostly young audience will also get influenced by this soft yet poisonous normalized of degenerate behavior by these idols. indecent behavior should be punished-at least socially,not rewarded by making such weirdos-celebrities. He also cancelled all shows in kolkata recently and raised his voice against the case. These are all immature jokes and that's that. I mean they are bad jokes but still jokes. If you want to call out call out actual rapists and assaulters The things they say in question is canismajoris117’s first comment. That comment dismantles a lot of things being discussed on this thread yet it is not given enough respect and cross examined. This dumbfuck is quoting Ricky Gervais and Jimmy Carr who are very left wing and he's calling out the left. What a fucking tool. If Kusha had no problem, I wouldn't too. :) Ok, I am going to be downvoted to oblivion but f it. \"Jokes\" such as these, humourous or not should be seen as what they are - jokes, just because some people then base their perception of reality based on them should not be the reason why they should be demonized. Freedom of speech should not be culled just because some dumb people take these kinds of jokes seriously, or parrot them. That is what has been enshrined in the constitution. Just to conclude, I am not saying that \"jokes\" such as this should be encouraged nor am I saying that whatever this \"comedian\" has said is correct. But what I am saying is that a societal attitude becomes the precedent, and when that happens freedom of speech is suppress where it is required the most. Jokes doesn't make people do illegal things. A joke is just a joke. Some maybe in bad taste but it's not illegal to have bad jokes. You can go around cancelling people all you want but that would solve the problem. How many people do you think even watch samay raina? The problem is obviously bigger than an individual making some jokes. I also learned abusive words from GTA when I was like 12-13. That doesn't mean I go around calling people that. Indian people's sense of right and wrong is horribly skewed. It's because people are so divided and think they are a part of hierarchy such atrocities are committed. These people do not see people of other religion, caste, even sex as equal. That's where the problem lie. I don't normally speak on these topics but I have to talk about this egregious misunderstanding of what humor means, fundamentally. Shock humor isn't funny because it's true and \"affirming misogyny\" or any other such bullcrap. Shock humor is well, meant to shock. If you don't like it, don't follow him. The point of shock humor is to joke about taboos, about things that are normally taken very seriously by society. Shock humor doesn't normalise anything. It's funny precisely because it's abnormal, outside the normal, something so absurd that you have to laugh at it. That absurdism is being completely missed here. Why is the abortion joke funny? Because it's relating something serious (abortion) to something so trivial as deleting a tweet. You might think that's in bad taste, but that's just you getting your panties in a twist. Point taken, and no doubt these elements of media do influence certain sections of society. However, I feel that these incidents occur, we get rightly angry, we start asking questions of the dispensation and the state of law & order in the country which is 200% correct, and then idk maybe cause we are ultimately so powerless towards ever affecting change in that direction, we start pulling out our own little axes to grind. This case has nothing to do with some chindi dindi rich ass influencer with whom probably not even 0.5% of India's youth interact or relate with any manner. Yes, we should definitely talk about the prevalence of misogyny and social ills - gender roles are enforced, women are actively and subtly treated as property, their agency is numbed to the extent that their personal development is heavily stunted, moulded by a constant state of panic. Between women dropping out of schools, the workforce, and being shoved inside the bus of arranged (forced, or pushed into through manipulation) marriage and being turned into accessories to be used by men, the core issue remains that despite the constitution stating so, despite laws being obligated to do so, there's no help forthcoming. Why's that? Someday, I hope we ask why the police and law enforcement is the way it is (even if we've made peace with their pernicious incompetence and inherent tendencies to be criminals themselves), why those with even the smallest connections can swivel out even after doing something so abhorrent and blood-curdling. Their true motivations behind committing this horrific crime - we might never truly know nor should we put too much stock in the musings or reasonings of filthy, despicable subhuman criminals. Criminals say the dardest things to rationalise and justify their proclivities. I feel that the least we can do, what we can meaningfully bring reform to, is policy, law enforcement, courts doing their work etc. and if we can do that, we can at least begin to affect some change, provide much-needed support to those who go through this unimaginable ordeal, and deliver justice. And then he has gall to compare himself to someone like Jimmy Carr. Jimmy has a stage persona that is very much not like who he is. You can compare his interviews with his stage or tv work. This guy's tweets show there's no mask of edgy persona. He's just a run of the mill moron. The only reason I watched him was his involvement in chess. Besides, comics like jimmy carrr whom I actively watch strictly keep things on stage and off stage be it on podcasts or twitter he is extremely wise and understanding I didn't even knew this guy existed until now. And I think this guy should be bullied for this. If we bully them for this they might understand why it's bad to joke about this. Maybe bullying can have more positive effect on this guy. Je is as hole I knew it thts why NVR watched any of his show online or offline is it that time of month when humour isnt allowed? But his audience is all immature denk ke 14 who might take and say many things unironically. Audience ki age ka sochna chahiye. hmmm what an amazing insight. why dont you write a book or two to steal disposable income off gullibles? Just to clarify, the comedian not the account owner who's pointing his mysogynist jokes. Haha all the comedian he mentioned have right wing fan base, and their fans hates women and minority. Yeo and you should not speak. I am all in for dark jokes. But so you know what was Chandigarh case ? And how he was joking about it ? That wasn't funny but he was doing it for clout. And in his latest show, there are too many jokes about \"Teri maa chodunga/chod ta hun/chod di\" Just cheap jokes tgat 12 year olds find funny each time you say it no hard work to write jokes. Free ka clout lelo aur outrage ho toh ro do thoda sa. Thank you for explaining this. It's not for everybody. If you don't like it, ignore it. Do something cheap, apologize for it and then do it again. Hey man, if you don't find it funny don't watch it. But it's inaccurate and misleading to say his jokes actually *cause harm*. You can criticize his humor for being unfunny all you want, but when you say that his humor is actively harmful that's taking it too far. Not quite sure who he is or what his followers are like - but he is definitely right. If he’s a comedian - jokes are jokes. Whoever finds them funny will follow him, whoever does not should not. India is a country where people are blaming comedians for the degenerates that are brought up here, when the problem actually is deeply rooted in this culture. Scotland has way more of these “dark humour” comedians and guess what, men there aren’t quite as degenerate as they are here. They listen to jokes, laugh and move on. It's more than just that, it's this constant battle between those who recognise the value of free speech and those who will use tragedies to curtail it. The cycle goes something like this: 1. Bad thing happens 2. Edgy person jokes about it too soon 3. \"You find it funny? That means you find the bad thing that happened funny! You are a bad person for laughing at the joke!\" 4. Cancel this guy, ban him from the internet It goes on and on and on. >Why do ppl even like him, he is jokes are MID AT THE MOST. Okay so I follow him and been doing so since initial days of his streaming career, he is not the guy you see on reels even he is not happy with people sharing random bits with \"india is not ready for his humor\". he is funny (subjective term) and genuine on his streams and even I didn't like his standup videos apart from one comicstan set. Now, that joke was problematic for indian audience, I agree but he did give clarification later with which I could also relate. >His fans are just jobless incels who might be rapists too, who knows? I have a job and I'm not an incel either. I don’t, I ended up friendless , i only have one gf and one female friend, other than that i just know few people, they’re not my friend anymore What a useless post. R@es are committed by your slum level population. Not your samay raina and corporate colleagues. Sure there is sexual harassment and you should confront it with regulations but no samay raina is not doing r@es, neither do educated class. It is done by civil volunteer (local strongman from underprivileged background). I just calligraphied part of this post because it just loudly rang true. With a bit of rephrasing: *\"Demeaning behaviours are encouraged silently;* *Violence is normalised in laughter;* *And misogyny is fuelled by \"Haha! It's just a dank joke.\"\"* Sometimes the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls. This is true. The jokes are to be made with respect to the crowd around you. Problem is with social media, the crowd is huge. So they leave the crowd aspect out and focus on their own audience, who may be a considerable protion of the crowd. Just like this post, idl samay raina but i do know vir das. Some of his jokes do go too far, but its ok as he is making that joke for that crowd in that event, some people posted it online and now its ok with some and not ok with others. He is not wrong but he is not right either. Apparently there is no way around it apart from not touching those issues for jokes at all. Like some of the US comedian, they are not that famous but the jokes are good and not a touchy topic. I think all stand up comedian who yry to get famous fast stand start out as bullies. Specifically taking on those aspects which are hot topics and make jokes out of it. This is the same in youtube vids as well as news as well. Political analysis and comments are way more attracting than facts of the case. Thats why news went from primary information disbursal to primary opinion formation all over the world. I don't think anyone listens to a joke and thinks it's ok to do such things. The reaction generally is \"wow, that's funny\". We won't reach the levels of western comics by curtailing free speech. I'm not here to defend anyone, but if someone gets offended by a comedian's jokes, that's their problem. The real issue is people being perfectly fine with rapists ruling them, running the sports federation, and turning any woman who dares to confront these scumbag politicians into an 'anti-national.' Stop wasting time worrying about what comedians said years ago and start focusing on the corrupt rapist politicians who are actually screwing up the country. Han bhai MMS case pe insensitive kamedey kar di. Funny toh hoga hi. Maine tumko galat bol diya toh main cancel culture. Unfunny hona galat nahi hai meri jaan 😙 There is a difference between a potty mouth and a bad person / psychopath. We have seen sweet talking well mannered psychopaths and good hearted potty mouths ... However, samay raina should remember dumbledore's quote... \"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedy it\" Yeah, this. People support rapists. They support abusive psychopaths. They are ok with abuse meted out to people whom they consider inferior. The category varies - can be women, can be LGBTQ community, can be autistic poeple, can be religion or caste based, or skin colour based. But the fact is, it's people's hatred of certain sections, and fetish for charming and manipulative psychopaths that allows this to happen. Well actually there are many cases of rape in the US and other countries where famous people get away with it all the time..............until years or decades later. Lots of powerful and rich people abuse and rape others with no repercussions or consequences. For example, Roman Polanski the famous director raped a 13 year old child in the US and fled to France where he lives scot free even now. Even won an Oscar award........ Rare L Samay But, that's the thing. A comedian need not be in a neutral ground. And diplomacy isn't even a thing in comedy. Comedians aren't politicians. Any mild joke can get a random person offended. Indians need to grow a spine to ignore a joke on social media if it's not intended for them. You can't open a Ricky Gervais video on YouTube and cry he offended my christian beliefs. You're just not the audience for that joke.. Some of his jokes are not funny just because he's trying to be dark and trying too much. But some of his jokes are really funny bhai, At end of the day he's just joking and there is freedom of speech for everyone. I think that jokes he made on Kusha were unfunny and demeaning but in the end they were only jokes. Insensitive hona bhi ni hai. Bilkul well im a loner in my classroom. but whatever im fine being alone than with perverts and creeps. apparently im boring and a pussy for not being able to digest \"humour\" they say Not the point. Just because something happens in us (case in point 'dank comedians ') doesnt mean its appropriate. Or good. That is the point. I agree with you, amd yet it feels like his popularity among young adult and teen boys is worrisome. Because people laughing at his jokes normalises casual misogyny, makes it look acceptable and even encouraged Reply me bhi *BC* & *bh***wa*??? Irony samajhta hai? If you knew about him, he has been bullied in his childhood I hate this mf Yeah no i don't like men joking about women being forced to give an abortion and calling that humour. But you do you, i guess I can’t wait for the day Samay Raina is canceled What a douche , I can understand your point to not criticize a comedian for his jokes but saying only underprivileged class do r*pes is totally delusional opinion. You could say more r*ped are done by underprivileged because of the education they lack and many other aspects. I am only pointing out recent cases , do you think prajwal revanna was underprivileged or that recent corporate engineers cases where they gangr* their female colleague in a party , or this kolkata case in which hospital interns(future doctors) are alleged suspects . This country has 80% population of underprivileged so obviously that would be majority of them doing things like that . Your comment is so absurd Sexual harassment are done by educated men(proximity, power dynamics). This is common in India or west, brij Bhushan, rewanna and Harvey weinstein. India has a unique problem of violent rape and murder, this is covered by slum men who don't give f about reddit. Only solution is to keep them away for female. And FYI which corporate engineers gangr@ed a colleague ( grudge FIR doesn't become reality, ppl won't give up their job and life to r@e a colleague when corporate guys can afford best Hooker of india). Sali lying to defend chawl insects. When corporate guys can afford the best hooker ? are you seriously that dumb? you dont even have an idea of how psychology works . If they could just fulfill their hunger by hookers then rape might never happen . Violent r*pe and murder happen in west too . Its all in the mindset and psychology . One man can be well educated but can also has a very violent mindset . There are several books and movies and even series made on this issue . You dont have a goddamn clue about this . Poverty and lack of education are factors but they are not the only ones . What corporate guys- almost all of em , how much do you earn Chawl niwasi. Tell me which corporate employees will have incentive to do rape and their lucrative careers. Movies and series are your learning tool, Chawl nivasi indeed."
