The only ventilation is through the small window over bed, which I refuse to call a window btw, and that too isn't effective because in Bangalore construction on property lines without any offsets. There's literally no space for air to come from outside. And on the inside there are those freaking walls again. Forget any sunlight.

Look for a house in a more affordable neighborhood??\n\nI can understand rent is quite expensive in the city in general but I just want to say that there are nice neighborhoods in the suburbs that are cheaper than this. If you pick one one in KR Puram area you'll not be that far away from the IT corridor while having all the amenities you want, thats for North Bangalore. \n\nThe fact that it costs that much is because people are paying that much, thats how the market works. The population influx is quite massive, I dont think there is any concerted effort in any city in the country to match housing with influx of population its something private sector does - already at quite a fast pace. If there were a large number of choices then it would be a buyer's market but its not. I am sorry I dont mean to antagonise anyone but its just how things are. I know people who live in much better houses, in nicer neighborhoods paying in 10-15k range.",

    "light_cleaned_comments": "Bangalore is a scam city. I'm never going back there. They even gave you the air vent so Freddy fazbear can jumpscare you at night Yeah me neither. Wow! This is really bad. Hopefully no one ends up taking this shit Does RK mean raddi-khana, a small room to store your raddi? **If you have problem with Bangalore then go back to....** Oh wait... Halloween Moment üëª I wonder why there are so many switches. Two rooms combined in my home don't have that many switches. But Banglore weaTher bRo. Brooo, I'm raddi : ) This is a toilet converted into a bedroom. üò≤ üò° üò† I read it as **randi** my bad... üëª Each switch transforms the bed into a killing machine (read the story *A Terribly Strange Bed*) I think this image is a bit misleading. [More pictures of the space. ](https://www.nobroker.in/property/1-rk-apartment-for-rent-in-mahadevapura-bangalore-for-rs-12000/8a9ff68287522a1a018752aacd5a2a81/detail?nbFr=list-rent&source=listpageCard&isDetailV2=false) That's smaller than most of bathroom in tire 2 Still fits 2.5 lakh deposit I lived in a place like this for 4 months in 2019. Paid 8k as rent. Desperate times. Ayo introvert bhai kaise ho It is a toilet Not a flex, but my toilet is bigger than that bedroom. Actually it's 50K. Yes but the inhabitant barely does. Bro it's too much space. You can fit in your wOrK DeSk as well ! /s Even a prison cell is bigger than that Bro pic a LOT misleading. This rand op That makes it even more funny üòÇüòÇ Yeah, the room is shit, especially for the price, but OP chose the most misleading picture. Hostels are far better than this and many charge around 5-7k and offer other amenities Hooww? What still bro? There's a wall in the middle of the room till halfway and a bed that you can't climb on because there's a fridge at top and walls all around. Next to the bed is the bathroom and next to bathroom is kitchen, because fuck hygiene. The only ventilation is through the small window over bed, which I refuse to call a window btw, and that too isn't effective because in Bangalore construction on property lines without any offsets. There's literally no space for air to come from outside. And on the inside there are those freaking walls again. Forget any sunlight. How the hell is anyone supposed to stay sane here especially if you have wfh and would stay 5 days cooped up here? Reminder to self. Never apply for jobs in bangalore. ü¶úu right bro, but the title and the image are misleading af. where? I'm looking for a place rich now in Bangalore. will pay 15k. pls DM me the contact R u playing Minecraft? But still the bangalore weather...Sakkidhe bro yeah atleast in Mumbai you can just say Mumbai spirit and continue suffering All valid had you posted the other pics too. Shittiest things made to sound fancy. Truest representation of Bangalore. I moved out and liveing with my parents. Best decision ever made You're basically paying for the superb Bangalore weather through that window. Wait.. Reminded me of Ross' apartment hunting with Chandler and Joey That's why you get the air vent , delhi mai vo bhi nahi denge Lol every instagram comment section about Bangalore ever. Holdoon u went before? It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúBed‚Äùroom Very misleading. Saw the real pics. Bhai mere yaha full class 2 kamra 3 hazar me milta hai \\*sprite Okay dont pay 12k for a 1RK in Mahadevpura. Look for a house in a more affordable neighborhood?? I can understand rent is quite expensive in the city in general but I just want to say that there are nice neighborhoods in the suburbs that are cheaper than this. If you pick one one in KR Puram area you'll not be that far away from the IT corridor while having all the amenities you want, thats for North Bangalore. The fact that it costs that much is because people are paying that much, thats how the market works. The population influx is quite massive, I dont think there is any concerted effort in any city in the country to match housing with influx of population its something private sector does - already at quite a fast pace. If there were a large number of choices then it would be a buyer's market but its not. I am sorry I dont mean to antagonise anyone but its just how things are. I know people who live in much better houses, in nicer neighborhoods paying in 10-15k range. This just looks like a poorly designed apartment, but nowhere near an issue like OP is trying to make it out to be. Is this a bedroom for ANTS? [this fits appropriately](https://youtu.be/DenlS7VdATk?feature=shared) Even some jails are more comfortable than this . Lmao same What does RK mean? Come with Real ID Mumbai. Kinda like that in Canada for many new Indian immigrants Wow we are so close to Singapore coffin homes. It's a room with attached toilet. There is enough room for a bunkbed. Could have shared with another person :) If i am not mistaken, it means rupees. I think it's about 143 $ A queen size bedroom! It's a bathroom with a mattress. Room and kitchen More like a Luxurious Jail cell. i will pay for this Is Bangalore the most expensive city to rent in? Japan capsule hotel vibes The entire city is out to get you. I want to get out of this shit hole but RTO is a thing now. Looks like it was a bathroom stall once upon a time Report to local council. They are voilating all building laws here. So before 1RK it was a 1TK. Bit? The post is definitely misleading. The mentions 1 Rk and the room is 1 rk. Op is using banglore hate to get upvotes by posting misleading content. All are fools here. Its 1 Rk written on the ad. Op is misleading. If you call that a bed than I don't know what life is outside my home....... Kothi Bangla check ‚òëÔ∏è Banta GB Road Sex room That window gives it some serious jail cell vibes. To be honest I‚Äôve seen flats like these in Mumbai and the brokers demand 1 month rent as brokerage plus yearly brokerage of 1 month rent Umm satire? In Bangalore? I stay in PG for 15k rn and it's a shared room. This is slightly on the higher side, but around 10 12k is common.. Finally. Someone gets satire : ) wtf is RK.? Room kitchen : ) Nope. Mumbai takes that crown. But it really depends across the city. You can get something better in Mumbai for less if you're in the outskirts and nothing for 5x this amount if you're in downtown. It's the opposite in Bangalore due to all the IT job influx. Outskirts is crazy costly. Tf they care : ) I don't even think they take permits for such houses.. Same in Bangalore if you go through a broker. this is a real thing. my late brother used to live in a mess room like this while studying in Ramaih uni. 16% of people get injured by rolling off the bed, you are safe. Be happy. /s Delhi may itne rent may 1 bhk to mil hi jayega Your peiorities are sorted I'm sorry.. It‚Äôs mattress storage area for the whole building There is no T in RK and TK... Just K good to have sex, atleast you won't fall off, and if her brother or boyfriend turns up, you can hide below the bed with 3 walls surrounding you. Corporate slaves oh look another misleading post in this psychotic sub, who would have guessed. I guess, I lucked out in terms of living space. I rented 3 houses during the course 4 years living in Bangalore in the range of 10-13k and only 2/3 of the landlords were scammers who stole deposit money. # FullyFurnished Hey at least the weather is great I've lived in one of these for 10k üòÇ Aree fellow introvert ü´Ç Accha hai.. jhaadu nhi maarna padega. Whyyy People with claustrophobia have left the chat What are they showing in other 18 photos? I want that room No I felt myself killed when i saw 12k for this room If it is fully furnished like that and the rent and deposit is as stated (which is never going to be the case) then this is a great deal tbh, considering mahadevpura is one of the more expensive localities. I want contact me How are the prisons in Bangalore?Bet they got more room than this If he has already left Bangalore, he needs to come back to Bangalore and leave again. Mumbai mein itne mein 10 log rehte hai. Looks like train compartment. Such a nice room in Mahadevpura for only 12000. What a great Landlord. Yehi cheez Japan mein ho toh waah waah? /s So Bangalore real estate's conversion to Mumbai is complete! Yet you wanna title the post as if blr is the only city in this country where all this happens. Sir I‚Äôve experienced people trying to get max money out of me for substandard services/product in every part of this country especially tier2&3 cities much more than blr. Why the clickbait title? Why the rage mongering? This is the behaviour of all Indians, taking advantage of the situation and making max money possible no matter how when and where. This is india special not bangalore special Welcome to Hong Kong. Is it a bathroom turned into a roomüòÇ Underrated comment Kitne paise milta hain yahaan rehne ke liye?? Mumabi says hi Mumbai folks confused why people are not jumping on such a great offer! 12k only for a 1RK! So spacious! It's a toilet with attached room So nobody digs under the bed and runs off with the toilet pipes Bro is precise af Need to contact the owner just so that I can abuse him/her A fucking rat's rafter I am with you. This is smaller than many prison cells. The idiots defending here are doing that only because they consider it as some grave insult to Bangalore or something. Idk man I find it kinda cosy How is it misleading. I looked at all the pics. I got stressed just looking at it. It's even worse if you see all the pics. I thought there is atleast a good common bathroom. But no. The entire thing is confined in a small area. It's worse than many prisons This has begun in India as well I see We can go to jail and probably get a bigger space for no rent arent we all Charge 30,000+ 5000 maintenance üòá 6 months advanced deposit Learning from Canada I see This is a luxury in Japan LOL üòÇ Bhai 2 bhk in decent places It's been converted. The room was much bigger but split into 2 rooms. far better if don't care about privacy On the bright side, you won't fall off the bed even if you tried. Foyers in regular homes are bigger than this. People would be better off buying a 10x10 plot and building a kaccha house in here. Would Bangalore being Bangalore. Im feeling claustrophobic seeing this 1 RK - 1 Room Kakkoos. Bangalore at its peak inflation Looks like congress aur gandhis ka ganda kaam This is not the bangalore I left. This is for sure just a one off parody advertisement guys. Probably because the flat is near a major work hub and you can save a ton of money on travel and time.. It‚Äôs about priorities habibi come to MUMBAI if u really looking for room... search in el city Cell of a modern capitalist wage slave Its a convertible bathroom Looks more like Jail for mentally challenged criminals. 'Cozy bedroom' in London, only one lakh rupees per month rent! / s \"A luxurious 1RK with a state-of-the-art air vent to vent your feelings and unwind after a long day of work.\" When Bangalore tries to be NY YE KOI RADDI KHANA HAI? after seeing this **depressing** room ...i feel, **JAIL** will be more *chill and relaxing** sanctum. Not me desperately trying to tap left and right to see more pictures of the room out of habit. That‚Äôs how desperate Bangalore makes you Is this available? Asking for a friend are you trying to challenge mumbai? Screw RTO get out of the city, you‚Äôll find life more peaceful trust me tf really?? Contact the owner and ask him to gut himself and try to fit his tonnes of unprocessed shit into this 1/4 RK jail cell. Location : Cental Jail That‚Äôs a little sus a friend of a friend lives in same sized pg, but less than that prize and with food. This looks like Jail saw a very similar one in delhi but it had a slab/sink attached to put the Kitchen in the RK That's what he said Delhi mein air toh mile pehle, phir air vent denge üòÇ *just wishes to be in this friend circle* Dukh, dard, peeda : ) >Yet you wanna title the post as if blr is the only city in this country where all this happens. Because this is from Bangalore? I never compared it to anyone. Just that this sucks : ( That makes things awkward, cause I'm from Mumbai : ) I WANT to!! I'm from Mumbai and it's so much better, atleast for me: ) ü´Çü´Çü´Ç Bangalore ki Maa ka ..loot Macha ke rakha hai haramiyo ne. Laalchi darinde sab ke sab. üòÇ Ye Koi Raddi Khana hai....... reminds me of General Bakshi.... Looks cozy :) Taking ‚Äúonly come home to carsh at night‚Äù very seriously lol. Someone has posted an original no-broker link here somewhere so yeah it's true. Aur baaki 18 pics mein kya dikhaya phir? Jagah toh hai nahi For people who are worried about falling of the bed. Might as well keep the T for tatti. It would be really funny if the toilet was spacious All hail NoBroker! üë®üèª‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è hell* This gives the vibes of Kaala Paani type of prison . Just the difference is that the paint is bright and there is a tubelight inside . I want to see rest of the pictures.. please ü•∫üòÇ Where is the room? I don't see a problem , it's clean and in Bangalore people earn good to afford this Woah woah woah, slowdown landowner!! At this rate you will have antilia with a helipad for toy helicopter landing. Is there a kitchen inside the grill?? Lele bro acha h ho ske toh price negotiate krlio 11999 ho Jaye toh perfect deal h Kya TK? Sir iss room me kuch b nei TK. Wait there's 19 pictures? We need to see more of this beautifully designed house. Agree. My parents took me there. Was there for 15yrs. Left it frustrated and depressed. Best decision ever made . My cats are so much happier and have doubled in number as well. Just the honking kills me, I have had migraine since I was 15. I wake up from sleep if my cat walks into my room or just stares at me. Imagine the horror of living next to malls, traffic, constant honking, mobile towers, transformers, generators. Not to forget the frustration amongst the locals on a daily basis. I mean what's up with 'not smiling' ??? What does a smile cost and why is everyone in a hurry? Don't they know every moment alive is one step towards death? Then why not slow down and breathe? Maybe let a pedestrian cross first rather than honking at them. Maybe smile back rather than stare? Open bathroom concept... the ad says: > With premium amenities such as servant room, waste treatment plant & gas pipeline this home provides you with many added benefits. If you are looking for a home with internet, this home is just right for you. I think someone's letting out the servant room. It's sad that someone must be made to live in such an apartment. Low key I'll like to make a bed like this for myself, I'm one of those people who sleep while my body is resting on the wall and this will be perfect for doing it on both sides. Is something broken? The button is supposed to be \"report owner\" Right? And the window looks like a train window. Wtf when a bathroom was converted into a bedroom this post got famousüóø Forget wall to wall carpets, this \"room\" has wall to wall bedding What's RTO? Transport office? Lmao whatttttüòÇüòÇüòÇ Atleast there's bed. In Mumbai you won't even get Bed.. it's just unfurnished 1RK flat at this price üí∞ Yeah and why does the listing have 19 pics?ü§£"
