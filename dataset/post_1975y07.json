I paid nearly Rs300 for this and all Zomato has to say is sorry for the inconvenience. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm paying money to just deal with their customer care and not for food. Horrible experience . I even mailed them\nBut still there was no point. Is there anyway to get back at them ?",

        "tbf it looks like an empty cup, where did everything spill? i think they need more evidence of that",
        "Trueee, Swiggy is the all time OG! I never had such complaints with Swiggy‚Äôs customer care. They‚Äôre never getting back I guess! Had a similar issue, sent more than 10 mails no response whatsoever.",
        "Wow",
        "Hey, I used to work at Zomato customer support few years back. I can tell you that it depends on your rating there are rating for every customers like gold, silver browns. If you like silver or bronze customer, you will get the same exact exact bot Chat over and over again. All you can do is just email them that‚Äôs it.",
        "How to get good ratings ?",
        "I don't blame them for this though. I could order and drink it and provide them this image that it was spilt. You/Your friend did not provide an appropriate image of the packaging showing it was spilt inside.",
        "You should also post photos of spilled. It gives impression that you drink completely then ask refund",
        "why are these subs turning into customer rant platforms ffs",
        "Even I would not have gave you a refund if you provide me this type of picture\n\nprovide a good picture where it shows that it has spilled... otherwise no one would believe you",
        "Dealt with zomato customer service a lot. Tell them you‚Äôre unsatisfied and have a human talk to/chat with you. They‚Äôre usually better at helping. As a last resort you can also tell em that you‚Äôll be escalating this over social media and Twitter. That usually gets the refund",
        "Be a good customer. Be polite to riders. Don't fret over small issues like 5 mins delay or too many calls to find location. Your delivery executives and customer complaint history determines you ratings, be nice to riders, polite to customer care and make an issue of something when only there is an issue. When I order things like coffee or cake, I call my rider before he picks up the order and tell them \"drive carefully, take your time, I am in no rush, I'll tip you later to make up for lost time\". They mostly listen and appreciate that.",
        "Hmm , one of my friend girl always used to take refund. Maybe her rating got 0 now",
        "Show the delivery bag with the spillage and show the half empty cup. Show the crime scene.\n\nAnyone could enjoy the drink and show a empty cup with a disgusted way of holding the cup",
        "It was your mistake. The spillage should be reported within 5 minutes of your delivery. If there was spillage, the photo should be not of an empty glass, but the photo of the bag in which everything was spilled. There should be other food along with it or else it becomes very difficult for Zomato to get you the compensation. \n\nFood leakage is not a new thing and as far as I have experienced, Zomato does compensate for genuine cases. Once due to a leakage issue, Zomato had once reversed a pizza worth 800 for me. Milkshakes, juices several times and numerous times I had my money for rolls reversed due to leakages. It should be a genuine issue and should look like a genuine issue. Whilst I believe in your story, the evidence was not enough to give you compensation. Had you sent the cup half empty and a photo of its contents spilled all over your food, you would have gotten the full compensation",
        "Depends on how many times you have went for the chat and asked for refund or coupon code. Less refunds and any coupon codes they have given you, you are in gold or silver. If you have went to chat more then 3 to 5 times for refunds, you will be on bronze or iron.",
        "I ordered Dosa and from Zomato and they sent me dosa without sambar or chutney.\n\nContacted them on customer support and they said the restaurant closed and after arguing on the phone call for 20 mins they have me 70rs coupon code.\nHad to eat dosa with water ü´†üòî",
        "Truly does!! Swiggy is even worse. Was back home in Delhi a few weeks ago, and they screwed up my order, it was 1+ hour delayed for a waiting time of 35-40 mins. Contacted their chat service where they gave basic corporate speak. Made me so angry. \n\nWhen it finally came, the Zomato delivery driver was inexcusably rude!!",
        "Is it same in Amazon ? Some people even got refund for MacBook here on reditt but not everyone gets it.",
        "not sure they follow it now,   \nnever in 100s of orders have asked a refund or complained. I didn't get an item in an order, CS straight away refused they can't do anything. Had to contact hotel, got the item though.\n\nAs Zomato's customer was pissed, vowed never to order again from them.   \nBut Swiggy is always costlier than Zomato for me, shamelessly order now and hope it comes correctly",

        "It's not the first time this happened to someone. I think sometime ago I saw a comment from someone claiming to be zomato employee, and he told how people try to get refunds even though there were no faults with orders. In the op case, it's extremely unclear if she drank it and showed an empty cup and asked for a refund or she's genuinely saying the truth. It's hard to believe us Indians. Also it feels stupid to order Hot chocolate for delivery. It would get cold by the time it reaches you, and the probability of spillage is extremely high and 300rs for a hot chocolate, that too from McDonald's??? I can't believe they are charging such ridiculous prices.",
        "Welcome to ‚Äúpost funding boom‚Äù era and thanks for choosing Zomato.\n\nAs a next step and for more aggressive headaches, I would recommend trying Myntra. \n\n\nFor more advanced level, you can also choose Flipkart if you want a significantly more difficult challenge.",
        "Prove that you didn't empty it into your stomach.",
        "Lodu hai Swiggy. Things have changed. The days their payments failed last month and people got multiple deliveries, they did nothing to refund it. Absolutely nothing.",
        "I ordered a chicken sandwich from Subway and the fuckers sent me a sandwich without chicken in it. When I asked for a refund they said they will refund 25 rs for a 350 rs sandwich. I said keep that 25 rs also and switched to swiggy.",
        "I don't know man but it doesn't look spilled to me.",
        "Swiggy is best. They always compensate instantly for late delivery/spillage issues.",
        "Honestly, subscriptions don't elevate your status in the system. It all depends on behaviour and value. High-value refunds are often blocked by the system because of the loss factor. Used to work in a similar system and many times had to tell people about this without really telling them this.",
        "Yeah they should have taken the picture along with packing not just pick empty glass and show it. My experience with Zomato support has been pretty good, they refund within minutes once they get a decent photo as evidence",
        "Tbh I don't see wrong in their response. The photo shows no spillage but just an empty glass.",
        "This. It wasn't Zomato for me, but I regularly order milk from Swiggy Instamart as it takes like what, extra ‚Çπ4 to get it delivered in 12-13 minutes if I buy in bulk.\n\nFew times in succession I got delivered puffed/badly damaged packs and I ask for a refund for those. They always refund 100% of the amount. It went from uploading pictures, to uploading and describing, to uploading, describing and no refunds, to just straight up being ghosted as in the screenshot, asking to drop a mail. I even asked them if it is possible to select what warehouse or whatever the fuck it is called (there are two near me, according to maps) because it looked like the person who packed it was doing it in a way that fucks it up.\n\nI've been nice to all delivery kids. Wishing them if there's a festival, asking if they'd like to have a snack/water, \"Koi baat nahi bhai tu araamse aana koi ghai nai hai\", tipping them if it rains, and I got fucked because of something beyond my control.\n\nMy orders finally started arriving fine and so I stopped complaining, but pretty sure those fucks think \"Haha, he ain't taking the long way of emailing us, which proves the refunds were fake\" or something like that.\n\nAnd don't get me started on Uber Eats.",
        "Too much reliance on e-commerce and ultra \"customer is king\" mindset. Open the page of any e-commerce on social media and every comment is like this, asking for a refund and asking others to never use that platform again.",
        "This shit happens with me everytime and I have a rating of 4.83",
        "Just tap the missing items section and claim a refund !",
        "true I agree, I wanted to highlight I never complained or asked for refund before for around 5 years.   \nWhen the item didn't get delivered, I didn't ask for refund just was asking what they can do for it?   \nCS could only say contact the restaurant, which is a shitty response.",

My usual McDonald‚Äôs order on Swiggy was 638 or something but the exact same thing on the mcd app was under 550. Plus, they have me options to customize my sauce options. I still use Swiggy but not for mcd.",

        "I had a similar incident recently. I ordered from a usual nearby restaurant it takes 30 mins max to deliver to my home. The delivery guy was an hour late. I contacted support and they said the delivery guy is late due to \"personal issues\". I told him okay but I want my food to be hot and fresh and they assured me it will be. When it was delivered as expected it was cold and soggy af. I complained. I explained the situation and they just said sorry please accept the order this time and it won't happen again lol. I mean i should just accept whatever they give me just because they apologized lmfao it was ridiculous.",
        "Zomato is Flipkart of food delivery",
        "I have a rating of 4.6* currently but I have been denied a refund a couple of times, that was mostly when I received completely different food item than what I ordered, maybe they feel we will still have that item, so giving a refund makes them look like a loser, lol\n\nSometimes they don't refund if there is just minor spillage or if they can't verify the authenticity of your issue.",
        "If it was spilled op then whole bag and the items along side must have been affected too that was required as proof",
        "Swiggy is far better at customer service. They have an instant gratification policy. They pay the customer the refund first and then retrieve it from the restaurant instead of getting it from the restaurant and then refunding it.",
        "Yes they do. I ordered delivery and two items were missing. I reported it with the pics that was all the recourse they offered. They didn‚Äôt even refund me for the items",

        "Very common with Indian service providers. They take customers for granted for sure.

Honestly after that I've cut down 90 percent of my ordering from apps. Worse was that the order was for my mom and I felt like shit, I did it on her and mailed them as i was at home at the time but my maa never followed up with it so the refund never happened fully probably",
        "They tend to instantly refund post 12 at night ive noticed. If it were working hours, theyd call the restaurant to double check before",

        "I hated swiggy. They always messed up delivery locations for months after coming out. The delivery guy would often stop at the wrong place - rarely near our actual house, and on the off chance that it was close-by, he would demand that we come to him, or \"we would be blacklisted as customers\" or some shit. This was early off the pandemic, late 2021 and early 2022, so my parents just told me to go get the package. And get this - most of the times that he didn't come close to our house? Yeah he'd be in a completely different location, to the point that it would be just as far (or in one particularly bad case, farther) than just going to the restaurant. Part of this was the arrogance of delivery drivers who had confusingly been brought from another city (why couldn't they just hire people from this city?) and wouldn't learn the paths, and part was that swiggy charged way too much for this experience. A lot of restaurants straight up broke their deals with Swiggy in our city because people started putting the blame on them.\n\nI've  only had one arrogant ass delivery guy with zomato, who sent his 14 year old brother to do the delivery because \"he was smoking\", but generally the delivery personnel have been much better. I had a pizza delivered poorly once and the delivery guy returned me 25% of the money (I was using cash) on the spot becuase he knew he had botched the delivery.",

Doesn't work on bakery goods since their preparation phase is very short to no preparation at all. After comparing the results I found out  that I was saving at least INR 40 to 50 on every order that I made. Sometimes the savings went as high as INR 200.\n\nI stopped ordering food after that.

        "# BEWARE! This could happen to you!\n\nZOMATO HAS BECOME A LIAR AND A THIEF!!! I ordered food from Zomato as a Gold member on April 21, 2024 and then set my phone aside to charge. 45 minutes later, when I checked to see where my order was, I saw a missed call from the delivery partner timed two minutes before. I tried to call back, but the Zomato App informed me that they had cancelled my order as the delivery partner could not contact me and they would be keeping the entire amount I paid for the order as a cancellation charge. Repeated chats with their customer service team proved useless; they told me that they had followed their policy, done nothing wrong and I was not entitled to any refund. I angrily requested to speak to someone in charge and, after a callback from Zomato the next day, was told by a supervisor that even though Zomato was not at fault, they could give me a discretionary INR 500 discount, which was less than half what the food had cost. However, one month later, there is no sign of the INR 500 in my account.BEWARE! This could happen to you!",

The menu options may have changed, so follow the instructions provided.\n\nIn some cases, you may need to press a specific number or stay on the line without selecting any option to connect to a customer care executive. Listen to the available options carefully to find the one that allows you to speak with a representative.\n\nBe prepared to wait on hold as there may be a queue of callers ahead of you. Customer care lines can sometimes be busy, so patience will be necessary.\n\nOnce connected to a customer care executive, clearly explain the reason for your call and provide any necessary details or account information they may ask for. This will help them understand your query or concern better and provide you with the appropriate assistance.\n\nIf you are unable to reach an executive through the 198 helpline or if the process has changed, I recommend visiting Zomato official website or contacting their customer support through their official channels to inquire about the best way to speak with an executive order to get.¬†",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Zomato has the worst customer service",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "So I gifted a hot chocolate to my friend from McDonalds and then he said that the whole hot chocolate has spilled and he received less than even half a glass. I paid nearly Rs300 for this and all Zomato has to say is sorry for the inconvenience. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm paying money to just deal with their customer care and not for food. Horrible experience . I even mailed them But still there was no point. Is there anyway to get back at them ?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "This is what they replied to the mail tbf it looks like an empty cup, where did everything spill? i think they need more evidence of that Trueee, Swiggy is the all time OG! I never had such complaints with Swiggy‚Äôs customer care. They‚Äôre never getting back I guess! Had a similar issue, sent more than 10 mails no response whatsoever. Wow Hey, I used to work at Zomato customer support few years back. I can tell you that it depends on your rating there are rating for every customers like gold, silver browns. If you like silver or bronze customer, you will get the same exact exact bot Chat over and over again. All you can do is just email them that‚Äôs it. How to get good ratings ? I don't blame them for this though. I could order and drink it and provide them this image that it was spilt. You/Your friend did not provide an appropriate image of the packaging showing it was spilt inside. You should also post photos of spilled. It gives impression that you drink completely then ask refund why are these subs turning into customer rant platforms ffs Even I would not have gave you a refund if you provide me this type of picture provide a good picture where it shows that it has spilled... otherwise no one would believe you Dealt with zomato customer service a lot. Tell them you‚Äôre unsatisfied and have a human talk to/chat with you. They‚Äôre usually better at helping. As a last resort you can also tell em that you‚Äôll be escalating this over social media and Twitter. That usually gets the refund Be a good customer. Be polite to riders. Don't fret over small issues like 5 mins delay or too many calls to find location. Your delivery executives and customer complaint history determines you ratings, be nice to riders, polite to customer care and make an issue of something when only there is an issue. When I order things like coffee or cake, I call my rider before he picks up the order and tell them \"drive carefully, take your time, I am in no rush, I'll tip you later to make up for lost time\". They mostly listen and appreciate that. Hmm , one of my friend girl always used to take refund. Maybe her rating got 0 now Show the delivery bag with the spillage and show the half empty cup. Show the crime scene. Anyone could enjoy the drink and show a empty cup with a disgusted way of holding the cup It was your mistake. The spillage should be reported within 5 minutes of your delivery. If there was spillage, the photo should be not of an empty glass, but the photo of the bag in which everything was spilled. There should be other food along with it or else it becomes very difficult for Zomato to get you the compensation. Food leakage is not a new thing and as far as I have experienced, Zomato does compensate for genuine cases. Once due to a leakage issue, Zomato had once reversed a pizza worth 800 for me. Milkshakes, juices several times and numerous times I had my money for rolls reversed due to leakages. It should be a genuine issue and should look like a genuine issue. Whilst I believe in your story, the evidence was not enough to give you compensation. Had you sent the cup half empty and a photo of its contents spilled all over your food, you would have gotten the full compensation Depends on how many times you have went for the chat and asked for refund or coupon code. Less refunds and any coupon codes they have given you, you are in gold or silver. If you have went to chat more then 3 to 5 times for refunds, you will be on bronze or iron. I ordered Dosa and from Zomato and they sent me dosa without sambar or chutney. Contacted them on customer support and they said the restaurant closed and after arguing on the phone call for 20 mins they have me 70rs coupon code. Had to eat dosa with water ü´†üòî Truly does!! Swiggy is even worse. Was back home in Delhi a few weeks ago, and they screwed up my order, it was 1+ hour delayed for a waiting time of 35-40 mins. Contacted their chat service where they gave basic corporate speak. Made me so angry. When it finally came, the Zomato delivery driver was inexcusably rude!! Is it same in Amazon ? Some people even got refund for MacBook here on reditt but not everyone gets it. not sure they follow it now, never in 100s of orders have asked a refund or complained. I didn't get an item in an order, CS straight away refused they can't do anything. Had to contact hotel, got the item though. As Zomato's customer was pissed, vowed never to order again from them. But Swiggy is always costlier than Zomato for me, shamelessly order now and hope it comes correctly It's not the first time this happened to someone. I think sometime ago I saw a comment from someone claiming to be zomato employee, and he told how people try to get refunds even though there were no faults with orders. In the op case, it's extremely unclear if she drank it and showed an empty cup and asked for a refund or she's genuinely saying the truth. It's hard to believe us Indians. Also it feels stupid to order Hot chocolate for delivery. It would get cold by the time it reaches you, and the probability of spillage is extremely high and 300rs for a hot chocolate, that too from McDonald's??? I can't believe they are charging such ridiculous prices. Welcome to ‚Äúpost funding boom‚Äù era and thanks for choosing Zomato. As a next step and for more aggressive headaches, I would recommend trying Myntra. For more advanced level, you can also choose Flipkart if you want a significantly more difficult challenge. Prove that you didn't empty it into your stomach. Lodu hai Swiggy. Things have changed. The days their payments failed last month and people got multiple deliveries, they did nothing to refund it. Absolutely nothing. I ordered a chicken sandwich from Subway and the fuckers sent me a sandwich without chicken in it. When I asked for a refund they said they will refund 25 rs for a 350 rs sandwich. I said keep that 25 rs also and switched to swiggy. I don't know man but it doesn't look spilled to me. Swiggy is best. They always compensate instantly for late delivery/spillage issues. Honestly, subscriptions don't elevate your status in the system. It all depends on behaviour and value. High-value refunds are often blocked by the system because of the loss factor. Used to work in a similar system and many times had to tell people about this without really telling them this. Yeah they should have taken the picture along with packing not just pick empty glass and show it. My experience with Zomato support has been pretty good, they refund within minutes once they get a decent photo as evidence Tbh I don't see wrong in their response. The photo shows no spillage but just an empty glass. This. It wasn't Zomato for me, but I regularly order milk from Swiggy Instamart as it takes like what, extra ‚Çπ4 to get it delivered in 12-13 minutes if I buy in bulk. Few times in succession I got delivered puffed/badly damaged packs and I ask for a refund for those. They always refund 100% of the amount. It went from uploading pictures, to uploading and describing, to uploading, describing and no refunds, to just straight up being ghosted as in the screenshot, asking to drop a mail. I even asked them if it is possible to select what warehouse or whatever the fuck it is called (there are two near me, according to maps) because it looked like the person who packed it was doing it in a way that fucks it up. I've been nice to all delivery kids. Wishing them if there's a festival, asking if they'd like to have a snack/water, \"Koi baat nahi bhai tu araamse aana koi ghai nai hai\", tipping them if it rains, and I got fucked because of something beyond my control. My orders finally started arriving fine and so I stopped complaining, but pretty sure those fucks think \"Haha, he ain't taking the long way of emailing us, which proves the refunds were fake\" or something like that. And don't get me started on Uber Eats. Too much reliance on e-commerce and ultra \"customer is king\" mindset. Open the page of any e-commerce on social media and every comment is like this, asking for a refund and asking others to never use that platform again. This shit happens with me everytime and I have a rating of 4.83 Just tap the missing items section and claim a refund ! true I agree, I wanted to highlight I never complained or asked for refund before for around 5 years. When the item didn't get delivered, I didn't ask for refund just was asking what they can do for it? CS could only say contact the restaurant, which is a shitty response. How can we check our rating Always do COD. Verify the food and accept it or just return it right away. Sachin awasthi ki video yaad aa gyi zomato customer complain wali.. OP please see that reel you will have a good laugh üòù Bahot purana hai wo video. Because technically they are not employees, they are partners. Hence it's difficult to take that kind of action against them haan but OP ne nhi dkhi hogi Wo video k baad Maine swiggy zomato ko complaint karna band Kar diya üíÄ They used to much better, now i've got my order wrong multiple times or had spillage issues and even with evidence all they'll do is apologize. Definitely would start reconsidering using these apps if this becomes a pattern. That picture inspires no confidence wo meri first video thi sachin ki phr maine use follow kr diya üòå Mai to starting se hi dekh rha hu jab uske 3k follower the Tbf, Good customer services like amazon's get taken advantage of by asshats. Tbf, Good customer services like amazon's get taken advantage of by asshats. Just start using words like deficiency in service, deceptive marketting and see how their response changes I'm fairly certain you didn't even talk to any customer support \"executives\". They're all chat bots. Like others have pointed out, you can‚Äôt see a spill. All you see is an empty glass. Any one can send a photo of an empty glass and claim it spilled. User error here. But also, I would recommend ordering McDonalds off their official app. They‚Äôre a lot more swift. My usual McDonald‚Äôs order on Swiggy was 638 or something but the exact same thing on the mcd app was under 550. Plus, they have me options to customize my sauce options. I still use Swiggy but not for mcd. True but multiple complaints?? I mean, come on, at some point that‚Äôs just bad for business. Swiggy & Zomato also have extremely rude riders. It honestly doesn't matter for them. I don't know, but there was a news sometime late last year about a delivery guy stealing someone's shoes. Inspite of having video evidence, nothing major came out of it(atleast publicly). Ya I know it doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs whats most annoying. They just don‚Äôt CARE!! Feels good that my 4.72 rating is not useless. Yeah yesterday I ordered some jalebis they were burnt, instant refund was given Lmfao my rating is 4.28 and 4.15 in both of my accounts üò≠ I agree but these all are pics which I received from my friend and at the moment I really didn‚Äôt know what to do cause I was just upset that I gifted someone a drink and this is how it ended up I have a rating of 4.75 Even I doubt you Now Zomato is shite! I had a similar incident recently. I ordered from a usual nearby restaurant it takes 30 mins max to deliver to my home. The delivery guy was an hour late. I contacted support and they said the delivery guy is late due to \"personal issues\". I told him okay but I want my food to be hot and fresh and they assured me it will be. When it was delivered as expected it was cold and soggy af. I complained. I explained the situation and they just said sorry please accept the order this time and it won't happen again lol. I mean i should just accept whatever they give me just because they apologized lmfao it was ridiculous. Zomato is Flipkart of food delivery I have a rating of 4.6* currently but I have been denied a refund a couple of times, that was mostly when I received completely different food item than what I ordered, maybe they feel we will still have that item, so giving a refund makes them look like a loser, lol Sometimes they don't refund if there is just minor spillage or if they can't verify the authenticity of your issue. If it was spilled op then whole bag and the items along side must have been affected too that was required as proof Swiggy is far better at customer service. They have an instant gratification policy. They pay the customer the refund first and then retrieve it from the restaurant instead of getting it from the restaurant and then refunding it. Yes they do. I ordered delivery and two items were missing. I reported it with the pics that was all the recourse they offered. They didn‚Äôt even refund me for the items Maybe the glass is half full You are dumb to take a photo like that as evidence üòÇ Wait I didn't get my burger I'll post an empty burger wrapper as evidence that I didn't receive the burger . ROFL. Very common with Indian service providers. They take customers for granted for sure. Though I haven't had such an experience with zomato, have faced such issues with Flipkart, Motorola and Swiggy. Here once you have bought something from them, they consider you done! Move to acquire the next customer. To hell with the existing one. Bro over here is scamming zomatoüíÄ, imagine if they find out... Sounds like a costumer issue... its a cup, move tf on The first one was actual and got refunded in seconds. That's why I tried the second time, also done in seconds. Thats great dude ü§ñ Serves you right. Next time order a can of chocolate and a packet of milk for delivery via zomato üòÅ Mix chocolate powder with warm milk in a nice glass. Mix well. Enjoy with entire family. Costs less Than Rs:300/- and no paper cups. ü§£ü§£ü§£üòù. Thank me later. Can see some spillage on the packaging <<<<<Swiggy I have a good rating and usually I only claim refund with strong proofs so I always get them processed but when theres a bulk order and only one or few items are missing they make it hell, one time I got forced to get refund only for one item when I order the item like multiple times and I asked her for almost an hour to transfer me to someone else if you can't handle this because the claim is legitimate and she was forcing me to not escalate this and kept blabbing company policy. Honestly after that I've cut down 90 percent of my ordering from apps. Worse was that the order was for my mom and I felt like shit, I did it on her and mailed them as i was at home at the time but my maa never followed up with it so the refund never happened fully probably They tend to instantly refund post 12 at night ive noticed. If it were working hours, theyd call the restaurant to double check before This didnt happen w me lmao, i got back my 240 rs for the spilled butter chicken I ordered, even though it was much less spillage You are paying ‚Çπ300 for a hot chocolate . You deserve this. Zomato is ridiculous. They turn a blind eye for the kist genuine cases after resolving 1 case per month. Shit app. Shit services. Never become a gold member. Utter waste of money Never talk to them on chat, they never listen to you and hardly solve your problem, ask them to call you and then resolve the problem, this works 99% of the time for me I hated swiggy. They always messed up delivery locations for months after coming out. The delivery guy would often stop at the wrong place - rarely near our actual house, and on the off chance that it was close-by, he would demand that we come to him, or \"we would be blacklisted as customers\" or some shit. This was early off the pandemic, late 2021 and early 2022, so my parents just told me to go get the package. And get this - most of the times that he didn't come close to our house? Yeah he'd be in a completely different location, to the point that it would be just as far (or in one particularly bad case, farther) than just going to the restaurant. Part of this was the arrogance of delivery drivers who had confusingly been brought from another city (why couldn't they just hire people from this city?) and wouldn't learn the paths, and part was that swiggy charged way too much for this experience. A lot of restaurants straight up broke their deals with Swiggy in our city because people started putting the blame on them. I've only had one arrogant ass delivery guy with zomato, who sent his 14 year old brother to do the delivery because \"he was smoking\", but generally the delivery personnel have been much better. I had a pizza delivered poorly once and the delivery guy returned me 25% of the money (I was using cash) on the spot becuase he knew he had botched the delivery. Zomato is ridiculous. They turn a blind eye for the most genuine cases after resolving 1 case per month. Shit app. Shit services. Never become a gold member. Utter waste of money. Zomato has become unbearable Lol due to lot of fake complaints, genuine guys have to suffer. Just provide a screenshot with cup and packaging showing spillage. They would proceed with refund. More like 300 for a no longer hot chocolate. Keep the 25 Rs also üòÇ You're savage, lol. What was their reaction after this? Idk why you are being downvoted but I would also be mad if I get a drink half spilt. And there seems to be enough evidence that the drink was spilt cos no package would look like that with just condensation. Ghar par pakao. Khao. Swiggy Zomato ke chakkar me na pado. Ya khud restaurant Jaa kar le aao. I've realised that if I went to a restaurant that is 5 kms away I can reach the restaurant, order, get my food then get home before swiggy or Zomato can deliver my food on multiple occasions. Doesn't work on bakery goods since their preparation phase is very short to no preparation at all. After comparing the results I found out that I was saving at least INR 40 to 50 on every order that I made. Sometimes the savings went as high as INR 200. I stopped ordering food after that. It's been a year and a half now. They indeed have worst customer service. Pizza hut cancelled the order and didn't even give the whole refund. Zomato kept his side of the amount. When I tried contacting them, it went nowhere. Why shouldn't I get entire refund when I didn't cancel the order? Bhoomi just made a Cameo üíÄ Showed this to one of my friends She said it's a wrong thing to do. I don't think stealing from a billion dollar corporation is that bad ü´° You have to wait for 72 hrs after completing the first 72 hrs and so on. Can't you understand a simple thing sir? This is a company policy. In the app menu Flipkart was a pain. They sent me defective earphones and it was a nightmare trying to get a replacement. Exactly. You can make at least 10 hot chocolates at home for 300 Once, I found a small stone in my biryani, I removed it and kept it just beside the biryani, I complained to Swiggy, and executive said that stone is beside the biryani and not inside it so we cannot provide you refund!! I always get refunded by chat bots. I once sent zomato customer support a pic of hair inside food, they fully refunded the amount and even gave some extra coupons within 2 hours. Adidas on the other hand are yet to to refund me 2500 Rs Oh, rating customers as ‚Äúbrowns‚Äù sounds a tad racist? ;-) yes, 1 time there was 1 of the items was missing. upon contacting them, they connected with the restaurant and said that the restaurant informed them that no item was missed. so they could not do anything. sorry it is bronze I second that! So do you get refund coupons if your delivery is delayed? I've had a Gold membership for a while and I remember it used to be a thing and I only claimed it like a couple of times but now my orders get delayed half the time lately but don't receive any of the coupons. My rating is 4.4. If I was the customer support, I wouldn‚Äôt help you either. That doesn‚Äôt looked spilled at all, it just looks completely empty. You should‚Äôve taken photo when you received it to show how you received it. This is completely your fault. Why not go with your friend to McDonalds and the whole hot chocolate with him? He is in another city? Think how much effort needs to be taken to prevent spillage for Rs. 300 item. i have ordered from wendys at night and some of the packaging was missing and they advertised glazed buns, that was also missing so when i talked to customer service they instantly refunded in their own wallet, i had ordered like 600rs worth of burgers iirc I hate zomato for this. Happened with me 5-6 times. I have switched to swiggy. It‚Äôs just swiggy has less restaurants. But man zomato is shit, It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, they don‚Äôt give a shit. I once had wrong item delivered and didn‚Äôt get refund. Plus the delivery guys if zomato are mostly crooks. I wish some boycott trends starts and zomato gets shitted so bad even worse than what happened to snapdeal. His scamming that why getting downvoted. Typical scammer Zomato is shit. I hate it from bottom of my heart. You don‚Äôt know how hunger can drive you crazy and zomato makes you crazier. Bunch of crooks at zomato. Yea. They changes the policy long ago. The thing is people started to misuse the privilege of getting refund on spilled , wrong order etc and now they did this . Not only ZOMATO even Swiggy . Who the heck buys only a hot chocolate ü§°ü§° Personally I always have a very smooth experience with Zomato. Bro you should have sent the pic of the spillage also not only of the empty glass. Empty glass pic looks like you have gobbled the drink yourself. You should have sent a complete pic of the glass with all the spillage. Zomato doesnt take time to refund your money or issue u a coupon if the evidence (pic) is perfect. Ya. I had similar experiences with Zomato back in the day. So, permanently moved to Swiggy as my default food ordering app. Customer experience has been good. It‚Äôs pathetic, and Zomato gold is useless. They have stopped giving o time delivery guarantee - my order was 35 min late (so effectively it took 45+35=1 hour 20 min for the order to deliver) and they did nothing despite gold membership. I‚Äôve also seen that if I book a table using zomato gold, the restaurant treats very differently. The most pathetic table is allowed even if the restaurant is empty. Service is bad too. I even have zomato gold and order almost everyday, once in maybe 7-10 days I have to report the issue and they do not refund. I work night shifts and i get hungry around 2-3 in the morning. But oh God the customer service drives me crazy You sneaky bastard you ate it and if you want a refund or return, just think about the delivery guy I once received a completely wrong order from Zomato. After raising a complaint, all the executive assistant could tell was that he was sorry for the inconvenience and there's nothing they could do because the outlet wasn't picking his calls. No refund, no nothing.l These pics don't really prove the scenario, if the cup spilled the whole cup on the outside would have chocolate marks, and there must be the plastic where it all spilled, why didn't you click the pic of that? These pics will not help. I have good experience with zomato customer service. They always either give refund or add credits to account. Maybe it‚Äôs because I have good rating like the other dude said in comments. I used to order alot from MCD and always got the extra value meal or smth. NEVER take the open drinks it will always be spilled because common sense, always buy a can which they provide. Its not zomato‚Äôs fault completely MCD has shit packing and too expensive for bs. Report it to MCD not zomato. Lol seems like I'm a good customer cause my issues are always resolved That's why swigggy is superior If you have gold and if you're orders are delayed you should have the claim coupon button in the maps page itself I think, you don't have to reach out to support directly And this is not good. They literally say on rating page that one of the factor is tipping the delivery guy. If they hand over our rating to delivery guy then how can the trust happen. A customer should be the one giving rating. If any issue arises from delivery guy, why can't he call to customer and and let Zomato decide the rating. Wait till you need zepto support. Atleast someone from zomato responded In these kinds of things, just put not received. Better response. I never had the problem at all. When i received a partial wrong order, they gave me a full refund. I was a Zomato gold user.. After few incidents I stopped using Zomato. Yep, swiggy delivery is not good. They show 40 minutes for delivery and it will still show 40 minutes for delivery after half hour. And then I see the delivery guy take a longer route and deays again. I prefer zomato if I have no time to wait like super hungry. Atleast they deliver on time or is more accountable than swiggy. You're probably blacklisted for taking too many refunds by doing shady stuff. That's why they're not giving you anything. I‚Äôve never asked for a refund this is my first Gali gali me shor hai Zomato wale ch.. hain. The entitlement here. How do you know it spilled from that picture? Also, do you expect a hot chocolate to remain hot after 60 minutes of January weather? Have realistic expectations and you will find that these food delivery apps and especially the workers are doing a great job of keeping us fed. Swiggy recently pissed me off. I ordered for bread - 450g bread on Saturday and they gave me bread which expires on sunday. I raised complaint asking for replacement. They were ready to refund but now replace. I kept tellin them it's for 1 person, so replacement will be better, so I don't have to waste the food, but they weren't ready for replacement. Then no clue bro. My friend was working in Zomato, he told me this. I wouldn‚Äôt scam for a mere 300 rs . I just wanted to raise an issue that I faced Opt for cod.. their balls will be in ur court Bro I‚Äôm from Kerala , what weather are you talking about ? Its always hot here Edit : I have recieved a refund for the hot chocolate after talking to a customer representative. 300 is not really a small amount either. It's a valid concern OP.. Don't have to feel bad to raise such concerns. Yeah no you drank it fo sho my bro 16 year old teen with parents money. Now bro gonna post on legal advice Abey Kerala has such nice food. Why order from some McD? Could have gone for that nadan kozhi with parotta, unbeatable in any weather. Like I mentioned it was for a friend who wanted hot chocolate hence It's pathetic. I've faced too many issues. Their staff is rude and unhelpful. Stopped using it entirely after they refused to refund my money when I only got 1 item out of 8 that I had ordered. The staff told me there's nothing they can do and denied any refund UberEats used to refund money, that‚Äôs such a good food appüî• I hate these bots. Feel so helpless. Can't even talk to a person and explain the issue. Again a win for corporate and customer can f**k off. Order direct Hate to admit it...but...this is the reason I am getting richer quarter by quarter... they figured they're a duopoly so they're doing whatever the fuck the want How much did you originally order, a teaspoon? I wasn't aware zomato had sales representative bots on reddit lol...whats with the downvotesü§£ I know where it is, you can also access it by opening the order summary. But it doesn't give me that option anymore. I agree something similar happened with me I order a meal from burger king with a whopper fries and coke.. Biggest mistake I made the coke was leaking. Half the bag was soked in coke the entire burger, fries and half spilled coke. When I complained all the bot said was we're sorry but this isn't our fault but restaurants fault we can't do anything for u U guys are ordering still online!? üòÇ Stupid ppl. Delete account live peacefullyüòä never buy any drinks from mcdonalds on the takeaway. stupid paper cups are not even capable of handling the milk. my experience with customer service has been better since i bought gold Dude you fucking drank the whole thing But they instantly provided me the whole refund in my case , no questions asked as well Stop blaming him for not sending the spillage photos properly. I had the exact same issue and I did send the photos including the spillage all over the carrier bag yet the stupid chat spat out the same reply. bhai papa mummy ko ek jagah ke chilli potato pasand hain to kal humne wohi mangaye. usne saale ne namak hi ni dala aur mene complaint raise ki toh saale kehte ki next time se ni hoga aur koi support se baat nhi, koi refund ni. ulta bolte email krdo. email pe kehte ye resolve nhi ho sakta. mai gold user hu. ab kabhi paisa waste ni krunga is ghatiya app pe. OP fraud kar raha hain Click pics immediately on receiving and send it to them. I have got refunds more often than not for genuine cases. deliver cold food Tweet about this Zomato is a joke Even i cannot find it now. Earlier it would appear on the order tracking screen as well that the refund would be issued after order is delivered. Zomato doesn't usually refund money but they give discount coupons for your next order. I agree. Once they sent over spoilt chicken wings from Pizza Hut and I raised the objection saying spoilt food delivered. The response ? Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll let the restaurant know. Motherf*** didn't even refund the amount. I paid for something that I had to throw away! Never trust these delivery aggregators. Bloody loots. Dosa with water, Brother that's some sad shit. Yeah I had the same issue. I used to order from the same place for breakfast every Sunday for almost 6 months and this delivery partner decided to drop the package and spill the entire curry one day. I got my delivery super late, like an hour late and the whole thing spilled all over my apartment and dining table. I showed them video of the whole thing and still they said they‚Äôll be careful next time. And I said good bye to Zomato forever. I‚Äôm quite happy with Swiggy for now. So true, also like hot chocolate is so easy to make. I reported my issue immediately. Like within one minute with video and multiple pictures. And I have a good rating. Still they refused. The plastic can was pretty beat up, dirt on the packaging. Clearly the delivery man dropped it. The spillage was all over the place. In the lobby, in the lift. ü§¶. Still no refund and they were pretty rude about the whole thing. I just deleted the app. They likely transfer the costs over to the restaurant Here‚Äôs the thing OP. Shit happens and drinks spill. Even if I suppose that what you‚Äôre saying is true, stop choking up all the social platforms with these reviews. Drink spilled, you didn‚Äôt get a refund, game over. If 300 Rs doesn‚Äôt matter to you, why are you ranting about it everywhere. These reviews won‚Äôt even pose a cent of loss for them. Stop wasting time and chill up. Nothing happens. Same with swiggy From the pic it looks like ur friend drank it lol Hello I've brought your indian street food that some dirty indian mixed with his hand.. make sure and shit in the street when you're done I got food poisoning. I ordered this chicken 65 from a restaurant last month (December) and felt like having it again, i ordered it on 14th January. Got severe food poisoning because of it, when i raised a complaint, all i got was a ‚Çπ98 couponü§° OMG SAME HAPPENED AND I WROTE AN EMAIL AS WELL SAME SHITTY RESPONSE I can understand your situation ,From my similar experience. They will for sure get back to you on mail. Most probably they will provide you the coupon of same amount to be ordered from same restro. Atleast this is what happened with me. Zomato has lost it completely. They don't have the ops to support their offerings. And now they have even gone full AI mode, making the experience even worse when things go wrong. Is it just me, or does it take a special type of idiot who orders prepared beverages online and expect to get them as they'd in a restaurant? like does it really make sense to order Chai, Coffee, Hot Chocolate, Shakes online? Have you seen the condition of our roads and how traffic moves? What's the delivery personnels fault if liquid spills over? How would the customer know about the location of the spillage? The benefit of doubt in such cases should always go in favour of the customer (in light of the exorbitantly bloated prices that Zomato charges). Itna to packet pe haath saaf karunga to gila ho jaayega.. a hot chocolate half spilt on the burger packet would be way more soggy than this Zomato is the worst. One time I ordered food worth 1600 and rotis weren't delivered. When I complained they said no the restaurant has said they have given we can't do anything. The customer executive female was so rude and just implied that I was lying.Imagine at 11 clock I had to make 20 rotis as we were so hungry that we couldn't order rotis from some other place. When I talked to the person at Zomato they just straight away denied my claims. For mere 200 rs why would I have lied? Then for just rs 200 I took it on my egoü§£ü§£ complained on Twitter and Instagram and within 3 days the social media support of Zomato called me and refunded it. It was not a matter of 200 but just that they feel we are fools and will just give up . Agreed, they've always refunded money anytime I reported an issue If there's spillage, there'd be more than an empty cup. Like in the packaging Many such similar experiences they dont are about customization or request. Even when i paid extra for wheat bun they sent maida one and refused to even acknowledge the problem. The restaurant couldn't deliver the order coz they couldn't find a rider late at night and the zomato guy kept insisting that delivery was attempted but i refused , the restaurant was super nice though they delivered the next day. As i order more and more my rating could do down so only step is to stop usinh zomato for six months right? Cant with sodexo I can tell you from experience, most of the time the people behind the customer support chat on the Zomato app, do this by using the excuse that the picture/video isn't clear. I remember once I had to threaten the person that I was recording the entire chat for the public to see, which is when she escalated my case and my issue was resolved. I have my guesses on why they do that, but what I would like you to do is to immediately fire an email to order@zomato.com without any hesitation, clearly stating your order id along with the issue you've faced and the proof and they'll respond and/or take action. That cup rather drunk than spilled ü§®ü§® swiggy is better, restaurant sent me a different order (which was actually more expensive tbh), they refunded me, let me keep the order AND then delivered my og order Use Twitter. Complaint redressal will be much faster that way. Zomato service is really the worst Use your brain. You sent them a picture of an empty cup Anyone can drink all of it then send the same pictures as you If you wanted to make a case for spilling, maybe include the bag in which it spilled Had similar experience with Zomato at various complaints. They are simply rejecting on further investigation on complaints Always call them ++ BE RESPECTFUL!!! Works best. My criticism is who **orders** (instead of making at home) hot chocolate for delivery 300 Rs and then complains that it spilled ??? It's a liquid. It sloshed. Unreal. Fucking hell. Just make it at home or at your friends home for a fraction of the price, you nit. Make chocolate shake at home for 50 rupees and save 250 and your health. Hot chocolate looks full in this pic. How is this any proof? I did same but they do nothing I think they need an evidence that you didn't emptied on your stomach. This seems at the level of customer service groww has been providing me. Serves you right for supporting a garbage company like McDonalds i mean they aint wrong tho, it looks like a used empty glass. shouldve taken a picture before finishing the drink I agree. Swiggy wale bhi saale same he tbh don‚Äôt order hot chocolate online More foolish behaviour on your behalf lmao. Even I wouldn't believe this post if you don't post the pic as immediately as you receive the packet. Let me tell you how it's done. Many months back I ordered Biryani from Behrouz w/ 150ml coke and the order came without the latter. I talked to the chat assistant providing the pic of the box with items closed to make sure I ain't lying. They refunded me the money. Man ,I have had the similar experience as well. One of the items was missing from the delivery and I tried contacting cs but it‚Äôs always responded by stupid bot. Then I mailed them but they straight away send a generic response with no resolution. This is the mail they send me every time ‚Äú, Hope you are doing well. This email is regarding Order ID -549\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* from KFC Restaurant. We understand the hassle you had to face as you have received an incomplete order. We are dedicated to swiftly resolving this issue and assuring your satisfaction. We tried calling you but you were unresponsive. We understand the importance of your satisfaction. Unfortunately, we are not able to connect with the restaurant at this moment to validate your claim and without validation from the restaurant, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to process a refund. Rest assured that we constantly work towards providing you with a good experience. Best regards, Team Zomato‚Äù At this stage I have given up on the refund because their Support is PATHETIC Yea their customer care is dogshit. Had a terrible experience dealing with them in Dubai. Spilled into the stomach. \"But unfortunately in reality the scenario is not achievable for even the big players in the market. Like *Talabat, Zomato and Delivery Hero* are unable to earn profit in reality.\" Unfortunately, the food delivery business model doesn't work in India as well as in other countries. Hence, they try to automate everything and don't pay their delivery agents, their customer care workers, their other employees, just so that the investors can make the majority of the profits... &#x200B; Here's a supporting article: [why do food delivery businesses fail](https://www.octalsoftware.com/blog/why-do-food-delivery-businesses-fail) It used to be very good. I remember they always compensated me when there was an issue. But the last time I had an issue, where wrong items were delivered then were not co-operative at all. You don't complain after eating your shit Maybe the delivery boy drank it Yea , in recent months i cannot speak to any humans. It is just chat bots with different names. I guess they laid off people mujhe toh hamesha refund mil jaata hai bhai mene bhot missuse kra hai, mere vjah se band kra inhone refund dena huehue This happened to me last time, but then in my case i got my refund and also got a coupon for the inconvenience like some 150/- off Try showing the packaging? That's looks like you could be trying a scam so a bit understdable. Hard Luck, but you have to understand Zomato gets such refund requests all the time(most of the time it's fake) and the photo is not at all convincing, agar spill hogaya tha to pata chal jata pehle hi, record kar Lena chaiye tha. It's on you. can't you just go get the stuff from the place itself, lazyass üòπ You are not stealing from a billion dollar company in this case. You're stealing from the person who actually needed a refund. Yede you should have gone outside to eat foe this kind of beverage. Just uninstall zomato. You should show photo with packaging but why you want order from app that have low quality of service. i have ordered from zomato, 2 bottle of pepsi was missing. How can i prove in photo? Ofcourse, they don't refund me, they said you can rate resturant low for their service. Sometimes it's not laziness. I stay in hostel & I don't have bike in hostel. Going through rickshaw, cost more money & time but it gives satisfaction to go outside to eat food. During exam time, no option left. 300 mai toh meri 3 veg thali aa jati full on punjab se...120 discount laga ke It should have been spilled in the package not inside your mouth. More like lukewarm Bournvita Zomato has always refunded me as soon as I faced issues - sorry you had to face this. Mf you drank half of it and then realized it's not worth money and now you want refund lmfao The place where I live in Mumbai zomata has the best service. I have never experienced such sort of things from then or anyone in your city has. Naughty boy wants Zomato credits üòÇüòÇ And thats your evidence of spillage?an empty cup?? Man you gotta be kidding. You are the problem not Zomato. Nice trick for free food So just out back inside biryani and claim refund üòú Same happened with me on Swiggy - Instamart sent me an expired box of sweets. When I complained I got a similar response saying they can't validate my claim and can't process a refund. I hadn't even asked for a refund, just a replacement. They even took 6 hours to respond. Guess they are cost cutting in the customer service department. swiggy>>>> @op swiggy is also same...just slightly better than zomato..i am going to try foodcourt app for mcd, domino etc franchised items. Good luck to us. You probably got a history of asking for refunds/returns (no offence) I only got a Paneer sabji instead of a Paneer dosa and they straight up refunded the entire amount + an additional 50 Rs to me without asking for pics. Yeah once I ordered something from zomato, the guy from the restaurant delivered it and then took cash payment. Then on the app he marked it as customer not found, so zomato put the charge of the order against me which was added to the bill next time I ordered. Stopped using zomato after that. Zomato has a great refund policy. Please take a picture with half filled glass instead you are taking a picture of an empty glass. Imagine you are the owner of zomato and then check the picture you've shared as evidence of spilled chocolate üòÇ Much worse, an item I had ordered was missing. They wanted a photo or video that it was missing. I placed a plain A4 sheet, took a picture and uploaded. To file a complaint zomato you can follow these steps: 1.

ZOMATO HAS BECOME A LIAR AND A THIEF!!! I ordered food from Zomato as a Gold member on April 21, 2024 and then set my phone aside to charge. 45 minutes later, when I checked to see where my order was, I saw a missed call from the delivery partner timed two minutes before. I tried to call back, but the Zomato App informed me that they had cancelled my order as the delivery partner could not contact me and they would be keeping the entire amount I paid for the order as a cancellation charge. Repeated chats with their customer service team proved useless; they told me that they had followed their policy, done nothing wrong and I was not entitled to any refund. I angrily requested to speak to someone in charge and, after a callback from Zomato the next day, was told by a supervisor that even though Zomato was not at fault, they could give me a discretionary INR 500 discount, which was less than half what the food had cost. However, one month later, there is no sign of the INR 500 in my account.BEWARE! This could happen to you! I agree. Look how they steal customers' money.

To talk to an Zomoto executive helpline, you can try the following steps: Dial 0798-0595-213 from your Zomato mobile phone. This is the customer care helpline number for zomato in India. Listen to the automated voice prompts carefully. The menu options may have changed, so follow the instructions provided. In some cases, you may need to press a specific number or stay on the line without selecting any option to connect to a customer care executive. Listen to the available options carefully to find the one that allows you to speak with a representative. Be prepared to wait on hold as there may be a queue of callers ahead of you. Customer care lines can sometimes be busy, so patience will be necessary. Once connected to a customer care executive, clearly explain the reason for your call and provide any necessary details or account information they may ask for. This will help them understand your query or concern better and provide you with the appropriate assistance. If you are unable to reach an executive through the 198 helpline or if the process has changed, I recommend visiting Zomato official website or contacting their customer support through their official channels to inquire about the best way to speak with an executive order to get.
