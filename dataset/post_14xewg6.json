        "Smaller state ideas are generally from the concept that they can give importance to it and economic development comes and healthy competition is maintained. But yours is not such a great economy, that by splitting it will do any advantage. It will only increase burden on economy as new administration and development of capitals will be in demand. My opinion is small, non performing states which fail miserably in developing of their state should be united, under some separation of powers.",
        "Logically smaller states make sense for better administration, especially for a country as populous as ours \n\nHowever, the motivation for drawing lines in India is rather dangerous. Iâ€™m not a fan",
        "depends on how they divide it. if they give them the land that they already own, what was the fight even for then? lol. if they don't give them the land they own and only partial land, it might lead to more bloodshed. there needs to be peaceful talks but since this is allegedly state sponsored, it won't happen else it would have already happened.",
        "From what I understand, manipur will be pretty hard to divide in smaller state? Do they split the valley? Or some other boundary?",
        "Interpreting the logic of separation of Manipur agianst UP is wrong because if UP were to be separated it wil be for administrative purpose meanwhile the demand for separation in Manipur is to prevent the annihilation of the Kukis by the Meiteis who are aggressively pursuing their genocidal cause by any means. If Telangana and AP can become 2 separate states why would it be any more difficult for Manipur. And its not like other states were clamoring for fragmentation even then. Even if Manipur gets separated grants and funds from the central government will still be dictated by the population, area, income parity etc. Sure it will require more funding to help stabilise the economy after intense and devastating civil unrest but should that stop the central government? There will never be peace in Manipur at this rate and the only way to mitigate the damage that has been already done is separation. Kukis and meiteis can never live together again.",
