        "I see people taking offence that english is not his first language and which is fair but also its his party who want everyone in india to speak Hindi and impose their language so fuck him",

        "Fault? As a citizen of India, my expectation of highest elected body would not budge unless he/she has skills that can override the ability to address in English.\n\nThis is not obsession about English because it seems like looking into past PM's of country i.e. Nehru, Indira, Vajpai, P.V.Narasimharao..kind of people, it is obvious that they are well read people. Being well read, I mean to say that someone who has read enough that they have clear understanding of history and law and hence have the finest reasoning skills to address questions and challenges posed at them. Such people will not resort to cheap tricks to cover up their shortcomings..\n\nTo this day, I have not seen any diplomat who do not speak in English(in India) with the kind of expectations I have.\n\nDidn't our past PMs speak in regional languages too? Modi, clearly is not a well read person , just a street thug. That is the reason why he will not have progressive thoughts.\n\nIf you think these are all not linked to education...then fine. Whom am i to argue against it?\n\nBtw, I would like to see a PM who doesn't speak in Hindi and English.\n\nThe hatred against English here is really laughable....esp, when we are all communicating in that.\n\nI think I have stated my views here very clearly. I am no more giving reasons here. Go ahead  and keep electing those who barely finished high school but are good at Yoga and dressing.",
        "But Atal was actually a better English speaker, he just choose to Speak in Hindi at UN. UN is different where most people speak in Mother tounge and then they always have a interpreter. UN is where people come from many type of languages. Can't compare UN with US.",

        "You really wrote an essay just to say that you don't have problem with him not speaking english but him not being a good pm.\n\nThe problem is the person you tried to argue with was never making the point you are trying to argue against.

Because in most countries , diplomats of high caliber attend greatest universities and are required to know well.",
        "English is definitely no scale to judge a great speaker. And there is no doubt that Modi has greater oratory skills. The issue here is that he could've easily spoken Hindi and used an interpreter. But he chose to speak English for better PR and that is why it's important to criticize in this instance.",
        "I'm only commenting on the \"great speaker\" part. You should be able to have a good command over the language that you wish to express your ideas in if you want to be considered as a great speaker (amongst other qualities) . Not commenting on the person or his IQ here.",
        ">Sorry, your comprehension skills are very low\n\nThis statement is so ironic i am actually laughing right now. You articulated your comment so poorly that you needed to edit your own comment and change the entire narrative so that anybody who reads the \"edited\" comment seem like my reply is not making sense.\n\nSorry man i can't really argue further with a guy who uses pathetic things like editing the comment to make the replying person look dumb",

I understand where they are coming from.\n\nFor any other common person, I would've stood with those comments in their OP's critique. But this is our country's PM. And English is a key language for global communication. I think wishing for some command of such an important language is not too much to expect from the most important person of this country who seems to be doing everything everywhere all at once (judging by everyone attributing all success to Modi).",

        "He is reading off a teleprompter.",

        "What's your point? If you followed before the trip, the Indian diaspora didn't want to take that single question also. So the US did force him to take that question. I know that it was a single question but it wasn't for his PR. It was for Bidens in his country. \n\nI know this is a joke. The person I replied to said cant compare UN to US. I was saying for that matter. He could have surely asked for the adress to be in Hindi. He was forced to take questions.\n\nEdit: If you guys are getting angry that I said questions instead of question. Grow up. I use predictive text keyboard. Dont type it all out.",

It‚Äôs not his first language. This is just nitpicking for the sake of it. I am kinda curious, is it mandatory to speak in English there? Can they not talk in their mother tongue? TBH, he is not the strongest in Engliah and did a commendable job giving this speech. The audience was in rapt attention and these minor snafus don't diminish the importance of the moment. Lips up the en taar phamily Narendra ramlingum I don't like Modi but I don't think it is fair to make fun of him for his english when there are a million actual things to criticise him for. Mansi soni LMAO Little little English coming G Kahan hai teleprompter idhar? I would say \"such hi to hai\" . You got me in the 2/3 part of the comment Don‚Äôt keep so much hate inside you my friend, it will rot you from inside out. English is not his first language and still he is speaking in English. You can criticise him as much as you want, because of his policies and political decisions. They can. But it's good pr in India if Modi ji speaks in English. They can show it on the TV that look how smart he is. Reminds me of when he said \"Beti Bachao, Beti Patao\" Shut the fuck up. What an embarrassment of a prime minister. Wow. I mean not supporting him or opposing his party is completely ok because it‚Äôs a democracy but come on. A slip with one word when talking in a foreign language? And that too standing on such a podium? We need to stop confusing fluency in English with intelligence. He makes a mistake in his non native language. It's fine. People do make mistakes while speaking. Isn't English his second language ? That is fair, however he is constantly propped up by lies of him being a \"charismatic leader\", \"great speaker\" etc so it is important to point these out It's actually stupid and dumb to nitpick on this, English is not his first language, many non-english speaking leaders slip like this, just listen to Macron for once lol. Yeah right as if every non native leader speaks proper English, tf is wrong with you people? Talks about girl child, 0 comment made on wrestler protests where girl child was asking for justice. No comment made on hathras case. Always reads some random inspirational and motivational shit. People hate now for the sake of hating. Well, even investigating sounds correct doesn't it üòâüòè Not after that blunder tho. I'd say the opposite. We were taught and were genuinely impressed when Atal Bihari Vajpayee addressed the UN in Hindi. That's more of a punch. Our leader went to the US and addressed their Congress in Hindi. This is more memorable and historical. The reason people don't care about the above point is due to the fact that IT Cell of BJP for years have been character assassinating RG calling him \"pappu\". Suddenly the tables have turned and they have the audacity to act surprised and call it slip of tongue...... I mean we are already are a big enough country now. So we shouldn't give that much fucks. For everyone who says that we should not criticize him for the mistake in teleprompter...Can you please explain what investigating in a girl child means ?? Isn't he a graduate ?? Doesn't he know basic English ?? He may have completed his graduation in political science with Hindi as a medium right ?? English is not his first language, and humans make silly mistakes all the time. HOWEVER, his party and the media have been constantly mocking his political opponents for the same all these years. More like third language. Sorry, disagree with you strongly. We have certain educational requirements for every profession and why shouldn't we have that for our politicians? The entire nation melted over the fact that he was chai wala and not much educated. Lol. Btw, I find it shameful that we have to go to some Western country to tell how feel about investing in girl child...in this day!! Biden can't even speak his 1st language and you are criticising for his third language. Many graduates makes mistakes. Hindi is not an International language and so it okay for Biden not to speak in our regional language. I think we should make English as our first language because most of us South Indians are better at English than Hindi. Phir Tweet kyu Angrezi m karte hai??? I wouldn't criticize him for his accent, but \"words do matter \" Guys chill, even the BJP IT cell does not spare Rahul Gandhi's slips of tongue. I am fine even if he speaks in any other language. As I mentioned, when he comes to India, and speaks in *any language* other than English perfectly. Exactly, most leaders speak their own mother tongue. That's what the interpreters are for. Diplomats and politicians Take pride in their country's language (s) especially when abroad. Well if we can nitpick the oratory skills of other Indian politicians (e.g. raga) for decades then why not him? He is after all the top representative of India, he's expected to deliver a flawless speech ü§≠ The US is majorly a english speaking country. India is multilingual and well, knowing english should be very important for an Indian responsible for ruling the country. So my braincells died reading your comment Give him a break! English is like his third or forth language. These Americans call rugby football for fuck's sake! bhai wo investing to investigating bol rha hai, poora matlab change ho rha hai sentence ka. I agree, but Biden didn't make fun of Modi. So, your comment is irrelevant . However, all of our education is in English , esp Law (considering he is a politician). So, it all shows how uneducated Modi is to not to know the difference between \"Investigate\" and \"invest\" and no wonder he don't hold press meetings. Probably , he will not understand most of the questions and has no reasonable logic or reasoning capabilities to handle it with grace. Making fun of someone not speaking a foreign language well is stupid and elitist, OP. Bold of you to assume you had any. You haven't seen Biden speak lmao Vishwaguru just proved to the world that India is full of uneducated people. This is why we need an educated PM like MMS. Absolutely, this is why we have foreign affairs ministers who can speak English fluently. But, Gobijee wants all the limelight for himself. So stop confusing intelligence with propoganda. Hindi me bhi to 'beti bachao beti patao' aata hai zubaan pe. Freudian slips hain re baba! Brij Bhushan case me bhi to ulta female wrestlers ko hi investigate kar daala. Why should speaking ~~good~~ basic English in particular be a requirement for politicians? What purpose does it serve for say a MLA from rural Bihar or Orissa, where barely 5% of his constituents would understand English? Not defending Modi here, but people like you who are so out of touch from the ground reality of our country should read more and give less unsolicited opinions about politics. I am sorry but why is english the scale to judge for being a \"charismatic leader\" or a \"great speaker\"? It's okay. Let's not be critical of everything. There are a lot of genuine issues to criticise him for and these petty things will only dilute them. When he gave his address with Pres. Biden, he spoke in Hindi and used an interpreter, including for questions and answers. I think as others said, world leaders tend to address the US Congress in English if they can, for optics, but they could use an interpreter. Good is different from basic. Which foreign minister is invited to speak in another country‚Äôs parliament? If US invites Indian leader to address Congress and we send the FM instead of either PM or President then it would be a grave diplomatic faux pass. Updated the comment. You still didn't answer the question. >However, all of our education is in English Here, right here is the fault with your argument. You are assuming the education system and social construct of obsession towards english is a good thing, which it is not. That is why everyone is saying that nkt knowing english is not a big deal just because our system tells us to do so He never was the \"big shit\" he was made out to be, dumb Indians are just slowly realizing it. Dude he can't even read properly. Is that too much to expect? I wasn't aware of your expectation, I thought we were talking about speaking in english? Did ya just say Freud? Oh yeah Real men don't investigate a minor girlüóø When I criticize him. It‚Äôs holistic not specifically for his English but the million things he‚Äôs done. How can you be a great speaker if you cannot express your ideas properly? What else to expect from a primary school dropper? Hey I am not saying he is one, I am just saying english should not be the scale to judge intelligence, charismatic leader or anything at all, it's not his first language, the dude can have a room temperature IQ but I am not gonna come to that conclusion just after hearing him/her/them/they speak in their second language yeah? I see people taking offence that english is not his first language and which is fair but also its his party who want everyone in india to speak Hindi and impose their language so fuck him why would he speak in any other language than English anyone can mispronounce a word , i wouldn't blame or criticise him for these petty issues , and its not fair either for someone whose mother tongue is not English. This is like when a correct word is replaced with another correct word, and even autocorrect fails to detect it. She is in the US I heard/read. BTW. It helps so that people in poor states can't understand what he is talking about. Otherwise people would ask about women wrestlers. Fault? As a citizen of India, my expectation of highest elected body would not budge unless he/she has skills that can override the ability to address in English. This is not obsession about English because it seems like looking into past PM's of country i.e. Nehru, Indira, Vajpai, P.V.Narasimharao..kind of people, it is obvious that they are well read people. Being well read, I mean to say that someone who has read enough that they have clear understanding of history and law and hence have the finest reasoning skills to address questions and challenges posed at them. Such people will not resort to cheap tricks to cover up their shortcomings.. To this day, I have not seen any diplomat who do not speak in English(in India) with the kind of expectations I have. Didn't our past PMs speak in regional languages too? Modi, clearly is not a well read person , just a street thug. That is the reason why he will not have progressive thoughts. If you think these are all not linked to education...then fine. Whom am i to argue against it? Btw, I would like to see a PM who doesn't speak in Hindi and English. The hatred against English here is really laughable....esp, when we are all communicating in that. I think I have stated my views here very clearly. I am no more giving reasons here. Go ahead and keep electing those who barely finished high school but are good at Yoga and dressing. But Atal was actually a better English speaker, he just choose to Speak in Hindi at UN. UN is different where most people speak in Mother tounge and then they always have a interpreter. UN is where people come from many type of languages. Can't compare UN with US. It's fiar, when he uses such things for his PR and all those Godi media presents him as a Charismatic leader. You really wrote an essay just to say that you don't have problem with him not speaking english but him not being a good pm. The problem is the person you tried to argue with was never making the point you are trying to argue against. The commentor you replied to was addressing the person who made this post calling him out on \"bad english=dumb person\" mentality. Bhaiyo aur behno, kal se ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù hoga, aur ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù hoga. Supreme leader ki jai! Sorry, your comprehension skills are very low. I did not say he not knowing English is okay. In fact, I gave a reason that which everyone here are bashing me about. I would not have cared, but , all these people here having low standards on whom they elect is very sad. Because in most countries , diplomats of high caliber attend greatest universities and are required to know well. English is definitely no scale to judge a great speaker. And there is no doubt that Modi has greater oratory skills. The issue here is that he could've easily spoken Hindi and used an interpreter. But he chose to speak English for better PR and that is why it's important to criticize in this instance. I'm only commenting on the \"great speaker\" part. You should be able to have a good command over the language that you wish to express your ideas in if you want to be considered as a great speaker (amongst other qualities) . Not commenting on the person or his IQ here. >Sorry, your comprehension skills are very low This statement is so ironic i am actually laughing right now. You articulated your comment so poorly that you needed to edit your own comment and change the entire narrative so that anybody who reads the \"edited\" comment seem like my reply is not making sense. Sorry man i can't really argue further with a guy who uses pathetic things like editing the comment to make the replying person look dumb Yeah but for man claiming to be perfect and viswaguru, we need to criticize and show his place wherever possible And football soccer This is childish. There are real and important things to focus on and roast Modi. Not this Tharki unkill meant it the way he said it. Being able to speak properly in whichever language he chooses to speak in is kinda the bare minimum to judge for being a \"charismatic leader\" or a \"great speaker\". No one forced him to speak in English. Also, it's not like he doesn't often put both his feet in his mouth when he speaks in hindi. For example, 'beti bachao beti patao' . This is the way This just shows your dishonesty and I don't even understand the need for it. You just saw that I edited and then went ahead with your accusation. Wow!! Btw, Nowhere I intended not knowing English = dumb. You want to argue over nothing I guess. Yes, he should have spoken in Gujarati. I mean also have you considered the possibility [he meant what he said and said what he meant.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/modis-confidant-amit-shah-accused-of-illegal-snooping-of-woman-in-bangalore-217623-2013-11-14) It's his ideology. The BJP goons don't invest in girl child but they INVESTIGATE and INTIMIDATE girl who speaks the truth to the country. ( Brj Busn and many other cases) Well, maybe that was a Freudian skip. Iykyk. Tbh people should give him a break. It's not like he has been RBI governor or something. He is a chaiwala with bogus political science degree, so should not be judged for his english. Many comments here are calling out OP on using PM Modi's mistake in spoken English. I understand where they are coming from. For any other common person, I would've stood with those comments in their OP's critique. But this is our country's PM. And English is a key language for global communication. I think wishing for some command of such an important language is not too much to expect from the most important person of this country who seems to be doing everything everywhere all at once (judging by everyone attributing all success to Modi). Well US forced him to take questions from press. Could have easily demanded that the adress should then be in our language. You get a positive we get a positive. Fuckü§£ To be fair it's not his first language , so it's understandable. This is our representative on the global stage! Modiji should have stuck to Hindi in that case! Then dont make speeches in shit English in an English speaking country lmao. Lol, what questions? It was a pre-decided question because it's works great for his PR. The person who couldn't do an open press conference in India. Did took a singal question from US media?? Just look at other world leaders answering questions in US, this is a joke compare to them. He is reading off a teleprompter. Look, he's not wrong, you're all brain washed. We really should investigate them. I mean... am i the only one who wants to know why \"the girl child\" is the parent's favorate? Why does she always score better marks than me and why can't I have the bigger room! She even get's like that extra scoop of icecream bECauSe sHe's sMoLl. Modi's right, I don't buy it.. Ironically Modi is only the 3rd world leader (after Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela)to address the US Congress twice and co incidentally both were under the Democrats Biden makes mistakes even in his native language lol Hindi isn't his first language either What's your point? If you followed before the trip, the Indian diaspora didn't want to take that single question also. So the US did force him to take that question. I know that it was a single question but it wasn't for his PR. It was for Bidens in his country. I know this is a joke. The person I replied to said cant compare UN to US. I was saying for that matter. He could have surely asked for the adress to be in Hindi. He was forced to take questions. Edit: If you guys are getting angry that I said questions instead of question. Grow up. I use predictive text keyboard. Dont type it all out. I thought what he said about investigating was correct. No it's not, its about ego to show he can speak English. Memorable to who? Upper half of India? This is what I like about liberals. We don't stoop down to their level. This kind of sympathy will never be extended to RG by the conservatives. Upper half? They have breached till Karnataka. So complete India. Also, I was talking in hypotheticals. Please read again properly. I am talking about Hindi being a North Indian thing. The south doesn't care or can't even understand if Vajpayee speaks in Hindi. The south won't fall for the \"Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan\" shtick. You completely missed the point. This isn't about Modi. It's about whether any politician in India SHOULD be able to speak basic English. Oh you guys missed \"I don't have any continent left\" - Basically reading continent instead of content. So the Prime Minister of your country goes and addresses UN or US in a native language and you won't be proud of him or consider it historic? Leave the Hindi part aside. You seem to be too hostile towards it. Why speak Hindi when Vajpayee can perfectly speak in English which will have much better impact on international stage? WHO IS HE REPRESENTING? Of course if PM is not comfortable in English I will NEVER hold it against them. It‚Äôs fine to mispronounce. But for the great orator to so blatantly use two teleprompters while addressing the US congress is a bit much. Practice your speech man. Who is he representing? India. The language he spoke? Indian language. Fuck off with your propoganda that speaking Hindi is a disrespect to other languages of India. Get lost. Want RRR to be called Tollywood exclusively because it is but the Prime minister speaking Hindi? No no that's bad. Speak English. Why can't some people get it into their head that Hindi != India? > propoganda that speaking Hindi is a disrespect to other languages of India I NEVER said that. But I will repeat my question, **who is he representing?** Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan ‚òï The country should not investigate in him anymore. He should have spoken in Hindi. If Trump can Converse with Kim Jong Un then so can he. After all Indians are one of the prominent minorties over there. Also it would have been less embarassing. I never said Hindi= India. You seem to be taking it that way. Show me where I said that. And what is the point of repeating the question? I said India. If you equate it to that, you are in the wrong not me. This is one of the many reasons why Modi wins. The common man of this country is tired of the entitled nepotistic elite looking down on them. Modi has grown based on his own skills and hardwork from a poor humble background, and it seems a lot of people aren't able to digest it and want a sauve looking walking thesaurus who is one of them. Yehi mistake ko dekh ke andh bhkts ladkiyo ko actually investigate karenge because ‚Äúmuddy said so‚Äù All the people defending him saying he is speaking in a foreign language, yes he is being he is also in a foreign country and as the representative of our country with all resources at the palm of his hand I think speaking correctly is the least the old man can do when there are millions watching him Kinda disappointing Investigating in the girl child? Kya bak rha hai ye bawasir. We saw so many cases of your Beti bachao aur padhao failing to provide education as well as protection now it's taking a bad turn. Brij Bhushan should've been in your place. I wanted to see how a rapist reacts to the live public for their crimes and also in English. Tab gaya kyu bolne ke liye? Failed miserably to present a factual idea about his work for the country. At least in his own language he could've mesmerized the crowd by producing \"good but useless\" speech to people and that could be translated. Dude stop insulting Chai wala, they are far more intelligent than this cretin. Plus he probably lied about being a Chai wala as no Chai wala can afford to visit the US during 80s. Given the number of times moditards make pappu jokes, including often by removing context, it's fair to say, Modi deserves to be mocked for this. Ofcourse it's not as important as the many of his absolute wrong doings. He said exactly what he meant. What's here to see? OP how about you post a video of yourself giving a speech in your 3rd language? What a stupidly immature post. I mean, Hindi isn't even a real language, it arose out of a hodgepodge of N Indian languages, and wasn't anyone's native language until the 1700s. I‚Äôm really conflicted on one hand no should be made fun of for their English on the other hand any competent leader should know the global language I think Zelenskie stuck with his mothertongue What a perv!! south **indian** here. he spoke in hindi, which is one of the 22 official languages of the country. while i am also against the imposition of hindi on us, i applaud the fact that someone from **my** **country** spoke one of **our** official languages in the UN. it is memorable and historical. Oh please. These days, even the people who got actually English education struggle to speak and articulate stuff and you have a problem with a completely uneducated guy making a mistake? While I agree that, it's a very important place and a PM of a country should not make mistakes like these; I am fine with him being a visionary and not so fluent (but can still manage to communicate in English person) and someone who can speak good English and is dumb as fuck (you know who I am talking about). Just came down to comment this lol Somebody has investigations on his mind. Only the wrong kind, sadly. And who made you the representative of all Southern Indian states. Talk about yourself. He's not wrong. That's what happens in UP, Bihar, Haryana, and Rajasthan > Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan I think you are failing to understand the subtle propaganda in play here. The problem is they ***always*** choose Hindi out of the 22 official languages. Always messes up when coming to girl child. Remember \"Beti Patao\"? And that's ok. After all, Hindi is the 4th most spoken language in the world. But this does not mean that we should take to it, because this will mean cancelling our individual culture. We should spend more time supporting our languages- this means investing time to protest against the department of education that unfairly awards the teachers of Hindi, donating money to support artists of our local language and so on and so forth. Support the country as a whole, but work to keep our individual culture alive. This is just honest mistake he knows English very well here he has to keep the tone.. watch early 2000 videos of him speaking English you will be shocked It‚Äôs not his native language so it‚Äôs not really an issue. But, when one of his competitors (if at all we can consider him so) fumbles or misspeaks something like this, we make fun of that guy. Quite a hypocrisy! Doglapan It is for gujjus and bhakts mainly who would go mad seeing their saheb speaking english in the US. People living in Pushkar Rajasthan speak brtter english than most gujjus living in the US. The hidden deep meaning being .. that anyone who wants to determine the sex of an unborn child, to see if it‚Äôs a girl, ((investigating a girl child) will be arrested by the Police along with the whole family (lifts the entire family)"
