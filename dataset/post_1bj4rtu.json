    "selftext": "# What if you don't vote?\n\nHi, I've been talking to a lot of people recently, and lots of people don't want to cast their vote because many of them believe that the BJP will again win the 2024 election. Why they'll win is entirely a question in itself. They could influence just before elections (I will be doing a separate post on this). They could rig the elections, \\[links at bottom\\], and some other reasons too. But what if something happens, and none of their cards worked, and they solely win because the ones who would have voted for them were sleeping at home, chilling at some cafe, masturbating to porn... The last one is fine, and you can still cast your vote after doing your deed, unless you go extreme and do it for 11 hours straight (7 am - 6 PM). In that case, seek help... \n\nImagine how you would feel to be that person, and I'm not just talking to one of you, I'm talking to thousands/millions of you who would make that collective ONE. ONE who's against BJP, against fascism, against murders, against lynching, against terrorists and rapists in the Indian Parliament (be it any party).\n\n# Why should you vote?\n\nAs for the first-time voters, don't listen to whatever the F your elders are telling you. \"Humne toh kara vote, aaega toh Modi hi\" and all kinds of crap. You cast your vote and leave the rest to Murphy's Law.\n\nIf you plan to sit at home just because you already know the results, I would like to remind you of something that a wise guy said. Let's say BJP will win in the 2024 elections, but \"Not all battles are fought for victory. Some are fought to tell the world that someone was there on the battlefield.\"\n\n# What happens if you vote?\n\n\"HYPOTHETICALLY,\" Let's suppose that the BJP is gonna win the 2024 elections. It wins in a constituency with a lead of 50k votes. What if thousands/millions of you choose to vote? Well, now maybe BJP wins only with a 5k lead. It changes nothing, right? RIGHT? WRONG!\n\nIt will give the future generation HOPE. Instead of 50k, they have to only think, \"Oh, it was a close call last time, I should also cast my vote, maybe we win (BJP loses) this time, maybe BJP loses with 50k votes in every constituency.\" Seems impossible, right? Well, someone said \"I have a dream\" in 1963. It worked for him...\n\nIf you have seen Shawshank Redemption, there were 2 quotes regarding hope:\n\n1. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.”\n2. \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\"\n\nPick the one you like and act accordingly. We all know how that movie ended, and an alternative would have SUCKED. (Green Mile)\n\n# If you still do not wish to vote...\n\nAs for the people who strictly don't want to cast their vote just because they're upper class or belong to a certain category, caste, or religion, therefore it won't matter to them. Well, you enjoy your privilege, while you can...\n\nDon't think that your home is not on fire. Why should you care? Fire will catch up eventually, but no one will be there left to help you, and you might have been dealt the worst hand possible because you won't even have a shoulder to cry on or people to ask for help. Good luck with that.\n\nAs to the people who are not gonna vote solely for the reason that they think they're just too cool for this, I just want to tell them, >!\"Bhakk Bh##%$\\*d\"!<\n\nBook: [https://www.amazon.in/Democracy-Trust-Electronic-Voting-Machines/dp/8191006502](https://www.amazon.in/Democracy-Trust-Electronic-Voting-Machines/dp/8191006502)\n\nAdvani also criticised EVMs in 2009: [https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/advani-has-doubts-about-evm-wants-ballot-papers-back/](https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/advani-has-doubts-about-evm-wants-ballot-papers-back/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlrtwf6vyepc1.jpg?width=764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ce01e4273ef3d2504bedb668e5f278508dc44b4",

Based on these things, I don't want to vote for PM Modi anymore\n\nLet's come to the opposition. Have you seen their election manifesto? They are talking about removing the sealing of reservation of up to 50% which is a disaster. Already the Modi government has increased the reservation to 60% by giving 10% to EWS. This move has made the general category suffer heavily. A doctor has got all India rank 2 in neet pg and he can't get his dream branch in dream hospital because there was no seat for him. Imagine you work your ass off to get AIR 2 or even AIR 1 and still you can't get your dream college or dream branch. People from SC/ST category actually needs reservation, but why the fuck people from OBC category need it? People from the ST category have faced severe consequences of casteism (visit tribal areas of Odisha, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and you will find) and then people from SC category. They deserve reservations, but definitely not the people from OBC. Then they talk about implementation of msp as per swaminathan report which was actually published in 1992.

    "light_cleaned_title": "BJP will win the 2024 elections, all us of know it, BUT...",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "# What if you don't vote? Hi, I've been talking to a lot of people recently, and lots of people don't want to cast their vote because many of them believe that the BJP will again win the 2024 election. Why they'll win is entirely a question in itself. They could influence just before elections (I will be doing a separate post on this). They could rig the elections, \\[links at bottom\\], and some other reasons too. But what if something happens, and none of their cards worked, and they solely win because the ones who would have voted for them were sleeping at home, chilling at some cafe, masturbating to porn... The last one is fine, and you can still cast your vote after doing your deed, unless you go extreme and do it for 11 hours straight (7 am - 6 PM). In that case, seek help... Imagine how you would feel to be that person, and I'm not just talking to one of you, I'm talking to thousands/millions of you who would make that collective ONE. ONE who's against BJP, against fascism, against murders, against lynching, against terrorists and rapists in the Indian Parliament (be it any party). # Why should you vote? As for the first-time voters, don't listen to whatever the F your elders are telling you. \"Humne toh kara vote, aaega toh Modi hi\" and all kinds of crap. You cast your vote and leave the rest to Murphy's Law. If you plan to sit at home just because you already know the results, I would like to remind you of something that a wise guy said. Let's say BJP will win in the 2024 elections, but \"Not all battles are fought for victory. Some are fought to tell the world that someone was there on the battlefield.\" # What happens if you vote? \"HYPOTHETICALLY,\" Let's suppose that the BJP is gonna win the 2024 elections. It wins in a constituency with a lead of 50k votes. What if thousands/millions of you choose to vote? Well, now maybe BJP wins only with a 5k lead. It changes nothing, right? RIGHT? WRONG! It will give the future generation HOPE. Instead of 50k, they have to only think, \"Oh, it was a close call last time, I should also cast my vote, maybe we win (BJP loses) this time, maybe BJP loses with 50k votes in every constituency.\" Seems impossible, right? Well, someone said \"I have a dream\" in 1963. It worked for him... If you have seen Shawshank Redemption, there were 2 quotes regarding hope: 1. \"Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.” 2. \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" Pick the one you like and act accordingly. We all know how that movie ended, and an alternative would have SUCKED. (Green Mile) # If you still do not wish to vote... As for the people who strictly don't want to cast their vote just because they're upper class or belong to a certain category, caste, or religion, therefore it won't matter to them. Well, you enjoy your privilege, while you can... Don't think that your home is not on fire. Why should you care? Fire will catch up eventually, but no one will be there left to help you, and you might have been dealt the worst hand possible because you won't even have a shoulder to cry on or people to ask for help. Good luck with that. As to the people who are not gonna vote solely for the reason that they think they're just too cool for this, I just want to tell them, >!\"Bhakk Bh##%$\\*d\"!< Book: [https://www.amazon.in/Democracy-Trust-Electronic-Voting-Machines/dp/8191006502](https://www.amazon.in/Democracy-Trust-Electronic-Voting-Machines/dp/8191006502) Advani also criticised EVMs in 2009: [https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/advani-has-doubts-about-evm-wants-ballot-papers-back/](https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/advani-has-doubts-about-evm-wants-ballot-papers-back/) &#x200B;",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I'll try to vote. I am out of my hometown, can I vote in Bangalore? Kya pata haar jaaye Pradan Sevak, i would keep my hopes pinned to the minutest of possibility of a miraculous tectonic shift in our nation's collective consciousness. Sadly Gullu jaise logon k rehte to mushkil h bro Yaar inke pass hai bhi toh 100 x gullu. Ornob, Navika, Chaman Chopra, Tihadi to name a few. Vote share is a significant thing, all political parties try to focus on vote share. So even if the opposition party does not win, but if the vote share of the second best party has increased significantly, it'll create the right signals for everyone involved (incl BJP) In 2019 (BJP peak) the vote share for NDA is 45%, so there are 55% people who do not support the establishment, do not lose hope that there is no chance, in politics nothing is written in stone, if you do not support the current establishment - the best thing you can do is to vote for the second best party (or any regional party that is not in NDA) 90% from both sides are gullu only (I assume it means something dumb). It's just one side is good at marketing and psychological warfare and has a lot of powerful institutions in hand. Sabse bda question toh ye h can we trust NaMo govt to not rig the votes. They're controlling anyway almost all the things in the process. No No, Gullu is this guy abb kare toh kare kya, bole toh bole kya At this point congress nepotism factor is wat is preventing them from winning. As soon as they change their PM candidate, so many people are going to vote for them just to see what happens. Ye toh dalal hai, gullu bol k cuteness kyu badha rahe iski? If you get to vote in the next elections... I think in the shenanigans of political parties, political ideologies and all the drama and corruption we forgot what the elections really stand for… we don’t elect our PM or CM… we don’t elect our ministers… our only job to to elect a representative at the state and central level who will collectively listen to us and present our opinion at the state and central level..the concept of winning or loosing should be irrelevant to the matter..it’s like asking someone what is ur favourite fruit and he replying I don’t want to answer coz most ppl won’t like it…our vote is our way to advocate for ourselves.. to make our voices herd.. it is the only place where you can truly select what u want and nobody can question ur choice.. why do u want to give up on such a freedom… Dangai ki jaan EVM main hai You cannot deny that there is family politics in keeping RG still as PM candidate. BJP is doing what's best for their party. Congress is not. People will not vote for them unless there is a solid candidate there. Also there is trend in Indian politics, Whatever party comes stays for years until it becomes unbearable. ok I will vote for BJP If you're voting sensibly then it's cool dude. It's your right. Nothing against it but just want to say is sense k sath UPSC ki preparation karega toh nahi hone wala tera. I have also right to freedom of speech.🤦🏻‍♂️ Getting a strong opposition is also a victory for us. But If BJP wins with a big margin like 80/20 it's game over. i literally think i need to make a new populist party to country the bjp UPSC mei kisika bhi nahi hota, Tera bhi nahi hoga First time voter here, I am voting against the current establishment i.e. BJP. Idc if they win again, I'll still be happy that I voted against them. have you seen the congress manifesto ? I can only see reservations and providing freebies, no talk about fixing the ground level issues. I am a staunch BJParty hater ( go see my profile). But I in my good conscience cannot vote for Congress also. I didn't try, so you would never know. I have a dream...NOTA winning election but BJP has also done significant improvements too. And even if BJP isn't good enough, think to yourself, is the opposition good? Do you actually want Rahul Gandhi to be PM? Is he better than Modi? Will he actually do literally any ANY good to the country? I know BJP isn't good, but the opposition is worse. After 2014, did not vote in 2019 because of government policies but will vote again this time to the party you are against Three valid reasons 1) Last 5 yrs has been one of the best for India in terms of tough decision making, schemes and development. 2) Current Hindu-Muslim issue online and on the ground level is not at an alarming level to worry about. 3) Opposition and those leading them are 100 times worse than BJP. Dividing people on caste is ok for you and changing the constitution for caste based vote bank politics is ok for you as per their manifesto coupled with many vague promises and economic debt ridden appeasement policies. As a first-time voter, how do you think in recent days you're being targeted by political parties to vote for them? Do you remember any obvious trigger points around you in person or digitally? You would win in gambling but you can't crack UPSC. The seats are very less especially for General. JEE, NEET are way way easier Good morning, wake up. Sir, please provide evidence before claiming evms are hackable. If you have talent, you can take next left turn to ECI to hack and bring BJP to knees. Good sir, you can singlehandedly defeat BJP by bringing evidence that EVMs are actually hackable. Sir, I am counting on you. Advani was as much of a truth speaker that opposition is today. Opposition always lie to win. Same BJP would be crying their hearts out on EVM if they lose elections. Here's the Election Commission challenge for hacking EVM: [https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ec-issues-open-challenge-to-hack-evms/article17954709.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ec-issues-open-challenge-to-hack-evms/article17954709.ece) NOTA can't win election That would only divide the Opposition vote. AAP was supposed to be just that, but they were brought down by a party with enormous access to political donations, control over agencies and media. Good points. From the post: >Book: [https://www.amazon.in/Democracy-Trust-Electronic-Voting-Machines/dp/8191006502](https://www.amazon.in/Democracy-Trust-Electronic-Voting-Machines/dp/8191006502) >Advani also criticised EVMs in 2009: [https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/advani-has-doubts-about-evm-wants-ballot-papers-back/](https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/advani-has-doubts-about-evm-wants-ballot-papers-back/) I hope Narasimha Rao and LK Advani get back to you soon on this. I just quoted them, as I mentioned the \"link at the bottom\", and I have attached these already. Liberals try not to quote MLK who disliked liberals challenge : impossible 100 times worse how? Just Vote. Vote for India and for you Must be a liberal-specific problem, how would I know, I'm just using \"common sense\". Read the opposition's poll manifesto with an unbiased mind. Stupidest argument ever made, “If not Modi, then who?” Dude, literally anyone will be 1. More educated than that teleprompter comedian. 2. Will have more integrity than someone whose only job is to promote crony cpitalists. Helping Adani get projects in Sri Lanka etc. 3. Will not make the IT anf ED departments ( supposedly independent constitutional bodies) it’s 3rd and 4th arms to help it extort money and letting donors get away with large scale corruption. Please stop this cheap excuse for an argument, “If not modi then who”. Look inward, it should be anyone but an illiterate puppet who dances to the tunes of his corporate masters and who doesnt have the integrity to do one unscripted interview in 10 years of being PM. And people still try, I wonder why, just like the RAT RACE I ran for [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in my days. It's okay, happens to all of us. You say vote against BJP, I agree but vote who? The problem here is that for most, if not all, people the vote IS to elect the supreme leader. That's what the propaganda machine is all about. \"If you give your vote, then we will have the supreme leader who will solve all your problems and more importantly will hurt the people you hate\" i am saying i would make a party with hardlier hindutva and take away the bjp hindutva vote 🥰 Ofcourse. They will have to redo it all over. But for once when nobody wins, it says something. I wanted to vote against BJP this time, but saw nyay shananigan of Congress yesterday, Now I'm thinking of getting out of India. Unfortunately that’s the sad reality.. we have forgotten the basis principles of elections.. I am not sure where you are going. With all the talk around reservation and fighting Hinduism's 'shakti', people are actually looking towards BJP for HOPE. I would suggest people to not settle for BJP vs INC for the elections. Go though all the candidates in your constituency and see what's their vision. Take a day off it possible. If a candidate is seeking re-election find out how they spent their MP fund for the last term. Congress manifesto is invitation to poverty. Voting BJP to keep genius of Rahul Gandhi out. The parties which generally targeted me were BJP and BJD, mostly it was BJP because their ads were everywhere, starting from YouTube to educational websites. I am an atheist and I am someone who believes in social democracy. I don't like how BJP uses the majority religion as their scrapegoat for votes. I am also tired of the violence happening in the country due to the same. Most of their ministers are also openly anti-secular. I also have problems with the UCC that they implemented in Uttarakhand, it's filled with conservative ideas and is against live-in relationships. Plus, I am not approving of BJP's crony capitalism. So, no matter how they advertise themselves in front of me, I am not voting for them. Because their ideologies will never fit with mine. Aur fap Krna band krde jb parents ghr pe na ho They still playing this WhatsApp gimmick in 2024? I thought it was over in 2019, Gosh, 5 years and they still couldn't come up with a better plan. Modi vs Who? WHOEVER THE FUCK IS MORE ELIGIBLE and there are shit tons of people out there. The problem is people don't have the free-thinking to research other available options, If I were to ask \"HOW IS MODI BETTER THAN THIS GUY?\" 80% of the people can't answer it. It's the same as people chant \"MODI MODI MODI\" in news interviews and when they ask \"Tell me any 3 things Modi has done?\", They're numb and can't say anything, maybe Ram Mandir and Sec 370 (which they again can't explain in depth).. Snap out of this Modi vs Who loop. Even local independent candidates will be better than Indi Alliance. Any degenerate walking the street has the same voting rights as me. This idea to me is absurd. I will never vote in my entire life. Also, people talk about what will happen if everyone thinks like that. One, everyone is not as important to me, and two, I have no control or influence over what they think. This is like prisoner's dilemma. There is one optimal choice for both cases. But you should be glad about it because I'm pro development (bjp). Well i support more of brs and bjp. Hate congress here (TG). BRS party dont seem to be at good position rn here. So it is what it is. I just dont like congress lol. Doesnt mean i like bjp. Its just that by default when u hate a party, u support the opposing one rite? 😂. Dont worry if there brs comes back i will vote it. I will vote against BJP , not because i loke congress ... their manifesto is shitty populist but i am tired of this radical shit. i am tired of religion based politics. Aayega toh modi hi Dude, check the report card of the current govt. How they performed in different sectors. Keep a broader view of all possibilities and on a neutral stance see if we are going in the right direction. Check the manifesto of each party and track how much they accomplished. Vote based on your result Kyu bhai? Tatti khane ki aadat hi pad gayi hai kya ab? aur kuch? 💅🏻 Ravish kumar ke quotes post kr rha h ,tatti toh tu khud khata h Jee mains* Good point and a logical one. I will include that in the next post. With this post, I just wanted to trigger people to consider voting. Maybe he can garland some rapists and you would run to the nearest booth. Keep drinking the cow piss kool aid. What development trains that crash or bridges that fall ? Why? Propaganda. You are taking someone seriously who put up a quote by Ravish Kumar?😂😂 Game over - can you elaborate, please? Didn't know i had to take permission from some random guy on reddit on how to vote lmao. Tell me any 5 bad things about Ravish Kumar, If you convince me (with logical points and proofs) toh abhi k abhi gaali dunga RK ko and I will apologise to you publicly here. Go on. I challenge you. Modi is an experienced politician and diplomat. Hate on him as much as you want, youve got all the rights. Mans still done a decent job with the nation, let's see what the people choose! Why the hell do you still have bjp as an option? Don't care who else, just not bjp. Okay, so. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (insert any politician's name of your choice) is an experienced politician and diplomat. Hate on him as much as you want, youve got all the rights. Mans still done a decent job with the nation, let's see what the people choose! That's my argument too, Thanks for your time. 🤝 instead of not voting try NOTA, let everyone know that you don't stand with what any of options available Personally, I would like to vote either based on past performance or the election manifesto. We all know the BJP sucked in economic performance, China border issues, electrol bonds, PM care fund, education, healthcare, demonetisation, hatred based politics and many other things, though it has achieved good results by abolishing 370, keeping Pakistan on their knees, GST (even though bad implementation) and a couple of more things. Based on these things, I don't want to vote for PM Modi anymore Let's come to the opposition. Have you seen their election manifesto? They are talking about removing the sealing of reservation of up to 50% which is a disaster. Already the Modi government has increased the reservation to 60% by giving 10% to EWS. This move has made the general category suffer heavily. A doctor has got all India rank 2 in neet pg and he can't get his dream branch in dream hospital because there was no seat for him. Imagine you work your ass off to get AIR 2 or even AIR 1 and still you can't get your dream college or dream branch. People from SC/ST category actually needs reservation, but why the fuck people from OBC category need it? People from the ST category have faced severe consequences of casteism (visit tribal areas of Odisha, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and you will find) and then people from SC category. They deserve reservations, but definitely not the people from OBC. Then they talk about implementation of msp as per swaminathan report which was actually published in 1992. Why didn't they implement it earlier? Now tell me who to vote for? Politics in our country is largely driven by caste, religion and freebies. It's never driven by sustainable growth (environment), economic performance, healthcare and education Did you love the bjp manifesto? What did you like about that? Why is any one person or part being bad bring you back to bjp which is the most criminal of them all? sadly its not in the cards yet you like it or not but opposition is a joke, they are still riding the minority for votes and modi made it a hindu vs anti hindu fight and opposition fell in his trap, hindus are not that dumb to vote for somebody who is fighting shakti, trying to eradicate sanatan dharma. BJP will win because they did what they said, atleast most of the major things, ram mandir is a big set back for opposition, hindus wont forget that day for the 10 years atleast. For most people modi is not an option, no question of if not bjp. The only question is who is the best among the rest. Why do you consider yourself as special Is it not preferable to bjp manifesto? What points did you like about bjp manifesto? Your position is the person against the BJP candidate in your constituency in your locality. Check the records, all information is available on the EC website and do independent research. Vote for the deserving one, that one could be a BJP guy only. The problem is that people think the election is between Modi vs Rahul vs Mamta vs Kejriwal vs XYZ. It's not. When people get powerful, they will drop the ladder that got them there to avoid anyone else coning up. Politicians should always churn every 5 years. As mentioned I am rooting for them for what they have done, Abrogation of 370, infrastructure, defense, tax relief for the middle class, practical schemes for the poor like housing, minimum wages, toilets etc. the good candidate was from samajwadi party and we were voting him from last 2 elections, he switched to BJP this week :P not this week, maybe this month? Yea same. First time voter here. I didn't want to vote bjp, but after seeing the congress manifesto, I will definitely not vote congress Can't keep bringing out facts every time someone says something \"smart\". That's such a childish way to talk tho, rather funny :) >As I said, no logical points, no detailed discussion on policies and stuff, no numbers comparison, no manifesto comparison and so on. I still hear more sense out of the Modi in his \"Mann ki baat\"(cringe ik) than I ever did from RaGa in even his greatest speeches(like the one he fucked up Lok Sabha). It's funny uk, I actually find RaGa to be a really nice guy. But man never did learn how to be a good diplomat. And self confidence on a person shows. Tharoor is a different story. Wish congress atleast gave him the chance at the PM race lmao. Don't need no facts to understand those blunders ;) Wasn't their vote share 37%? Only option seems to be NOTA as of now How about inflation, unemployment , excessive taxation, riots, pardoning criminals, attacking protestor, protecting rapists and abusers, supporting and promoting pseudoscience, misinformation campaigns, corrupting and poisoning mass media, lowering hdi, lots of deaths during covid due to inaction, demonetisation and major policies decided overnight with no logic? Schemes for the poor are mentioned in the manifesto that you rejected, any reason for the selective rejection and praise? Go by stats not statements. Compare all the above with last 10 yrs of BJP vs last 10 yrs of Congress. Consider global cues like COVID and War that affected every country and then let's talk. I wonder which stats made you think bjp is better. I doubt the authenticity of those, but if that is the reason will you be willow to share the same? You claimed something, so you should back them up with valid proofs. What I have mentioned are based on facts. As for schemes mentioned in congress manifesto, you can claim that you will settle people on the moon, how is the question?. Because he had access to education, healthcare and other opportunities that degenerates walking on the street doesn't. This sort of elitist attitude is why a Supreme Leaders propaganda is absolute He makes you believe he is an OBC leader from Poor Family running the country and doing everything possible to give rights to the improvised Look at the type of slurs and adhominems they use against their opposition they call them Andolan Jeevi, Tukde Tukde Gang, Protest Jeevi, Librandu, Shehzada ... They're is this overwhelming feeling among Supreme Leaders Devots that people who oppose them are rich English speaking elites who believe in Western Foreign Values. There is not going to be much of a difference either way. BJP will win. I've given up on democracy here. I understand your points but I still won't vote because of the unfortunate and unchangeable situation of the Indian politics I don't vote because all elections are pointless. You are repeating you have the facts, but don't want to share them. I go by statements and not facts as per your own comment. So I am asking again, can you share the facts that you go by? Big boss elections too? Shit. /s Please vote. It’s your duty in a democracy. Even if you vote NOTA pls do Yeah, so decent a state literally has been burning for months now with nary a peep from Mr. “experienced politician”. > If you're voting sensibly then it's cool dude. It's your right. Should've just left it at that but you had be moron and insult the guy. And in reality we don't have complete freedom of speech. to those people who have problem of masturbation: do it. once you get post nut clarity, it would a clear choice to vote. I know people are hating on you. But I totally agree with you. The level of misuse of power BJP has conducted is on another level. And they are brainwashing people with black paper on how bad opposition used to be If you don't vote, you don't have the right to complain about the election result, you don't have the right to complain about the state of the country or your state or your city. Simple as that. The only way for non-majority voices to be heard is through voting. Shameless IT Cell employee at it again. > Current Hindu-Muslim issue online and on the ground level is not at an alarming level to worry about. Right, go ask Bilkis Bano what she thinks about the “ground level”. Fucking privileged chodes never went out of their housing societies and want to talk about “ground level”. > Not all battles are fought for victory. Some are fought to tell the world that someone was there on the battlefield. Could not agree more. I plan to vote NOTA!! You are telling me that r/India people are actually Indian people with proper voter registration. Delusional! Are you claiming there are no independent candidates in your constituency? So you say whatever you want and then it's supposed to be on me to prove whether your statements are right or wrong 😂. Read my original comment, infrastructure - Sela pass and other such tunnels through the mountains connecting extreme parts of India, border roads in ladakh and arunachala sanctioned, highways, electrification of railways etc. Posting this as it's not popular. Defense:- All time high exports, indigenous push and after 20 yrs finally budgetary sanction for AMCA Article 370 For congress to deserve votes, they need to first let their good leaders lead from the front. I agree. Either way, I AM voting this time around. I have been bitching and moaning about the BJP coming to power, but I haven't done anything about it. About fucking time I did. Whoever wins, it's not going to be a secular party, so why would hindus willingly vote against modi and hindu intersets to support opposition who sides with islamists who are just waiting to wipe out hindus from india? Why would Indians who dislike china vote against modi for not being able to hold back china when the opposition mother and son actively support china and have signed agreements with ccp lobby? Unlike reddit liberals who live in their own privileged bubble of delusion blindly aping the western political dichotomy and applying to completely incompatible indian society and refuse to hold minorities accountable and support measures against them when they radicalize enough to generate reactionary radicalization from the majority. I'll cut to the chase, as long as as liberals and left of india doesn't acknowledge radicalized muslims as the root cause of raising radicalization of hindus, keeps whitewashing atrocities of islamic rule of the subcontinent, keeps up the crabs in the bucket mentality when dealing with racism from the west (let me give an example, when a white woman got raped in india, you all screamed hindu culture is rape culture even though the rapist were not even hindu, but when an indian man was murdered in america, these same people blamed the indians saying indians should know better about where they are going) and put other indians down to show their loyalty and wag their tail in front of westerners (who btw will never respect you or accept you no matter what), keeps supporting the divisive sub nationalism (btw, american deplomat openly stated about supporting and stoking subnationalism in India), doesn't have explicitly stated manifestoes that promises reeducation of muslim society in india towards accepting co existence as an option and reform islam to not hinder the progress of the country (i.e basically have the courage to openly say they will not support islamists and are willing to take the approach of singapore rather than letting what happened in lebanon a once christian majority country repeat in india), and provide clear golas of what development projects they will accomplish instead of behaving like dacoits who try to legally bribe the citizens (direct cash welfare is actually good when everyone pays their fair share of taxes which we are not), doesn't show ambitions of infrastructures and industrialization, any common indian hindu with a sense of self preservation and more than two brain cells will never support you. Yeah, I agree. That one was bad on my part, an impulsive decision. Shouldn't have persuaded after that sentence. I said it, gotta accept the consequences, would have deleted or edited my comment but wouldn't been fair. What are alarming levels for you? Islamophobia in India is at an all time high. Targetted beef lynchings, the new bulldozer culture, Hindu desh khatre me hai... the list is endless. All this has become so common now that it barely makes news. Do you want more bodies to start dropping for it to reach \"alarming levels\"?? Wow, I read the first few sentences, anyone other than modi is an islamist. You can continue living in your delusion. I don't see any point is discussing. You would still vote for modi if he is proven to be a secret islamist. You are supporting modi for allowing china to walk into India without consequences and claim to be against china. You are completely in the delusion. There is no solution for you. Yes that was shameful, of government early release of the convicts but if one incident tarnishes everything done then recently a blast happened in Karnataka. Does it mean congress is supporting terroism?. >inflation Inflation is under control.

Our healthcare infrastructure was initially simply not capable of dealings with a crisis which broke countries like America. Production of masks and PPT kits were initially nonexistent. Vaccination program was good. It could have been worse judging from the population density of the country. Rest of your criticisms are subjective, so I will refrain from responding to it lest I mix my own opinions in the reply. Understandable have a great day. For you BJP might be the worst option but for indian hindus it's not. you don't see any problem of oppostion sucking up to muslims for vote bank politics, so hindus also don't see anything wrong in BJP doing the same but instead of muslims they are the ones being appeased which is great for them, Why would they not eat at a hotel that puts more on their plate? you are voting based on your religious bias and bigotry, hindus are doing the same. Excellent Post. Will def do so Yes. U may see South Delhi constituency yourself > Yes the Bilkis Bano case was shameful of the government by early release of the convicts but if one incident tarnishes everything done then recently a blast happened in Karnataka. Does it mean congress is supporting terroism? If the congress shamelessly commits fraud in court to release them, praises the convicts to have “brahmin sanskaar”, and brings them up with them on their rallies, yes, they would be supporting terrorism. > Recently two youths from a minority community slit the throats of two teens. And they were immediately arrested. Meanwhile rapists literally roamed IIT-BHU to look for women to rape because they knew BJP would keep their hands off. > Then you had the guj university issue where students were harmed for namaz on campus. The one where the VC blamed the foreign students for attack by outside goons? Just solidifies my point even better. BJP is making shit worse on the actual ground, even if they might try to game stats by refusing to file FIRs. > Hate speech has increased no doubt but social media is the accelerator. Such incidents get viral and form an exaggerated and generalised view about the situation. Right, and the 30 lakh+ IT Cell recruits (that’s just the latest recruits) have nothing to do with it. Sure. That state has been burning since decades. If you go deep enough in the history of the state, you'll realise the current issues stem from the ineptness of Congress. BJP is also being a fucking Cunt. Modi is certainly not talking on it. Iam just waiting for a detailed documentary/coverage by our army/or just some unbiased source. Social media may be the accelerator, but these things are happening on the ground. Social media is just making sure we hear about these things BJD has better realtion in national politics with BJP. Mr.Dimwit why should i bother after all these. I would rather discuss with more intelligent people. This is good, this will remind BJP that their hold is not untouchable and force them to start improving their game. Yup, not denying hate speech has increased but for me not to the extent that it outweighs the good done so far by the government. I disagree on that, but maybe our experiences are different. I have seen people around me say outright that Muslims should be kicked out and all that. But then again, I do live in UP, so yeah If all sanghi haters vote, the BJP won't even get a majority. That's the reality. Vote to not allow NDA to get an overwhelming majority. Simple. That way, they can't force laws and changes in the constitution without heavy criticism from the opposition. Today, they have the power to do literally anything, with the SC being the only institution standing in their way. Do not vote NOTA. Just vote anyone other than NDA. Except if you feel a candidate has done good to your constituency even if they belong to NDA, sure, vote for them. The book doesn't actaually say anything about the EVMs we use being hackable, there is followup statement where advani retracted his claims. you don't look smart when you do the gotcha link bullshit, you'll only embarass yourself when someone calls out on your bluff. Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think Modi has it as easy as everyone thinks he does. Not saying he will lose, but the votes are definitely going to be lower than it did in 2019. And I think BJP is sensing this too. They are being extremely accomodating to their coalition partners this time unlike the previous election when they treated others as indispensible. And all coalition partners that treat Congress as shit too actually works in the favor of the INDIA alliance. Parties like Samajwadi who have greater local presence have also gotten greater constituencies to fight for. And this improves the winnability of the opposition. While I wish for an opposition win, I think eventually this will be an NDA win and not merely BJPs. There are extremes on both sides but Hindus get highlighted more because they are in the majority. I was putting all my stocks on Congress, then RG came up with the masterstroke of pushing beyond 50% reservation for lower castes (and OBCs) after doing a caste census, and then there are countless leftist folks on twitter demanding reseravtion in the private sector. With AI already being on track to devour a vast majority of IT sector jobs, how do you think General caste (not all of which are upper caste, there are middle castes who did not oppress and were not oppressed) \"meritorious\" folks find themselves employed? Anyway, the concept of merit and skills are taking big hits on account of artificial intelligence. You spent years learning how to draw and animate. DallE and Midjourney can do it way faster. You spent years practising coding and honing your skills. Devin can do faster. Their guarantees did not mention anything about starting SEZs, incentivizing MSMEs, and starting factories that will provide employment. They want to pay unemployment benefits, and I am all for it. But they should also pay attention to job creation. But that's always going to be the case. The majority has the power in their hands, and as such, should be held to higher standards. The damage that can be caused by an erratic majority is a lot higher. We also have to agree that, in some constituencies, all things considered, the BJP candidate might still turn out to be the best choice for many. In this case, is it still advisable to vote against them just sway the central narrative? True but base your analysis on facts. Go back to partition and history. Many more harsher events have happened. Hindus by default are pacifist and secular but under the BJP an image has been built that it's only Hindus who are being secular while others assert their religious identities. Compare bjp manifesto and bjp manifesto After seeing Congress I will vote for the BJP,. My whole family will vote sp/Congress though >the BJP candidate might still turn out to be the best choice for many. I agree here and I have agreed to this multiple times on this post only. If it's a good option, go for the BJP guy. The vote should be a logical one, not based on hate for someone. Also, there are a handful of good guys in the BJP who are doing good work in their constituency. I disagreed with this lad because he was just here to crack a joke and act funny for karma. He would have said some logical stuff I would have agreed to it or had a discussion, just the way you asked nicely I'm replying nicely. The central agenda is the ideology of the BJP which you can't just dismantle overnight, you gotta take away their powers first. If people voted logically then some would still go for BJP, and some wouldn't. It would be a fair election. I read the whole comment, he actually points out that the points you criticise modi for the opposition is doing worse in that exact field. they maybe the largest party but if you dont VOTE they WILL SURELY WIN! BUT IF YOU DO VOTE AGAINST THEM they maybe the largest party and yet be tamed because they will need coalition partners and once you are in coalition you cannot spread hate that easily! All he said was he will vote bjp There is nothing in the Congress manifesto for me. They are bringing ops for which I will not get anything, maybe I need to try a government job after my company layoff Not at all. Way to support delusions. Your comment is no way related to anything said by the previous person. For all those people thinking of voting NOTA, I interviewed the Chief Election Officer in 2017 and here's what he said: If 50 people out of a 100 decide to vote NOTA, the winner is decided from the remaining 50 votes that have been cast. Even if 99 out of a 100 people vote NOTA, the last 1 vote decides the winner. If you think by voting NOTA you're \"sending a message\", it's a message **nobody will read**. This was shocking to me as I also voted NOTA in the past. The reality is that the only reason politicians get away with whatever they do is because we don't get involved, for whatever reason. That's it. Till they don't feel the pushback, they have no reason to care. Your fear of repercussions only tightens their hold over keeping your life miserable while they get what they want. I know choosing the \"lesser of two evils\" seems like a cop out, but don't throw your vote away. Vote for a party, then hold those fuckers accountable for not delivering the kind of governance you want. Get together with others who want things to change, raise your voices together and let them know that nothing less than their best will do. **THEY ARE YOUR EMPLOYEES, NOT YOUR BOSSES.** Zk Dafuq, this is shocking to me too. Can you share the reference link to your interview if it was posted somewhere? BJP's won 37% of the vote share, NDA's vote share was around 45%. but his specialization is a state burning lol wdym, understand your supreme leader atleast. look at this btw found it in a Random subreddit, people are crazy as of now I do not understand this brainwashing. Islamic terrorists are the worst thing that happened to muslims. Bjp and their hindu terrorism agenda is the greatest disaster to be inflicted on hinduism. Why would people like to promote extremism and terrorism in their own religion? Your vendetta against BJP is laudable, and you do take it to ridiculous lengths. Since you have appealed to those who have the time to go thru lengthy posts on SM, esp since you have shouted out \"against fascism, against murders, against lynching, against terrorists and rapists in the Indian Parliament (be it any party).\" \"Be it any party\" was a nice sleight of hand, considering that your beef (no pun intended) was entirely with the BJP. If murderers, lynchers and terrorists are your bugbears, then BJP would obviously be the wrong place to look for them. As for rapists, unfortunately nobody seems to have a monopoly upon them, the Nyay seeking head of certain parties included! And then fascism....the usual fallback option of those who have no clue of what it means. The only tryst that I sia has ever had with fascism was when the Govt was headed by the grandmother of the Clown Prince, who was the closest to a dictator that we have ever had. Trust me I used to be a fan of his reports and journalism, but now he is no better than those other people who you see on the TV. He is just other side of the extreme(left leaning). No journalist should give their opinion on a news or a report, they should just present the information as it is. He tries to paint everything black and white with his opinions. Left leaning. What is left leaning? Pray tell me? Fucker sits and rattles off RW buzzwords without any sense of conviction. left-leaning adjective: left-leaning sympathetic to or tending towards the left in politics. \"a left-leaning professor\" Toh ? Tera chacha hai ? Improvements in what ? Smart cities are dead , Make in India is dead ( don't go by stupid announcements , check actual industrial output and employment , they haven't increased much under Modi ) , China shows Laal danda now instead of Laal aankh , skill india is dead , aatmanirbhar bharat only helped in the toy industry , Namami Gange is dead Only good things Modi did - toilets , Jan dhan yojana , Jal yojana etc were done in the first term , second term has been a clown show and third term is gonna be an entire circus even though I am a BJP supporter, yeah you're right, shortening their gaps not only applies pressure on them that people can get tired of their shenanigans and that they should work more for the betterment of the people, because that's how democracy should work, every MP/MLA/person in power should always remember it won't take much to take it all away. If you are okay with the functioning of the current govt or the state of nation then NOTA is fine, else **vote for a change**. We may fail but at least we did our best. NOTA is not the best option if you want a change. Haa fir? If you are okay with the functioning of the current govt or the state of nation then NOTA is fine, else **vote for a change**. We may fail but at least you did your best. NOTA is not the best option if you want a change. Vote for whatever you think is the lesser of the evils and good for the country. Life is a compromise, you won't always get everything you want. Honestly, I personally do not see a difference between one corrupt party playing off votebank politics and another corrupt party playing votebank politics. Your yardstick might vary. So, I don't want to pick a pile of shit over another pile of shit. Additionally, I don't vote for parties but candidates, including going over the financial, and political history. So the change, if any, would not improve the QoL for me (or my vision for our nation) Thus NOTA is my best option Vote is my right and duty. I will vote for the party that stands for India and NOT for a party that stands for a particular religion.

Bruh. I accept bjp isn’t a good party. But if you look at the alternative we have, bjp is far far better. Its not about choosing a good party. Its about choosing a party that’s a lesser evil. Are you seeing what rahul gandhi is promising? If he forms govt and seeks to implement even 1% of what he is promising, he will take india back to the dark ages. The other parties in the opposition alliance are literally scum. Rjd is known for its jungle raaj sarkar. Samajwadi party is known for causing riots during its govt. Bjp is the best we have and until a good party doesn’t emerge, i’d go and vote bjp and convince others to do so, because i can’t imagine what’d happen in india if the opposition alliance accidentally wins. Every individual has a certain perspective, based on that evaluate how the current govt has performed and vote accordingly. For me, I look at infrastructure, education, health and overall economy.

Damn it must be sad to be so afraid of minorities everyday. In what universe does a Hindutva party who runs parliament have less power, political reach, or cultural influence than Islamic extremists? If they didn't have Muslims,they would choose another religious minority as a scapegoat anyway. How can you say Islamists in specific are the root cause of Hindu extremism? (if they were radicals they would try to fix things, not exaggerate them). And Congress doesn't side with Muslims, they use them as leverage to win votes , our so called great \"formal\" democracy . Atleast China sorted their shit out from western imperialism, put restrictions on billionaires,even set up those re-education camps for Ughyur Muslim extremists . Our politics are way too infiltrated by the interests of the ruling class to have an easy fix. It's interesting how our PM can't care less about real issues like Ladakh protest, Farmers protest and Manipur violence rather he woukd only play petty politics on religious radicalization as elections come closer. Your benchmark is not the same as mine. Also, I want to add that do NOT press NOTA. DO NOT PRESS NOTA. Took me a long time to realize how dumbfuck of a human you have to be to press NOTA, I was that dumbfuck. If you press NOTA, it simply means you are indifferent to the plight and current occurences. So, please vote for the opposite party who are part of the india alliance so that they have a fighting chance to oust the fascist. If you say one more time, they are also corrupt, blah blah. Bro, none of that shit matters. It's about saving democracy. Keep in mind, this vote might as well be the last time we have a chance to vote. BJP has in its plan to change the constitution to install effective dictatorship. Please vote for the opposition. The opposition does its voice, you call them weak because the media won't relay their talking points. Before this govt came to power, majority of the screen time was given to opposition parties because they kept the current govt in check. Since the media is manipulated to their favor, how will people know? They are not weak. Save democracy, don't vote for BJP. You can vote with Aadhar these days. Best to vote for the least worst candidate, but yes if nota will make you register a vote then last resort vote nota. It's not just evil. India today is stuck in a battle between least evil and least stupid. Try voting for some small independent you want to encourage. Nota is a last last last resort as it's completely useless in result. Your small candidate won't win but they will at least be encouraged next time by ur vote. If I find a suitable candidate, most certainly. NOTA is my last choice when no sensible candidates appear! This is not the thread for this. Just go vote. BJP vote also fine. OP is a RaGa fan clearly but ignore that noise. Then stop fanboying over Rahul Gandhi in some threads and stick to your message. HEIN? Tag that comment link, right here right now. I would have causally said to vote for him which I have said at least thrice for BJP in this post only despite the fact this post would seem anti-BJP. I agreed with the people and suggested myself only to vote for the BJP if the candidate was deserving. Fanboying is something different, raising an opinion is different. Also, I can say whatever the fuck I want to. Abhi tak toh thoda bohot freedom of speech hai, wo toh use karne de. Do you know how nota works? If 100 ppl live in a constituency, and 97 vote NOTA and 2 vote for BJP and 1 Congress, then BJP wins. The 97% nota vote is just thrown out, no effects. Just urging you to do more research and pick a sensible candidate before declaring the absence of any. Who else should i vote? Rahul? That castiest galoot? Bjp? Religious fanatics? Commies? So No, ain't gonna bother with this shit anymore, better to just leave to more liberal nation. Say whatever the fuck you want dude I'm not criticizing you. Just pointing out that if you pick a side, you can't push a neutral message like \"everyone vote\" effectively. Just an opinion, take it or leave it. I most certainly do understand how NOTA works. My struggle here is a pipe dream, but I still dream, that one day, if an overwhelming majority does vote NOTA, even though the votes are discarded either: - The poltical parties will be inclined to field better candidates (atleast the losers if not the winners) - The matter can be taken up in court as a challenge against democratic values enshrined in the constitution. It is a slow, and mostly a losing battle. But a man can hope, and struggle I shall, to my dying breath Gyan kam chod, you came at me with an accusation, prove it. Whom should i vote then? Don't like any of the party Good, Dont vote, I am voting for BJP. How much more complacent can you get? Classic example of the reason why I.N.D.I.A will lose and NDA will win. you can hate NDA but did you ever see them saying \"If all Ram Bhakts vote for us, Congress will never get majority\"? No. They are already projected to win, yet they are coming in to places with no stake like Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala to impress on people. Stitching on coalitions to wiggle their way into most anti - BJP areas. The amount of ground work being done by their Karyakartas is just not comparable to opposition. For an outsider it will almost look like it's the BJP in opposition and INC in power just based on how their workers are scrambling with urgency. I am a Hindu. I completely hate the BJP for what they are trying to do to Hinduism. But Congress is promising to remove the 50% cap on reservations. What will happen to future generations of my family if they win. It's already so difficult to get a government job. It will be nearly impossible even if reservations increase by just 15%. Who should I support in this scenario, the one who is promising to hurt others or the one who is promising to hurt me? I choose to support neither and let the rest of the country decide. I also won't complain after the elections. Fair enough, right? There is a better way to exercise your hope is the point. Exercise by voting for some independent candidate who usually gets less votes. Or ideally vote for a least evil party. And even if they lose the winner will be more wary, thinking he has less votes so he needs to do more work to win next time. They'll need more than ousting the Gandhis to make some semblance of a comeback. They need to remove all the fossils too. I mean the leader of opposition is 81 years old. The part that I hate about the current situation, no government should feel they're invincible. When you don't have options, \"itne me intaich milega\" kicks in and then \"lena h to le wrna nikal\". When you do however have options, makes the other party think if I don't do shit there's an alternative right there that has potential to replace me. I will vote for this, I want my options. What if I vote BJP? I would like to vote for the opposition . Then I read their manifesto. No thank you . Probably nota for me Congress is fucked up. The only way they can revive is to do some drama and unceremoniously fire Rahul Gandhi before elections. People might get carried away with that and not vote for the BJP. But that won't happen. The interview I did went on-air on the radio. Don't have access to it anymore. Here's a more recent article by the Business Standard : [https://www.business-standard.com/elections/lok-sabha-election/nota-will-have-no-impact-on-election-results-without-right-to-reject-124030900287\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/elections/lok-sabha-election/nota-will-have-no-impact-on-election-results-without-right-to-reject-124030900287_1.html) You can find a lot more info online as well. Even though there have been elections where more people have voted NOTA instead of the candidates running, it is still a toothless option. It does not mean that the voter is rejecting the running candidates, but is simply seen as a choice not to vote. The system is working for those who are working it. They have no incentive to change it unless the people rise to the occasion. We outnumber these clowns who play to our biases and divide us, only to quietly use our hard-earned money to live the kind of life they do **not** deserve. We need to keep a fire constantly lit under their old, bloated asses if we want anything to get better. >Damn it must be sad to be so afraid of minorities everyday. Christian liberals from lebanon uses to say things just like this, they were the first ones to get butchered. >In what universe does a Hindutva party who runs parliament have less power, political reach, or cultural influence than Islamic extremists?

Our politics are way too infiltrated by the interests of the ruling class to have an easy fix. yeah because that's totally more humane than the singapore way It's an interesting read. I think you should post on this NOTA thing, I can also do but I need to do a little more research on this, let me know if you don't want to do it. I'll add it to my list of future posts. That still doesn't mean NOTA is a bad option. At the end of the day your vote is your expression. By this logic most of the people would end up voting for BJP because no one wants their vote to go waste. >I do not understand this brainwashing. Islamic terrorists are the worst thing that happened to muslims. Bjp and their hindu terrorism agenda is the greatest disaster to be inflicted on hinduism. Why would people like to promote extremism and terrorism in their own religion? I've seen hindus protesting against extremism in hindus. I have yet to see the other side. But i did see a lot of parachute and watermelon emojis and fireworks on 7/10 >... sadda kutta, kutta. twadda kutta tommy?! What superiority complex did I express? > yeah because that's totally more humane than the singapore way Is this sarcasm? What's the Singapore way? I thought you don't care about the humane way. All I want, no party should hold max to max 10 years. So I want to vote out this. If you want devlopement in country, just stop talking about religion and faith in media that's it. you'll rise. I'll do it once I'm done with work. This is not true. You have every right to expect from your city and country even if you don't vote. You are contributing to your society in different ways and are no different from someone who votes. You're talking about something which at least 50 years to happen (even the slightest noticeable change). You can't take religion out of India, it's the culture of India, a country with if not the oldest then one of the oldest histories and I'm saying this as an atheist. There would be a lot of gimmicks but there is a lot of hidden wisdom too. You will have to take out the evil forces who are using religion as a tool, the Hindutva version, where people do just anything hiding under the camouflage of Hinduism (the cultural aspect, not the religious aspect unless the peaceful version). Thanks a ton, mate, cheers. To whom should I vote? If not bjp then who? to that congress who will remove the limit for reservation, by which many general people will suffer for giving benefit to the people of lower caste who live in ac but say Want reservation? This is a F country with no future so don't vote anyone just let the F to happen and leave this country (only general people, because so called lower caste ka hi to desh h general Wale to Pakistani h) \"lower\" hmm Are Congress and BJP the only two parties in your constituency? Go through the list again, there might be candidates who are underrated. It might even be easier to contact them and have a chat with them. Listen to what they got to say. They don't have to win. Thats not the point at all. To everyone in the comments who see it as a choice between a rock and a piece of sh*t, it's not. We don't have a two-party system. Go through all candidates in your constituency. Especially the lesser known ones. Why are they even contesting? What's their story? Whats their manifesto? For how long they have been contesting and probably losing? All of this matters. Let's just open our minds and eyes to beyond INC and BJP and their regional dynastical counterparts. Jai hind! IKR, might take 100 too, India is on crash course of development basics are not clear... I only meant religion should be out from media not from culture, sooner as technologies rises India might be next china with no religion. 100 to 200 years If the IC is good, yes. Least evil is the stupidest concept imho. > This is why you pay attention in social science class. Take who to court? Which political party should go to jail or pay a file for not fielding a candidate the constituency did not like? It's a bollywood level idea and that's not a compliment. Use your vote in reality. The SC had already listed a PIL notifying EC to submit a response on why candidates should not be disqualified when NOTA is majority. Mayhaps, you shoudl have paid attention in social science classes as well. My friend if I give you gold for this comment. Anti defection laws negate this to a large extent. That only applies to people who vote for the winning party. If you vote for BJP for example and IF they win, then its kinda your fault for electing them. Not the fault of people who voted for others. Same applies to congress and other parties. ANYONE but nota. If 100,000 people vote NOTA and 2 people vote for BJP/Congress, then the BJP/Congress party would win. NOTA is useless in India, normally if the no-votes are above a certain percent it shows that theres no trust in the candidates and a re -election is done. But thats not the case so theres no point voting NOTA. I've a job 😅 Who told you China has religion abolished? It's just plain bullshit. There are proper temples and even churches in China. The Communist party is atheist, not the people. Tai Chi is part of religion only, just like we have Yoga. (even if it wasn't, we have associated it with religion now). 100, 200 or 500, you can't take religion out of India man, India won't survive without its ancient wisdom or roots in others words, I'll say it once again. My hate for Congress is much higher than my hate for BJP. I was never a BJP fan but are you seriously insinuating voting for Congress now that it's clear they hate the country and want to ruin it with their policies? In life, sports and any competitive arena, there will always be winners and losers.. winners know how to win and work towards it, losers find excuses… I have found that in order to be successful and happy in life, associate yourself with winners.. it will add optimism and happiness to your life… all the best I have been to china and I have researched about it too, mass majority people don't have religion and upcoming generation is absolutely none. Im talking about people mindset temple mosque etc will be there obviously... We too want a political party without religion, and teach people to keep religion at home and embrace the culture diversity. ain’t no way people ain’t clowning on this guy 💀 It is not about taking someone seriously… it’s about the right and need to vote..I am unaware about the origins of the post but am aware of the intent behind what I have said.. it’s a free country…u can think it’s propaganda if u want to.. but do u really think so?? I don't know why people are blaming Modi. The opposition is a bunch of jokers coming together just saying Modi Chor hai! You keep telling the public modi chor hai without credible proof that you are hurting your own campaign. Look at what prashant bhushan is one of the finest election strategists saying. Mr Gandhi lost an election from amethi. It was his proverbial backyard. People have rejected him. He screams cast in the 21st century, and he will give reservations. I feel bad for the INC ground staff. They have been let down significantly! You can rally as many people as you want to the booth. You have incompetent opposition that sums up the fate of the nation. Don't start with ED, CBI raids etc..let's not bring media rethoric here. While I support modi, I fear that the opposition is more to blame for not upping the game! BJP was this arrogant in 2004 and we know what happened there, result was almost -25% from their 1999 results. I agree with OP that everyone should vote. Yes, it is a collective effort assuming the process is fair (and I believe it is for most part, except some areas or booths) I disagree with OP on why you should vote. Don't vote out of hatred towards one party. Vote for what you belive is good for this country. I belive many voted against Congress in 2014 because they were fed up and because of all the corruption charges. Then BJP came. If you align with their idea, well and good. If not, and you vote against them, someone else with their own agenda and works hard for it, will come to power. Not necessarily someone you think is good for the country. So think well, understand the candidates and parties, understand their motives and agendas. Vote for what you align with the most. Election is just one part of democracy. The only statement that is correct is \"if one doesn't vote, he/she doesn't have a right to complain about the result.\" But he/she can rightfully complain about the state of city, state and country. Unfortunately, this is common the problem. Majority doesn't spend time thinking about whom to vote who will be deciding their future. :( How do we hold them accountable? How about voting for a person (instead of a party) from your local constituency? I will vote. I don't want to vote for BJP. But there is no viable option. BJP with all its issues is still better than the ineffective and spineless opposition. Bring me a better opposition and I'll flip my vote in a minute. Till then, don't harp about voting for Congress. In their current form, they don't deserve to win. Remove RaGa and open the leadership for all in Congress. Pure Gold Assuming you'll leave India to a better democracy, you'll have to wait a decade before you can even think of voting rights. You don't have to \"consider\" this for a long time brother practical or not. Iam planning to NOTA, or maybe go for a one day trip to somewhere that day. Proof has already been shared in the original link about communal violence rate. Go by stats not online narrative. I'm just fucking with you guys, man. I'm gonna vote. In fact, I'm leaving India for good right around elections but I'll make sure to vote out the fascists before I fly out. Istg if Congress had 2 braincells, it would've given up entirely on Sonia and Ragas baffoonery. If they had set up a new \"face of congress\" our opposition wouldn't have been such a joke. Shame. Those two brain cells are Sonia and Raga only. lol. They have suggested reservation based on census and percentage of population. If you are part of a group that is getting the benefit of government sponsored education and government jobs more than the percentage of your group and contribution reservation should equalise the opportunities for everyone. If you are afraid the people who will get reservation will get the opportunities that are reserved for them by population percentage and over that would also take up your common share by performing better, that is understandable, you would also need help to get your equal share of opportunities. No offence but based on what I’ve seen in past. The party who gets majority/highest no. of seats would pay and buy that guy. This right here. Parties pay attention to who votes and who doesn't. It doesn't matter who you support, BJP or not, parties only care about people who vote. If you and everyone votes, parties will have no excuse but to pay attention to your issues. Potentially including the party you didn't vote for. Mark my words that even after the remotest possibility, if that happens and congress wins, they’ll backtrack and make that clown PM. There are a number of ways, including protests, filing public interest litigations, spreading awareness via on ground and social media campaigns. Vote for him only if he truly works for his constituency. People should vote by their trust in their local representative, not by their party affiliation. Party will influence them obviously but those representatives can still safeguard local interests to some extent. Atleast the guy would have won then :P And that just proves we have options. You just made it a tad more expensive for the big fish. And in a small way made yourself heard. If he doesn't win and doesn't get bought, you still made yourself heard by reducing the vote share by might 1. 💐💐 Isn’t is prompting horse trading though? Also, this defeats the original purpose. Not actively. What's the original purpose again? Dhruv rathee asli ID se aao.. have a truly neutral and unbiased perspective bhai I also think that reducing their margin gives then fear of the populace. They might be frightened into doing less of their hindutva politics abd more actual work. And when someone asks who to vote for, tell them anyone except BJP and nota. Thats how you make yourself heard. Vote for the independent candidate no one has heard of. Vote for an actual person. Also, i am realising that even the modi is a good guy peeps hate amit shah. So point that every vote for modi is a vote for amit shah. TLDR: don’t just skip your vote because you think BJP will win. Go out and vote, it counts. W Voting for BJP and so are my friends. I'll make sure the 105 workers in my factory vote for BJP and so will 1000+ workers in factories owned by my friends. The majority of Redditors here are snowflakes who hardly leave their Tier 1 cities and live in rural India. Idhar aake dekho, bache kya, kutte kya buddhe kya, ghode kya...diwaren bhi modi modi kar rahe hai. The Vyapar mandal( trade union) has already announced that traders have to make sure their workers vote for BJP. 100000-200000 vote to humare chotte sheher se hi hogae. Aega to Modi ji 🙏🏽 Ok congress IT cell. Thanks for the info. First of all I'm not 18 yet , so I'm out Exactly. Problem is not BJP. Problem is weak opposition and with RaGa it has become non existent. OP is delusional af. Vote if you have believe that democracy can work Hahahaha What Ravish Kumar quoted can be quoted in reference of Bollywood too - \"Not all movies are done to get a hit movie, some movies are done just to make people from industry, media and audience to realize, that I am still active in the industry as an actor.\" Please don't vote then for the context : no party i.e. Congress (even in 1984) has got beyond 50%. In FPTP system you need to strategise the constituency wise (at which BJP is good at) that trying to win over all India as one entity. I know what Ravish Kumar posts is propaganda. What this kid posted is heavily influenced by it. Heck, we're all victims of propaganda. But those who're not even self-aware enough to realise it and still watch Ravish, I can't take their opinions seriously. Not to mention OP thinks sitting at home and masturbating is better than going to vote. Man could care less. Why are his opinions on this matter being taken seriously? Propaganda has become synonymous with modern society… the saying “jo deekhata hai vah bikata hai” has become the driving principle for political parties…I’m not saying I agree a 100% with OP(we can all have differences in opinion).. My intent to comment on the post was to present my views on the intent of casting ur vote and the privilege and power that comes with it…not to support or criticise someone’s perspective or ideology… I believe that everyone in entitled to their own opinion and all of them need not be mutually exclusive… TLDR- Vote For congress If BJP is going to win anyway, congress supporters need to be strategic and abstain or hold their noses and vote for BJP. Make them lax and lazy for the 2029 elections, they will assume they have a lot more support than they actually do. Bhai ye log tujhe ban kr denge subreddit se At this point anyone is better than BJP, even Raga Everything manmade is hackable and can be made to behave a certain way. You’ve convinced me buddy The local representative to elect is also a goon, what to do then?? I've cast my vote for various candidates throughout the years and it's only the half baked idiot who keeps winning. Karden Bhai...inki duniya yehi hai...real world mein fit nahi baith sakte...humare karne ko or paane ko bhot kuch hai...in snowflakes ke ban se mere kutte ki £hant tak ko farak nahi padhta. Inko ye tak nahi pata asli India kya hai or chalta kaise hai. BJP is just creating hype. In 2019 BJP got 37% votes. Electoral bond has exposed fake image that Modi is not corrupt. If even 5% out of those 37% realize that BJP is harmful for nation then result will change drastically. Don’t go by manifesto. Modi had promised 100 NEW smart cities in his manifesto in 2014. He was fully aware that it’s not possible. But still put it & voters thought that he will turn India into a developed nation in 5 years. Then he said 5 years is not sufficient, give me 10 years. Now he is saying give me time till 2047. He will most likely die before that & entire country will cry that India could not become developed country because Modi ji died. It was Congress which decreased unemployment, which reduced poverty. Congress developed entire IT industry which moved millions of middle class families to upper middle class. Really? If Congress hate country & want to ruin it, why it developed it in the first place 😀? There was no other party at that time to stop it. & I am quite sure that RaGa will not become PM if congress wins elections. He may opt to lead party while someone else becomes PM (the way MMS became PM). Gandhi family is not interested in power after death of Rajiv. They returned to politics for survival of Congress. Otherwise different factions will ruin their chances even further. It’s not just killings, it’s persecution of Muslims in other forms as well. Demolition of homes, boycott of business, attacking masjids etc etc. I am afraid at some point Muslims will lose patience (which BJP is targeting) & then it will be more violence in India. Like it or not bjp and RSS have slogged for at least 2 generations without any victory and they toil hard for every vote. I have a distant relative (now in late 70s) who worked for RSS all his life. Worked in a bank, had a very simple lifestyle decated his life to RSS with nothing in return. Neighbour got to know his stature when Mohan Bhagwat invited his family for lunch. A friend's friend who wanted modi to win in 2014 use to go to neighborhood after work and get form for voter registration filled. In week he use to get somewhere close to ~600-700 forms. Then on weekend go to the office, submit the forms, ensure the documentation is correct and get voter ids of these registered voters and distributed them on his own. Most of the times he used to get xerox of these forms because they were not available at the office. This he must have done for 3-4 months, spending his own money and time without anything in return. Ladies and Gentlemen this is what it takes to win an election. How? RaGa can't even put his thoughts in proper words. Always manages to make clown out of him. How can you visualize him in leading the country? And I am not being rude here, I am genuinely interested to know how is Raga better? Hey. Can we issue voter id online? That's what you are made to think. You are made to think Modi puts his thoughts very well, he also stutters, ofc when speaking without written speeches and teleprompter. In today's time, money can even make you think in a certain way about someone. >It’s not just killings, it’s persecution of Muslims in other forms as well. Demolition of homes, boycott of business, attacking masjids etc etc. How Confirmation bias works. Karnataka government came into power and a bomb blast happened. Is it supposed to mean Karnataka government is lax about security or it supports terrorism?. Recently two children were killed by slitting their throat. Now if the same had been done by a Hindu on someone from the minority community what would have been the reaction?. Just like how right wing groups exaggerate hindu issues, similarly is the same being done when it comes to Muslim issues. The demolition of homes is being done by specific government in cases that involve a crime. Targeting family for crimes of others is wrong but it's not blind action. Dispute over religious places is quite old, before the government used to suppress but BJP does nothing to suppress. Courts are being involved. Social media exaggerates everything e.g. the two UT cases where Muslims were asked to leave involved underage girls. And in the recent case those who came after 2000 were asked to leave but that does not get highlighted. Even if Hindus from other states try to reside en masse, these states local will have an issue, again this aspect does not get highlighted. >I am afraid at some point Muslims will lose patience (which BJP is targeting) & then it will be more violence in India. The problem of Muslims is not BJP but their own leaders, both politicians and religious leaders who misguide the Muslim community and target areas like higher education and jobs. There is a difference between stuttering and keep going lengths making nonsense statements like what raga does. No wonder social media and godi media gets lost of masala out of him. Unless congress gets away from gandhi family and thinks on a broader vision, I have to say that there is no hope for congress. I really wish that another party or person emerges that can really give tough competition to bjp. It doesn't matter when you rank AIR 2 and still can't get your dream branch in dream college! Op made some great points no matter who you'd like to see as our PM if you don't vote you're giving up, so go and vote even if you hate all options go and vote NOTA but go and vote Are to able to handle the evil. Because last time when MMS became the PM people said something similar. And if you are basing your opinion about oppositon's stupidity based on godi media claims then you are making a mistake. > Don't like any of the party You don't have to lke them, just maintain cordial relations. Actually average people rarely interact with the politicians. You just want the country and it's people to be in a better shape. If a Rank 2 doesn't get the dream then the college has only one seat? Similarly, VMMC Safdarjung College in Delhi has no seat for Dermatology for the general category. Good post! Nice to see India still has some sensible people! Exactly what OP wants to say lol Thats why china is leader in universe U do believe in shitty approaches and india will never become developed country. Simple example: gujarat is not getting projects just becoz its modis state. Corporates are not fools, they dont just start multi million projects just becoz its PMs state. They come to gujurat just becoz it has very stable govt. Very business friendly policies. They see the growth . Development on the price of Fascism maybe good for you not for us Sleep in poverty then Better than sleeping with a dead soul Cant argue with people who have no dream of living luxury and live the life of developed country. If u want to stay in proverty begging for food and thinking of how i will earn for my living, you are free to do that. Enjoy your billionaire life . Don't worry about me I dont even care about you. Enjoy ur poor life Then why giving lectures here Ambani ji. Enjoy your private Jet 😆 Irony is OP thinking if redditers go and vote congress will win lol Only reddit is only place where i saw there are many pro congress people. Reddit doesnt even resemble 5% of Indias population. So its does not matter Visit: [https://voters.eci.gov.in](https://voters.eci.gov.in) Additionally, reach out to any local party ground worker and ask them to help get your voter ID, just act like you'll vote for them and they'll escalate the process. Apply timely. Good luck. Good luck. I’ll try but I’m NRI. Steps mentioned here: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-elections-2024-how-can-nris-cast-vote-enroll-as-voters/articleshow/108648886.cms#](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-elections-2024-how-can-nris-cast-vote-enroll-as-voters/articleshow/108648886.cms#) We're talking about the present day. Try to keep up, although I understand that's hard to do with a room temp IQ I updated my answer to give details of development done by congress till 2014. & Congress would have developed India better from 2014 till today as well. US asked a lot of its businesses to move out of China. A major part of it would have come to India under a real democratic govt. But US businesses opted for many other countries & very small portion came to India. Nonsense statements like : cloud h..radar mein dikhega nhi..benefit le sakte hain Aaloo se sona nikalo(i hope u know who originally said these words) Few instances? It’s set pattern since many years. Every year sanghis will take out rallies in front of masjids & play abusive songs for hours. & when someone retaliate they start riots (& sometimes run away). Then police start demolition of homes of innocent Muslims in that area, whether they are involved or not. In Khandwa (MP) they demolished a home as illegal, which was built under govt scheme. They also demolished shop of a handicap person. This can’t be compared with individual personal crimes. They are being done by mobs & even govts. If govts don’t follow laws & constitution, how can someone expect others to follow it. Yes there have been incidents where they have tried to provoke which is wrong. But few instances does not mean that the entire picture is like that. Even I have faced one incident in Mumbai in the past during Ramzan where a Muslim guy was deliberately provoking us but that does not make me think all Muslims are like that. I can also provide you proof where riots were started by Muslims. Does that mean all Muslims are also like that? What about the two gruesome incidents, one beheading and other throat slitting of two children. If a Hindu had done so, there would have been a lot more made out of the situation. I am not from MP so I cannot verify or know about the demolition. They should be having enough seats. I feel you, if you were dreaming for Dematology and came across this. Are you wiling to state your benchmark so that someone else could see your perspective? Things I actually care about in order of priority, on my belief on how to make the nation progressive: - Education reforms/funding (100% public schooling ideal) - Investments in logistics/infrasture - Public discourse in policy making - More privatization with stringent regulation - Healthcare reforms/funding (100% public healthsector ideal) - Simplified and reduced (specially indirect) taxation - Separation of church and state - Strengthen controls for accountability - Increase in judicial/administrative hiring - Police reforms > Recently two children were killed by slitting their throat. Now if the same had been done by a Hindu on someone from the minority community what would have been the reaction?. are you seriously so brain-washed. it's unbelievable the mental gymnastics of the chaddi Nope, I deal with realism not idealism. Can you also post the context in which it was asked?. The world is exaggerating every move, if something like that had happened, it would have been a poster incident to prove the divisivness spread by BJP just like how I see now people using this incident being used by right wing groups for Islamophobia. weak minded people like you can't see that IT cell is searching high and low for cases like the 2 children. there was another case in Prayagraj where 2 kids were beaten to death yesterday. that doesn't matter to you one bit. the govt is literally using ED to extort companies lol. >Nope, I deal with realism not idealism. >Can you also post the context in which it was asked?. wtf are you talking abt Opposition getting a taste of their own medicine, something they have been doing for so many years. ED is only related to economic offences, if you have not done wrong you can get away but CBI used to deal with crimes, which is more heinous. You changed your comment after my answer. so you have no actual morals or principles I am not an idealist but a realist. Nota is useless and I have to choose between the two. The facts clearly direct towards Modi. The efficiency at which they are developing infrastructure would take the same to be done in 10-15 yrs minimum by Congress if not more. > Education reforms/funding (100% public schooling ideal) [Manish Sisodia architect of education revolution in Delhi, ‘demonic forces’ sent him behind bars: Kejriwal](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/manish-sisodia-delhi-education-revolution-architect-arvind-kejriwal-8545541/) > “Today, children from government schools in Delhi are getting admission in IITs and clearing the all-India medical exam. This is a sea change, a revolution. Delhi has witnessed a revolution in education over the last 8 years; there is only one person behind this revolution — Manish Sisodia,” > Public discourse in policy making Even the elected representatives are not allowed to speak in parliament. > More privatization with stringent regulation Legalizing bribery(Electoral Bonds) and providing secrecy and protection by Law > Separation of church and state You must be joking? Just a few points, look beyond what godi media and state controlled meida channels are ishowing you. I never claimed at BJP or INC or AAP is doing any of this. You asked for my benchmark, and thus here it is. No current party or candicate currently satisifed this spec Those who are advocating about the results of the current party, I would like to tell them that This election is not about development anymore. It's for stopping the making of another Indira Gandhi so that in 2029 too elections occur and in a fair and transparent manner else you now know. All or nothing policy doesn't create any change, infact it amounts to negligence that lets a bad situation become worse. Choose anti-incumbency, that is the lesser of evils available. Democracy is slow and messy. Phir se lesser evil. Doesn't look like you had any interest in evaluating benchmark to see my perspective. I can leverage the same logic to vote NOTA (which I am going to) Also, by lesser evil logic, BJP/AAP satisfies this benchmark far better than INC. Stop shilling for a party if you're not interested in a logical discourse. > Stop shilling for a party if you're not interested in a logical discourse. I am not about discourse but about betterment of the country. If you are happy with your state of your mind and thestate of country, then I am happy for you. And my firm believe is, that mass voting NOTA is the only way to protest, nay revolt against the stagnant state of our nation and the parties that represent it. A massive support for NOTA (50% +) will both send a strong signal to the electees/candidates and be leveraged in the courts to provide more power to the the option, and thus the electorate. I got your perspective and didn't agree with it's results. Because protest works for those who have conscience and empathy. Look at all the protests and how easily they are being ignored. Be it Manipur burning, farmers, Ladakh people,.... **Manipur is still burning**: which should make you realize that they just want to stay in power. If it had been non-BJP in power, President's rule would have been established long ago. And you think 50%+ Nota is a strong signal? Remember the smoke bombs in parliament, right on the anniversary of Parliament attack? I have voted for over 20 years now. And there is some variation of the same shit no matter who is in power. Which is why I do not believe in any of the current parties for the most part. I remember a million things that happened under INC too. A million things that happened under SP/TMC/RJD/JD etc etc including experiencing some of these first hand. So yes, NOTA is the best signal at this point. > So yes, NOTA is the best signal at this point. Yes, a signal of learned helplessness. LOL I am sure you'd have the same view when Satyagraha was attempted. Don't bother protesting, Just be comfortable in the filth that Indian politics is. > Don't bother protesting, Just be comfortable in the filth that Indian politics is. That's democracy, if you believe that NOTA will bring in the improvments then go ahead. I am ok even with minor improvements, e.g. lesser evil. Dude BJP is the lesser of the two evils for us...why don't people get it?? I am not from any upper caste nor I am in any category, so the only hope that now that there's some jobs that remain for us, I need to think of voting for BJP... There is no left alliance left to support, it's as good as dead, and the rest are a bunch of independents who are totally unreliable, so the only viable option is the BJP... Couldn't have put it in anyway better, here's an ice cream for you 🍨🍧 > I am not from any upper caste nor I am in any category, so the only hope that now that there's some jobs that remain for us, How many jobs were created in last 10yrs? Only the rich got richer and as per Bihar caste census only 15% are open category. So if you are in the <8lpa you should be getting benefits already with 10% reservation. And if you are well off then there in no need for reservations. Somebody had posted a [side by side comparision of BJP and Congress manifesto](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bdz8Ee7B96aO36pP5_cZpe47PBkCDDc/view).

So that is just Bihar, doesn't get you the central government, I am in an open category where I am not getting 10% reservations but still reservations matter and there are many more like me... My family income should be basis of a scholarship not for merit, why would it mean that reservations don't matter? I also want the jobs, but for all, not just for one category, look at the recent news, there were postings in Bihar were not even a single position was for the open category, so where should we go?

Did Modi/BJP/RSS create the jobs that they promised? > \"And what about the 2 crore jobs a year that Modiji promised!\" the former Union minister said. So your solution to that problem is to elect a 5th-6th generation nepotist who lacks the guts to defend his home bastion against a guy who is literally bringing in foreign investment and jobs in the country?
