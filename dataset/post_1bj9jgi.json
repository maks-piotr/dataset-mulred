        "Poor CEOs doing the work of 885 workers.",
        "I mean, the CEO is one guy. These companies hire tens of thousands of freshers. Let's say even if they hire only 1000 people per year, doubling the salary from 4 lakh to 8 lakh is an added cost of 40 crore rupees.\n\nAlso CEO talent is hard to get and retain, while freshers are high in supply.\n\nI'm not defending their decision, I'm just saying that's just how modern economies work.",
        "The value is produced by the work of employees on all levels, while the CEO, the \"one guy\" keeps all the profits? That seems more exploitation than economics. Employees are under compensated not because of supply and demand, just plain greed.",
        "I have worked as a fresher with one of the companies listed, let's just say even 3.1L is too much. That's the condition of graduates today",
        "Multiples of 1000 workers",
        "Pls clarify how it's not invisible hand of free markets at play but greed.",
        "And employees taking risks with their own capital?",
        "I feel for the HCL's CEO stagnation",
        "What about working hours 40 to 70 ?",
        "It's is a capitalist boogyman. The only free market is your wages and living conditions. They have targets for profits. All ideas is worthless without execution, employees execut it.",
        "The only risk companies take is not becoming who they employ.",
        "What are you gonna do now, Median guy?",
        "No, must go back to Hindu-Muslim chutiyap. Those are the real issues afterall/s",
        "what the actual f\\*\\*??",
        "Now show the CEO pay increases",
        "Any execution is worthless without capital. And there'll be no capital without profits.",
        "The companies are totally doing people a favor. Yep.",
        "Ahh so they should do charity, I see.",
        "No just pay fair. A CEO doesn't produce the value for which they are paid.",
        "Pay fair? How do you determine what's fair? I'd say what they are paying is fair. Someone else will say 1L is fair, and a third person might say 10L is fair. \n\nA CEO doesn't produce value? BOD would have sacked him from shareholder pressure if he weren't creating more value than their pay.",
        "Freshers don’t have grandkids to give those crores to, so why do they need the money?",
        "My God! HCL is horrendous!",
        "Some would also say slaves are fair. Salaries and policies should be determined democratically.\n\nA CEO doesn't produce value for what they are paid, the useless board shareholders too are overpaid.",
        "Might sound offensive but if you're a fresher and get placed in one of these companies then you deserve this tbh.",
        "Sucks but why blame them? As long as there's an endless supply of graduates willing to work for that amount, that's what the companies will pay.",
        "lol. We have been non-capitalist country for almost 50 years. You can go review what qol was like the .\n\nAs far as CEO’s making insane multiples of what freshers make, the utility in the market is locked up in the marginal value. And if you can attract a slightly better person for a given job that makes all the difference.",
        "Yeah, some would say slaves are fair- your point?  \n  \nDemocratically lol. Might as well have a vote for every other small thing. \n\nAlso, the shareholders don't receive a salary. And, the BoD and the CEO would be sacked if shareholders didn't see value in them. They are not sacked, proving they generate value far more than their salaries.",
        "Now compare how many people are employed by these companies in 2012 vs 2022. \n\nI do agree the entry level salaries are stagnated but obviously the company value and size also increase multifold so it ceo salaries make sense.\n\nBut in the end total number of employed people has increase, even if their salaries are now low, this provides them with opportunity to gain hand-on experience and upskill, to switch to a better job.\n\nSo even though capitalism promotes wealth divide, it is the best system we have for poor countries IMO.",
        "What's the alternative ? A cap on executive pay ? No exective would sign on to any Indian company, keep in mind most CEO of IT firms spend half their time in US and other key markets. \n\nEvery single fresher is making at least 2X of per capita income, as far as goverment is concerned the freshers are richer than most Indians and they are correct.",
        "Why are you getting so worked up? That too for such bs wealth inequalities when CEO themselves don't work the amount to produce that number. They are just encashing what work employees produce.\n\nYes, democratically among the people in the company. It's not that difficult.\n\nAso I hope you're not saying slaves are good. That's messed up, I hope you don't employ anyone.",
        "With how deskilled most fresh graduates are, especially the ones that land jobs at mass hirers like the ones listed, I’m not very surprised.",
        "Agreed.",
        "Are you, by any chance, a fresher at any of these companies?",
        "Best system to enable exploitation in poorer countries.",
        "I didn't notice they had shown the CEO pay increases my bad☠️",
        "The CEO pay has increased because these companies have moved away from promoter/founder CEOs to Professional CEOs who of course want to be paid more.",
        "What the hell do you mean by \"risk\"? I take risk all the time but am still poor.",
        "Bhai then whats the better alternative this is the only model that works",
        "How will you pay the CEO if you only work 40 hours?",
        "Post this on Developers India sub and see how they defend their masters. Even a single government interference will make their blood boil.",
        ">You can go review what qol was like the .\n\nBasic necessities, even land was affordable. Same in the USA. What qol are you talking about today?",
        "> Yeah, some would say slaves are fair- your point?\n\nMy point is slavery is not fair -\\_-",
        "Why do you have a problem with democratising corporations?",
        "What basic necessities??? You couldn’t get telephones, essential medicines, scooters, or even jobs. \n\nSure if you wanted to continue life as it was in the Middle Ages, then “basic necessities” were available.",
        "I can't find the median on internet 😛",
        "🧑‍💻: They will leave us and set up shop in another 3rd world country, must keep quite and obey.",
        "Ex-CEO here.\n\nAnnual compensation of a CEO often includes stocks, and the stock prices have changed drastically in last 10 years.",
        "Bhai , 6 mahino ke liye mujhe CEO bana do , fir main retire ho jaunga🤓",
        "Bruh we are in 2024 and ppl are still sad over 2022 compensations. Check out the public filings and see the current salaries.",
        ">So even though capitalism promotes wealth divide, it is the best system we have for poor countries IMO.\n\n🤡",
        "There's a working secret system, but capitalists are always trying to hide and suppress it because they would lose control over people's lives - >!SOCIALISM!<",
        "Look at India's economic growth before and after economic reforms and china growth when they opened their markets. \n\nIf that is what exploitation looks like I want more of that.",
        "Am I missing the sarcasm or is this serious?",
        "Am I missing the sarcasm or is this serious?",
        "Liberalization also bought us - weakened labor laws, bending laws for corporates, paying less for the same work valued much more (just cause you're from a poorer place, aka exploitation), an added bonus of environmental issues that comes with it, and \"monetization\" of a lot of public assets to individuals. Calling it a good thing is right, if you can completely ignore the massive wealth inequality it produced. \n\n\"I want more of that, as I'm on the privileged side of the wealth divide.\"",
        "On first glance I was like \"woah Infosys CEO salary hasn't increased at all in 10 years\". Then I realized it went from 80 LAKH to CRORES. 💀",
        "If employee family falls sick, who gets fired? Employee. If company financials fall sick, who gets fired? Employee. Under all conditions, the risk is the employee's. If business owner's business fails, what does he do? Finds a job and becomes employee. So worst case scenario for business owner is best case scenario for employee. Clearly the risk is employee's",
        "He is feeling the same pain 24 year olds face after not getting placement",
        "Silly argument. If a business makes a loss, the owners take no profit, but the employees are paid irrespective. Also, applying the same logic - if an employee is kicked, he can find a new job. So, his worst-case scenario is a job change, while the owner's is a capital loss.",
        "Huh? People already have a say in the workplace because they can freely choose where to work.",
        "You take risk in the form of potential capital loss that you invested in the business?",
        "Capitalism is still the closest thing we have to meritocracy. CEOs and Freshers are fired all the time when they make wrong decisions (Adam Neuman, Ashneer Grover, and Sam Altman). But no economist will ever say trickle down economy works. Direct incentives to companies to invest in R&D and manufacturing is more efficient than trickle down economy. Also, Market capitalization is not equal to revenue. Market capitalization just means the product of number of stocks a company has and value of each stock. It means zilch since stock prices goes up and down as per market's sentiment and herd mentality (both can be persuaded for good and bad reasons). I think a more appropriate table would be with columns: ceo earning, fresher earning, number of freshers employed in that period, company's revenue, and company's profit. That will provide a better picture.",
        "I have seen employees not getting paid coz economy is slow, so even employees lose money for their work if there's a loss. CEO also takes salary irrespective, what he doesn't get is appreciation of his stock.\n\n\nAbout the job change part, so still, he has to face the same problems the owner faces and more.",
        "That's not democracy. That's what separates capitalism from slavery.",
        "CEO is not always the owner though?",
        "It’s not about how hard you work, it’s about how replaceable you are. If you can earn your company hundreds of millions more than the other candidates, they are happy to pay you tens of millions regardless of how hard you work. If you work super hard but it’s just like cleaning toilets or something anyone can do, you are very replaceable so you can’t really negotiate for a higher wage.",
        "What would be the breakdown between actual cash salary and stock compensation? CXO level and senior management get a sizeable component of their income as stock",
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0dGNDJqUM4&t=264s\n\nReason we have billionaires and high CEO salaries  is shareholder benefit is given priority for a company above anything else. In this employees are the first target(Layoff/Low Salary), cutting corners(current favorite example is Boeing). Company long term survival is immaterial as long as short term share holder profit is achieved. Board tied CEO compensation to stock value , thus encouraging CEO's to take decisions which bolster the stock value and not the company's long terms best interests. Most high CEO salaries have substantial stock component.\n\nThis video shows how till 80's /early 90's American's had decent salaries and faced very little layoffs. All of this changed when Milton Friedman proposed the shareholder supremacy theory and Jack Welch implemented it at GE.This system is now implemented world wide.",
        "But bro, if I don't let rich billionaires drown in money while I myself struggle to save 2-4 thousands every month, how will the country survive?",
        "Read up 🤡",
        "240 hour work week!",
        "How would I take that risk? I don't have any capital, also what exactly that I do with the capital count as \"risk\"?",
        "If the average inflation was 6% during these years, can I assume that inflation adjusted pay from 2012 to 2022 should be 2012 x (1.06)^10?\n(1.06)^10 is 1.79, does that mean if the percentage increase isn't 79%, they're getting paid less than what they were in 2012?",
        "come from your real account mr 70 hr murthy",
        "> We have been non-capitalist country for almost 50 years. \n\nso tatas, ambanis and other business houses that existed in last 50 years are non-capitalist according to your logic?",
        "It’s basic demand and supply.\nAlso, companies have to train a lot of employees during the probation.\nAdditional cost to loyalty ratio as well.\n\nAlthough, I am in favor of increased wages for students and qualified workers irrespective of their college tier.",
        "Are you seriously defending this crap? How exactly is a CEO alone earning the company hundreds of millions? The wages of 2012 for a CEO is more than fair for the value they provide and the work they actually do.",
        "As a shareholder of most of the above companies listed, I wholeheartedly disagree with you. You should take a look at the current market cap of these companies before comparing wages of 2012 with present wages. The work that they do is reflected in the chart of their company's stock price. \n\nA good CEO can determine literally billions in value annually for a company. Why aren't they worth that much?\n\nLet's use an example: Jamie Dimon. He turned Commercial credit, a failing company, into Citigroup, worth $113 billion when he left. Citi has since declined in market cap to $80 billion today. When he left Citi, he eventually ended up as CEO of JPMorgan in 2005, then worth $138 billion. It's now worth $430 billion.\n\nWhat would you pay a guy who can take your failing company and make it into the industry leader, creating $100s of billions in value for you? You and a rival are competing to hire the next Jamie Dimon of your industry. Are you going to refuse to pay more than 'a few million dollars' out of principle and lose ~$300 billion in value over the next 20 years?",
        "Currently, a CEO alone or maybe a few board members takes decisions, that's their job, also it doesn't necessarily mean all decisions they take are good. When the decisions are bad you have layoffs and pay cuts only for the employees, not the management to preserve profits.\n\nSimilarly, it's the job of employees to act on those decisions and make it a reality. Now, when the value is generated, it only goes proportionally to the CEO and market cap, value, etc. doesn't apply even a bit to the employee's pay.\n\nYou conveniently choose not to see the exploitation here and assume you'll find someone cheaper and more desperate to do that work, that's the root and rot of all problems.\n\nCEOs are overpaid. Period.",
        "> Sucks but why blame them?\n\nJust like as long as people have valuables thiefs are going to steal, why blame them? Why should we have law and order? Why should there be regulations?",
        "Lmao. If what these graduates are bringing to the table is so valuable, why isn't anyone else paying them more?\n\nAnyway, go lobby for regulations if you must. That's a completely valid take.",
        "Spot on.",
        "again a gujju defending overpaid capitalists and shady business lol",
        "Sure, people can choose to work freely. How about letting those free workers give their opinions on wages, management decisions, etc. \nDemocracy is not just about being free to choose to work.",
        "Yeah they can't even afford food and rent, they will die and thus have no children to pass on the money to.\n\n\nWhere's the problem?",
        "Lol yes, those guys are just full of crap",
        "1000 hour work week butter",
        "Yeah, it was just imports that were restricted",
        "\"Economic growth\" doesn't mean crap if it only benefits the rich. All these numbers mean is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.",
        "Yeah, this exactly. I worked as a software developer, earned a lot of money, and I still think this system it's bad. Make me the richest man in the country and I will still call this system bad.",
        "No problem, we'll replace the useless CEO with AI. ChatGPT will provide.",
        "You don't even need socialism, what you need is proper labour laws and enforcement. We don't have proper enforcement of any law.",
        "There's no such thing as ethical capitalism, doing anything to regulate is against their interests. They will lobby against it or blackmail you with setting shop in another 3rd world country, that was again historically exploited by capitalists. A system that eats itself.\n\nI'm turned full blown socialist after seeing this bs.",
        "Socialism can also be bad when corruption and greed are involved.\n\n\nThere is no perfect economic system, greed and corruption are the main enemy.",
        "Yes checks and balances are needed everywhere. If you think about it, corruption and greed is a product of inequality and both are heavily amplified under capitalism or it's earlier form feudalism because that's how you enable people to buy more = profits, have people to work, and corruption because of taking advantage of power hierarchies.\n\nSocialism is a fundamentally good way. The end goal is people collectively doing things, according to everyone's needs. It's already happening but all profits of work go to a few individuals.",
        "Capitalism does work OP.",
        "What shady business are we talking about here? These are public companies. What is it that you know that other investors don't?",
        "Underpaying employees is the shady business.",
        "Ever heard of supply and demand?",
        "> why isn't anyone else paying them more?\n\nLobby or cartel comes to mind. If they are not bringing any value why hire them? rhetorical question.",
        "You're comparing two different things. Capitalism and slavery are not mutually exclusive. Capitalism, as an economic system, can coexist with various forms of labor arrangements, including slavery.",
        "Democracy in the workplace, beyond basic labour laws and regulations, would be a recipe for chaos and inefficiency. Businesses are designed for productivity and profitability. Employees are free to seek employment elsewhere if they disagree with management decisions. And those who seek a democratic workplace should start their own business or join a worker-owned cooperative.",
        "You start a business and have your own or 'outside' capital. The strategic decisions you make for the business determine the profitability and, therefore, the risk of capital. If you make bad decisions and provide no return on capital, the company could be dragged to courts, and with it, your net worth collapses, among other things. Example - SBF.",
        "I don't have my own capital or \"outside\" capital, I probably won't get \"outside\" capital even if I tried to. I am not educated, I don't know anything about capital or business or investment I can't ask anyone for advise or learn about it or go to college because I am from a rural village and a son of a small peasant worker. I am perfectly willing to take the action of \"risk\" if that would make me rich now tell me how do this \"risk\" thing and become rich? please tell me I just want to be rich and that all",
        "You start a business and take loan until you can get outside capital.",
        "By defining all odds I was somehow able to get a loan. I start a business and took the action of \"risk\" but the business failed I now owe money to the bank. Tell, why didn't I become rich even after taking \"risk\"?",
        "Because you took bad decisions since your business failed. You took ‘risk’ and failed. That’s why it’s difficult to scale business and turn them profitable. And who do become rich.",
        "How does this \"good\" decisions work? how do I take \"good\" decisions?",
        "By not taking bad decisions.",
        "How do I avoid taking \"bad\" decisions?",
        "Read? Learn? Experience?",
        "How would I learn? I can't afford college, I can't afford to go to the city, I can't consult with any businessmen or entrepreneurs. I obviously can't afford to have experience since I can't play the game in the first place.",
        "Public schools don’t require money and have scholarships. And who said you need formal education for business? You don’t need to consult if you’ve conviction. Where there is a will there is a way.",
        "Alright, I went to public school. I have the conviction, I have the will. Do you I want to be poor? Do you think I like being poor? I have the will, I desperately want to become rich. You say I don't need any formal education, So now that I have everything I need, I invested in nvidia but the stock price went down and I still haven't become rich.",
        "As I said, just because you took risk doesn’t mean you’ll be rewarded. That’s why it’s called ‘risk’. \nFor Nvidia, maybe you invested at a high PE or have too short time-frame for your investment thesis to be realised.",
        ">For Nvidia, maybe you invested at a high PE or have too short time-frame for your investment thesis to be realised.\n\nWell I didn't know any of that before since I haven't studied anything or have any experience in it or some thing else.

    "light_cleaned_title": "But Capitalism and trickle down economics work!",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "The audacity of these people to say this is a merit based system is just unbelievable!",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Poor CEOs doing the work of 885 workers. I mean, the CEO is one guy. These companies hire tens of thousands of freshers. Let's say even if they hire only 1000 people per year, doubling the salary from 4 lakh to 8 lakh is an added cost of 40 crore rupees. Also CEO talent is hard to get and retain, while freshers are high in supply. I'm not defending their decision, I'm just saying that's just how modern economies work. The value is produced by the work of employees on all levels, while the CEO, the \"one guy\" keeps all the profits? That seems more exploitation than economics. Employees are under compensated not because of supply and demand, just plain greed. I have worked as a fresher with one of the companies listed, let's just say even 3.1L is too much. That's the condition of graduates today Multiples of 1000 workers Pls clarify how it's not invisible hand of free markets at play but greed. And employees taking risks with their own capital? I feel for the HCL's CEO stagnation What about working hours 40 to 70 ? It's is a capitalist boogyman. The only free market is your wages and living conditions. They have targets for profits. All ideas is worthless without execution, employees execut it. The only risk companies take is not becoming who they employ. What are you gonna do now, Median guy? No, must go back to Hindu-Muslim chutiyap. Those are the real issues afterall/s what the actual f\\*\\*?? Now show the CEO pay increases Any execution is worthless without capital. And there'll be no capital without profits. The companies are totally doing people a favor. Yep. Ahh so they should do charity, I see. No just pay fair. A CEO doesn't produce the value for which they are paid. Pay fair? How do you determine what's fair? I'd say what they are paying is fair. Someone else will say 1L is fair, and a third person might say 10L is fair. A CEO doesn't produce value? BOD would have sacked him from shareholder pressure if he weren't creating more value than their pay. Freshers don’t have grandkids to give those crores to, so why do they need the money? My God! HCL is horrendous! Some would also say slaves are fair. Salaries and policies should be determined democratically. A CEO doesn't produce value for what they are paid, the useless board shareholders too are overpaid. Might sound offensive but if you're a fresher and get placed in one of these companies then you deserve this tbh. Sucks but why blame them? As long as there's an endless supply of graduates willing to work for that amount, that's what the companies will pay. lol. We have been non-capitalist country for almost 50 years. You can go review what qol was like the . As far as CEO’s making insane multiples of what freshers make, the utility in the market is locked up in the marginal value. And if you can attract a slightly better person for a given job that makes all the difference. Yeah, some would say slaves are fair- your point? Democratically lol. Might as well have a vote for every other small thing. Also, the shareholders don't receive a salary. And, the BoD and the CEO would be sacked if shareholders didn't see value in them. They are not sacked, proving they generate value far more than their salaries. Now compare how many people are employed by these companies in 2012 vs 2022. I do agree the entry level salaries are stagnated but obviously the company value and size also increase multifold so it ceo salaries make sense. But in the end total number of employed people has increase, even if their salaries are now low, this provides them with opportunity to gain hand-on experience and upskill, to switch to a better job. So even though capitalism promotes wealth divide, it is the best system we have for poor countries IMO. What's the alternative ? A cap on executive pay ? No exective would sign on to any Indian company, keep in mind most CEO of IT firms spend half their time in US and other key markets. Every single fresher is making at least 2X of per capita income, as far as goverment is concerned the freshers are richer than most Indians and they are correct. Why are you getting so worked up? That too for such bs wealth inequalities when CEO themselves don't work the amount to produce that number. They are just encashing what work employees produce. Yes, democratically among the people in the company. It's not that difficult. Aso I hope you're not saying slaves are good. That's messed up, I hope you don't employ anyone. With how deskilled most fresh graduates are, especially the ones that land jobs at mass hirers like the ones listed, I’m not very surprised. Agreed. Are you, by any chance, a fresher at any of these companies? Best system to enable exploitation in poorer countries. I didn't notice they had shown the CEO pay increases my bad☠️ The CEO pay has increased because these companies have moved away from promoter/founder CEOs to Professional CEOs who of course want to be paid more. What the hell do you mean by \"risk\"? I take risk all the time but am still poor. Bhai then whats the better alternative this is the only model that works How will you pay the CEO if you only work 40 hours? Post this on Developers India sub and see how they defend their masters. Even a single government interference will make their blood boil. >You can go review what qol was like the . Basic necessities, even land was affordable. Same in the USA. What qol are you talking about today? > Yeah, some would say slaves are fair- your point? My point is slavery is not fair -\\_- Why do you have a problem with democratising corporations? What basic necessities??? You couldn’t get telephones, essential medicines, scooters, or even jobs. Sure if you wanted to continue life as it was in the Middle Ages, then “basic necessities” were available. I can't find the median on internet 😛 🧑‍💻: They will leave us and set up shop in another 3rd world country, must keep quite and obey. Ex-CEO here. Annual compensation of a CEO often includes stocks, and the stock prices have changed drastically in last 10 years. Bhai , 6 mahino ke liye mujhe CEO bana do , fir main retire ho jaunga🤓 Bruh we are in 2024 and ppl are still sad over 2022 compensations. Check out the public filings and see the current salaries. >So even though capitalism promotes wealth divide, it is the best system we have for poor countries IMO. 🤡 There's a working secret system, but capitalists are always trying to hide and suppress it because they would lose control over people's lives - >!SOCIALISM!< Look at India's economic growth before and after economic reforms and china growth when they opened their markets. If that is what exploitation looks like I want more of that. Am I missing the sarcasm or is this serious? Am I missing the sarcasm or is this serious? Liberalization also bought us - weakened labor laws, bending laws for corporates, paying less for the same work valued much more (just cause you're from a poorer place, aka exploitation), an added bonus of environmental issues that comes with it, and \"monetization\" of a lot of public assets to individuals. Calling it a good thing is right, if you can completely ignore the massive wealth inequality it produced. \"I want more of that, as I'm on the privileged side of the wealth divide.\" On first glance I was like \"woah Infosys CEO salary hasn't increased at all in 10 years\". Then I realized it went from 80 LAKH to CRORES. 💀 If employee family falls sick, who gets fired? Employee. If company financials fall sick, who gets fired? Employee. Under all conditions, the risk is the employee's. If business owner's business fails, what does he do? Finds a job and becomes employee. So worst case scenario for business owner is best case scenario for employee. Clearly the risk is employee's He is feeling the same pain 24 year olds face after not getting placement Silly argument. If a business makes a loss, the owners take no profit, but the employees are paid irrespective. Also, applying the same logic - if an employee is kicked, he can find a new job. So, his worst-case scenario is a job change, while the owner's is a capital loss. Huh? People already have a say in the workplace because they can freely choose where to work. You take risk in the form of potential capital loss that you invested in the business? Capitalism is still the closest thing we have to meritocracy. CEOs and Freshers are fired all the time when they make wrong decisions (Adam Neuman, Ashneer Grover, and Sam Altman). But no economist will ever say trickle down economy works. Direct incentives to companies to invest in R&D and manufacturing is more efficient than trickle down economy. Also, Market capitalization is not equal to revenue. Market capitalization just means the product of number of stocks a company has and value of each stock. It means zilch since stock prices goes up and down as per market's sentiment and herd mentality (both can be persuaded for good and bad reasons). I think a more appropriate table would be with columns: ceo earning, fresher earning, number of freshers employed in that period, company's revenue, and company's profit. That will provide a better picture. I have seen employees not getting paid coz economy is slow, so even employees lose money for their work if there's a loss. CEO also takes salary irrespective, what he doesn't get is appreciation of his stock. About the job change part, so still, he has to face the same problems the owner faces and more. That's not democracy. That's what separates capitalism from slavery. CEO is not always the owner though? It’s not about how hard you work, it’s about how replaceable you are. If you can earn your company hundreds of millions more than the other candidates, they are happy to pay you tens of millions regardless of how hard you work. If you work super hard but it’s just like cleaning toilets or something anyone can do, you are very replaceable so you can’t really negotiate for a higher wage. What would be the breakdown between actual cash salary and stock compensation? CXO level and senior management get a sizeable component of their income as stock Reason we have billionaires and high CEO salaries is shareholder benefit is given priority for a company above anything else. In this employees are the first target(Layoff/Low Salary), cutting corners(current favorite example is Boeing). Company long term survival is immaterial as long as short term share holder profit is achieved. Board tied CEO compensation to stock value , thus encouraging CEO's to take decisions which bolster the stock value and not the company's long terms best interests. Most high CEO salaries have substantial stock component. This video shows how till 80's /early 90's American's had decent salaries and faced very little layoffs. All of this changed when Milton Friedman proposed the shareholder supremacy theory and Jack Welch implemented it at GE.This system is now implemented world wide. But bro, if I don't let rich billionaires drown in money while I myself struggle to save 2-4 thousands every month, how will the country survive? Read up 🤡 240 hour work week! How would I take that risk? I don't have any capital, also what exactly that I do with the capital count as \"risk\"? If the average inflation was 6% during these years, can I assume that inflation adjusted pay from 2012 to 2022 should be 2012 x (1.06)^10? (1.06)^10 is 1.79, does that mean if the percentage increase isn't 79%, they're getting paid less than what they were in 2012? come from your real account mr 70 hr murthy > We have been non-capitalist country for almost 50 years. so tatas, ambanis and other business houses that existed in last 50 years are non-capitalist according to your logic? It’s basic demand and supply. Also, companies have to train a lot of employees during the probation. Additional cost to loyalty ratio as well. Although, I am in favor of increased wages for students and qualified workers irrespective of their college tier. Are you seriously defending this crap? How exactly is a CEO alone earning the company hundreds of millions? The wages of 2012 for a CEO is more than fair for the value they provide and the work they actually do. As a shareholder of most of the above companies listed, I wholeheartedly disagree with you. You should take a look at the current market cap of these companies before comparing wages of 2012 with present wages. The work that they do is reflected in the chart of their company's stock price. A good CEO can determine literally billions in value annually for a company. Why aren't they worth that much? Let's use an example: Jamie Dimon. He turned Commercial credit, a failing company, into Citigroup, worth $113 billion when he left. Citi has since declined in market cap to $80 billion today. When he left Citi, he eventually ended up as CEO of JPMorgan in 2005, then worth $138 billion. It's now worth $430 billion. What would you pay a guy who can take your failing company and make it into the industry leader, creating $100s of billions in value for you? You and a rival are competing to hire the next Jamie Dimon of your industry. Are you going to refuse to pay more than 'a few million dollars' out of principle and lose ~$300 billion in value over the next 20 years? Currently, a CEO alone or maybe a few board members takes decisions, that's their job, also it doesn't necessarily mean all decisions they take are good. When the decisions are bad you have layoffs and pay cuts only for the employees, not the management to preserve profits. Similarly, it's the job of employees to act on those decisions and make it a reality. Now, when the value is generated, it only goes proportionally to the CEO and market cap, value, etc. doesn't apply even a bit to the employee's pay. You conveniently choose not to see the exploitation here and assume you'll find someone cheaper and more desperate to do that work, that's the root and rot of all problems. CEOs are overpaid. Period. > Sucks but why blame them? Just like as long as people have valuables thiefs are going to steal, why blame them? Why should we have law and order? Why should there be regulations? Lmao. If what these graduates are bringing to the table is so valuable, why isn't anyone else paying them more? Anyway, go lobby for regulations if you must. That's a completely valid take. Spot on. again a gujju defending overpaid capitalists and shady business lol Sure, people can choose to work freely. How about letting those free workers give their opinions on wages, management decisions, etc. Democracy is not just about being free to choose to work. Yeah they can't even afford food and rent, they will die and thus have no children to pass on the money to. Where's the problem? Lol yes, those guys are just full of crap 1000 hour work week butter Yeah, it was just imports that were restricted \"Economic growth\" doesn't mean crap if it only benefits the rich. All these numbers mean is that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Yeah, this exactly. I worked as a software developer, earned a lot of money, and I still think this system it's bad. Make me the richest man in the country and I will still call this system bad. No problem, we'll replace the useless CEO with AI. ChatGPT will provide. You don't even need socialism, what you need is proper labour laws and enforcement. We don't have proper enforcement of any law. There's no such thing as ethical capitalism, doing anything to regulate is against their interests. They will lobby against it or blackmail you with setting shop in another 3rd world country, that was again historically exploited by capitalists. A system that eats itself. I'm turned full blown socialist after seeing this bs. Socialism can also be bad when corruption and greed are involved. There is no perfect economic system, greed and corruption are the main enemy. Yes checks and balances are needed everywhere. If you think about it, corruption and greed is a product of inequality and both are heavily amplified under capitalism or it's earlier form feudalism because that's how you enable people to buy more = profits, have people to work, and corruption because of taking advantage of power hierarchies. Socialism is a fundamentally good way. The end goal is people collectively doing things, according to everyone's needs. It's already happening but all profits of work go to a few individuals. Capitalism does work OP. What shady business are we talking about here? These are public companies. What is it that you know that other investors don't? Underpaying employees is the shady business. Ever heard of supply and demand? > why isn't anyone else paying them more? Lobby or cartel comes to mind. If they are not bringing any value why hire them? rhetorical question. You're comparing two different things. Capitalism and slavery are not mutually exclusive. Capitalism, as an economic system, can coexist with various forms of labor arrangements, including slavery. Democracy in the workplace, beyond basic labour laws and regulations, would be a recipe for chaos and inefficiency. Businesses are designed for productivity and profitability. Employees are free to seek employment elsewhere if they disagree with management decisions. And those who seek a democratic workplace should start their own business or join a worker-owned cooperative. You start a business and have your own or 'outside' capital. The strategic decisions you make for the business determine the profitability and, therefore, the risk of capital. If you make bad decisions and provide no return on capital, the company could be dragged to courts, and with it, your net worth collapses, among other things. Example - SBF. I don't have my own capital or \"outside\" capital, I probably won't get \"outside\" capital even if I tried to. I am not educated, I don't know anything about capital or business or investment I can't ask anyone for advise or learn about it or go to college because I am from a rural village and a son of a small peasant worker. I am perfectly willing to take the action of \"risk\" if that would make me rich now tell me how do this \"risk\" thing and become rich? please tell me I just want to be rich and that all You start a business and take loan until you can get outside capital. By defining all odds I was somehow able to get a loan. I start a business and took the action of \"risk\" but the business failed I now owe money to the bank. Tell, why didn't I become rich even after taking \"risk\"? Because you took bad decisions since your business failed. You took ‘risk’ and failed. That’s why it’s difficult to scale business and turn them profitable. And who do become rich. How does this \"good\" decisions work? how do I take \"good\" decisions? By not taking bad decisions. How do I avoid taking \"bad\" decisions? Read? Learn? Experience? How would I learn? I can't afford college, I can't afford to go to the city, I can't consult with any businessmen or entrepreneurs. I obviously can't afford to have experience since I can't play the game in the first place. Public schools don’t require money and have scholarships. And who said you need formal education for business? You don’t need to consult if you’ve conviction. Where there is a will there is a way. Alright, I went to public school. I have the conviction, I have the will. Do you I want to be poor? Do you think I like being poor? I have the will, I desperately want to become rich. You say I don't need any formal education, So now that I have everything I need, I invested in nvidia but the stock price went down and I still haven't become rich. As I said, just because you took risk doesn’t mean you’ll be rewarded. That’s why it’s called ‘risk’. For Nvidia, maybe you invested at a high PE or have too short time-frame for your investment thesis to be realised. >For Nvidia, maybe you invested at a high PE or have too short time-frame for your investment thesis to be realised. Well I didn't know any of that before since I haven't studied anything or have any experience in it or some thing else. Why didn't I know that before? What should I do to know about such things? Read. I see you’ve internet. I learned from internet. I have to do peasant work daily but still I was somehow able to spend some time reading and did some investment and it still failed “Just because you took risk doesn’t mean you’ll be rewarded..” what should I do to get rewarded? Is there anything I can do to get rewarded? Read? Learn? Experience? How would I learn? I can't afford college, I can't afford to go to the city, I can't consult with any businessmen or entrepreneurs. I obviously can't afford to have experience since I can't play the game in the first place."
