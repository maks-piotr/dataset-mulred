    "selftext": "A couple from Lucknow, Jagdish and Sonam tied up a pregnant dog on a pole and trashed her. Then proceeded to tie her up and drag her with a motorcycle while beating her with a stick. The dog is in critical condition, with one of its legs fractured and other serious injuries.\n\nEven after police intervention, the couple continued to be aggressive and even threatened to kill the ones opposing this abuse. Their reasoning behind this horrifying act is that the dog allegedly bit their young child.\n\nMy question is simple- why was the child left alone? whose responsibility is it to watch the child, if not the parents?\n\nI've had dogs in my home my whole life, I've grown up fostering animals in my home and I know for a fact that animals, especially dogs, do not go out seeking people to hurt. There is no proof of that the child was harmed, if it was, I'm pretty sure it may have knowingly or unknowingly done something to aggravate the dog.\n\nBUT WHY THIS ABUSE? These vile  souls resorting to hurting an animal with such brutality is not for the sake of justice or revenge for their child, but for the mere satisfaction of their twisted egos and deriving pleasure from the pain of the innocent.\n\nIf a stray animal is causing harm to you or your loved ones, contact NGOs or other authorities to get that animal rehabilitated. Animals are loyal and loving to people who care for them, it's not rocket science. And if you can't do that, do the bare minimum- let other creatures live with peace and mind your own business, damn monsters.\n\nJust in February of this year, another such case happened in Lucknow, and now this.\n\nIt didn't even take much, after being booked by the police, they have already been released. In this country, the life of an animal is a mere rs. 50.
