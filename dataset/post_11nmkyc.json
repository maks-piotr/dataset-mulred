Most of them are understandable (e.g., medical conditions, racing, etc..). However, i noticed that they have a separate form for \"Self Employed Female\". Mind you, there is no form for \"Self Employed Male\". \n\nAlso, for some reason they seem to think the only professions women can get into is \"Tuition teaching\" or \"Beauty Parlors\". Is this just a way to assess the value of the individual's income (if so, why only women?), or is this just a sexist bias?\n\nLink: [https://onlineinsurance.hdfclife.com/questionnaires?appManager=Y](https://onlineinsurance.hdfclife.com/questionnaires?appManager=Y)\n\nAttaching screenshots of the form if the link isn't accessible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olhqhnaycwma1.png?width=765&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=45e76fba4665049c84ccce0200ae7c75eb9d3df3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ho77a6n0dwma1.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8a2ca6e2a97477bfd7d2a3caa8b1b47ae9b448dd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xojigyl2dwma1.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d646774db09c8c51779732bcdad3bb409dba266f",

If they get mass query from self employed women, who happen to be in the mentioned professions, they just put it on the questionnaire so that the women feels comfortable in filling out the form and thus gaining them a customer.\n\nUnfortunately, this category is historically proven as a high risk category as per data from para 1 so they are handed over a different form.\n\nHDFC is a for-profit company, they have investors (including the general public) who demand a return on their investment. They will sell insurance to a dead body if they see some profit. So please stop whining that HDFC is being sexist. They are not running a charity. They are just being smart and avoiding losses.",
