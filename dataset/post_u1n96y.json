        "Well I just completed HFW and that was an absolute 10/10 incredible game, I did expect the San Francisco section to be bigger the way they were doing marketing, that was disappointing when  it ended up being a small part of the map but other than that, phenomenal game\n\nHaven‚Äôt decided yet which game to do next",
        "Fellas I need some assistance. Which laptop do I get? \n\nLegion 5 Pro - Ryzen 7 5800H - 3060 6GB - 138k\n\nLegion 5i Pro - i7 11800H - 3060 6GB - 151k\n\nThing about Intel version is that it has thunderbolt and better pcie 4.0 support and better single core perf. But has heating issues and worse battery life. AMD performs about the same but without both these advantages and disadvantages. \n\nSo is the 13k investment really worth it for the intel version? \n\nKeep in mind I have a tight budget and upgrading from a Nitro Spin after 5 years. And I'd like to use this for the same amount of time if possible.",
        "Unless you absolutely want to use a high resolution external display, TB4 just doesn‚Äôt justify the price bump. Same with pcie gen 4. The last time I checked there wasn‚Äôt any real life improvement from pcie gen 4 unless you are using some crazy fast ssd which can utilise it, because the graphics card have no use for them.\n\nIntel doesn‚Äôt make sense unless you have very specific creative workload. If it‚Äôs just for gaming go for the Ryzen one",
        "I am 100% planning to use a high resolution external display, because I've already invested in one. So should I just bite the bullet and get the intel version then?\n\nOr just get AMD and go with HDMI.",
        "Legion 5 pro has hdmi 2.1 so you get support for 4K 120hz or 8k 60hz. Can‚Äôt say about multiple monitors",
        "Ah then that should be fine. Legion 5 Pro it is.\n\nAppreciate the help my friend.",

        "If Borderlands 3 is old what is Borderlands 2 and 1? archaic and stone age?",
        "Hey can you tell me where to start learning about computer specs and what they do. I feel like a noob. I never owned a good pc before and probably wont for some time but still wont hurt to know and understand the details",
        "Playing Arkham Asylum and its amazing. \n\nRiddlers challenges are annoying. I guess this is part of the fun. You feel like Batman .",
        "Wait this is 2019. Nvm not old lol. \n\nHave you played it? Should I be playing 1 and 2 first?",
