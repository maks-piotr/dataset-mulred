    "selftext": "My (27M) girlfriend's (26F) birthday is in a month and I'd like to buy something thoughtful for her. She really knocked it out of the park on my birthday when she got me a cake with a painting I made as frosting and knitted us as figures on a boat in a lake.\n\nHer birthday is in 1.5 months and I'd like to buy her something and do something special too. I could use a few ideas for the same.\n\nFor the gifts, I really liked the ones here: [https://www.oyehappy.com/](https://www.oyehappy.com/)  \nIt allows you to name a star after someone, give locked gifts whose codes are given over the span of 24 hours from loved ones, etc. I was wondering if anyone here knew of more stores like this.\n\nShe loves aesthetic lighting and interior design, books (mostly self-help and women-centric fiction),  and Delhi.\n\nI don't really have a budget but anything under 20k should be good to go.\n\nAppreciate any suggestions, thank you!",
