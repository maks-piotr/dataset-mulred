        "There is no justice for poor in India, not from the administration, police or from the courts. Makes me afraid sometimes ngl.",
        "1 Lakh?! How will 1 lakh help here?",
        "Don‚Äôt you know? It is enough to bring the woman and her son back from their death and also enough to make them pay their current taxes.",
        "Imagine your son dying an unjustified death, and in the process of finding justice for him, you had to wait so long that you also die without even hearing a semblance of justice.\n\n\nThat is actual hell. Something about how drawn out this is is truly fucked.",
        "Our legal system from police to the judiciary is just fucked up.",
        "Vishwaguru moment ? Everything is wrong in this country.",
        "There is no justice in India, anyone can get away with anything. When 1% Indians understand this, India will change for better.",
        "It's not just about Modi or bjp, our legal system has been like this for a long period. We need some serious reforms.",

        "Humanity is a lost cause.",
        "Indian legal system - from the grassroot level police to court, everything is fucked beyond imagination. I don't think she will get justice for her son's death. It has been 12 years, I can't even imagine what pain a mother had to go through for his son's unjustified death. There is no justice in India, if you do not have political links it's nearly impossible to get anything done.  This is so sad, it sucks that we can't even do anything about it.",
        "She has died btw while waiting for justice to be served. Heartbreaking honestly. There are so many similar cases like this eg the faizan case which is also in the news recently. Police and judiciary both are fucked up tbh.",
        "Very painful.",
        "Oh no, may she rest in peace. I literally have tears in my eyes as I type this. I wonder how many people have to go through this harassment in India daily asking for justice. Politicians and their relatives get away with disgusting crimes like rape and murder but an innocent poor Indian doesn't get justice. I have no hopes from this country anymore. This is inhumane.\n\nI have seen people getting away with rape, murder, fraud and what not just because of their political links. It honestly breaks my heart and infuriates me so much, but what can we even do - we are helpless. If we try to speak against these politicians or police officers they'll just lodge a fake case against us and put us in jail. They have done the same with a lot of journalists who tried exposing them. Worst case scenario, the politicians will use their goon to wipe the person who speaks against them out. Police won't even do anything because the police are just the puppet of politicians.",
