        "Hi Karun, great to have you here! \n\nWhen you were an active racing driver, did you ever concede (at least to yourself, or maybe to your close ones etc.) that someone else was quicker than you and you had no answer? If yes, how did you deal with it?\n\nI understand that you have to outwardly project the supreme confidence that you are the quickest driver everywhere and the lack of certain results were only due to the lack of the right opportunities (car, tire etc). But did you absolutely believe it every single day in every series?\n\nI am curious if a professional racer’s mind lets him ever accept to himself that he may not be the best in the field, based off talent and skills!\n\nP.S. Not knocking down your incredible results, just a general question!",

        "Hi! I would say there there was 1 occassion that really stood out -  I followed Lewis Hamilton around the Brands Hatch GP circuit when we were racing in F3. It was his F3 debut and the confidence and car control he showed was just extraordinary. It was the first time I saw another driver and thought \"there's no way I can do that\"",

        "The toughest is trying to get all the facts right in terms of knowing the rules and also calling incidents right, knowing that you have to make a live judgement.

        "Karun, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us: \"Take a trained monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.\" Thirty years later Sebastian told us: \"I had to start my car like a computer. It's very complicated.\" And Nico Rosbeg said, err, he pressed during the race, I don't remember what race, the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you to both. Is formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future, concerning technical program, errrm, during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more comunication with your engineers.",

        "Hi Karun!\n\nAre you team LH or MV this season?\n\nWhat are your views on India's involvement in F1 in near future? In terms of drivers and talent from india",
        "How can Indian citizen involve themselves in F1? It's my understanding that lack of racing experience and the weak passport are major barriers for non 1st world people to involve with F1 teams and there is not a lot of awareness of non engineering/non racing roles with F1 teams",
        "Hi Karun, what is your second favorite sport (assuming we know the 1st :) ) ?\n\nSecondly, who is the sportsperson who inspires you the most?",

        "The highest g-force is probably 5g at Istanbul park - turn 8. Racing drivers are like triatheletes but with a strong neck. Need good Cardio and strength.",

        "Hi Karun \n\nWhat're your thoughts about seeing another Indian driver in F1? Do you think it is possible that we might see Kush Maini or Jehan Daruvala in F1 in the future? Do you believe that we might soon see an Indian F1 WDC considering the recent rise of F1 in the country",
        "Hey Karun!\n\nLove your presentations and analysis on the broadcast, makes the broadcast feel alive!\n\nI really wanted to know what you think about the young Indian prospects in Kush Maini and Jehan Daruvala. Do you think they can set a big enough of an example to the rest of the nation for motorsports to grow? Do you think India can produce very talented drivers in the near future?",
        "Hi Karun? You are one of my favourites on Sky, love your analysis :) Will Fernando win a championship in the coming seasons? Same car, Fernando vs Max, who will win?",
        "I'd love to do a rally! My dad used to compete and also have a team so I used to do lots of testing when I was younger and really enjoyed it. I'd like to go back to India and do some rallies some time soon.",

        "What are your thoughts on ai and do you think it will change f1 in any way?",
        "Hi Karun,\n\nWho do you think can represent India in F1 ? who's on your radar ?",

        "Hi karun, your opinion about f1 pulling their streaming rights from India and only providing f1 tv being the only source to watch f1.",
        "Yo man. Over time it has been highly despressing to watch F1 as a Ferrari fan and especially as a Leclerc fan. What do you think he should do as the next move to bring himself to a level where Hamilton and Verstappen are? I highly feel he should leave Ferrari.",
        "Bhai, For becoming a F1 driver, Allen would be better or Aakash would be better.",
        "Would you agree that farcical finishes such as what happened at the Australian GP earlier this month are a by-product of the Netflix era, where manufacturing drama takes precedence over common sense and safety? (ending behind a safety car makes for bad television etc).\n\nEven so, surely the sensible thing to do with two laps to go would have been a rolling restart instead of a standing restart, which was quite frankly asking for the chaos that ensued at the end?\n\nAs a long-time fan of the sport, I am deeply concerned about decisions such as these in recent times that seek to maximise drama at all costs. Do you see this trend reversing anytime soon?",
        "What's the best Simulation platform for translating it into real-life motorsports in your opinion? and what do you like(or if you dislike) about the simulation experience compared to real life?",
        "Hi Karun, hope you're doing great  \n\n\nWhat do you think differentiates the BEST drivers from the others? Is it just a god-given talent that makes them stand apart or is there something anyone can work on hard enough to make it to the top?",
        "They're like all other professional sports people. Catch them at the right moment and they're great - catch them when it's going badly on track and you want to avoid them!!",
        "Hey karun I'm not Very familiar with f1 but in my engg cllg we have a formula car racing department which I aspire to join they compete SAE competitions i have a quiz and an interview coming up , how can I get myself up to join it.?

        "Hey Karun! Just a light query . How do you assess the upcoming upgrades of the top-of-the-grid teams now that the actual paces of teams have been seen in the first three races? \n\nAlso, do you hope in the near future that the Indian GP would make a return to the calendar?",
        "Hi\n\nWhy has DTS been such a hit with new fans but the original fans are not happy with the direction the sport is heading into?",
        "Hey Karun!\n\nHeard you had some connection with Chennai too. Is that true?",

        "Hi Karun! \n\nI wanna know about your thoughts on the current F2 grid from this year. Who do you think is going to be the first to graduate to F1? My guess is it's going to be Pourchaire, but I'm interested to know about your take.",

        "Hi Karun! Do you think Danny Ric has a chance of a comeback? If yes, which team do you think he should race for?",
        "I don't really have a problem with the standing start because I actually think the intention of having it is good for the show. The re-start in Baku with 2 laps to go a couple of years ago was great and gets everyone tuning in. On the final lap though, we should have just had a safety car that took everyone to the flag instead of that long wait for a final SC lap anyway.",
        "Hey Karun, \n\nWhats the toll a complete race takes on your body? How important is mental health in a season?",

        "Damn! 5G’s. That’s like a sukhoi doing a cobra pose",
        "Hi Karun\n\nAbout Mercedes. Rumours are rife that James Allison is back at Brackley.  \n\n\nSo how can he steer the Design and Engineering team different from Elliott.???\n\n\nWhat gains in performance are you expecting in the coming months??\n\nThanks in advance",
        "Just so we're clear, F1 didn't pull their rights - they opened the bidding but none of the networks wanted to take the rights at a fair price because of their investment in Cricket. It's disappointing and I hope one of the broadcasters takes it up again soon!",
        "ohh, I would have thought of the two being completely the other way around. ACC being the easiest to log on and play with your friends.  \nAlso, if you don't find, what kind of braking feel do you prefer in simulation racing. any modifications etc you have done to get the perfect feel for the same?",
        "Can someone replicate what Brawn GP did in 2009? To me personally, their achievement trumps everything else - the cars and the team they had. \n\nMy cousin won big betting on them that season and he talks about it all the time.",

        "Hi Karun, it’s great to have you here.. \nMy question to you is, do you see Budh Circuit back on the calendar anytime soon?",
        "Big picture - ditch the hybrids, make the cars smaller and bring back loud screaming V10 engines running on e-fuels.\n\nSmall picture - Don't allow tyre changes, repairs under red flags unless it's for safety.",
        "Have you ever tried playing computer racing games such as Need for Speed, Gran Turismo, Forza Horizon, or F1 games? If yes, how close are they compared to real racing? Also, why do we see so less F1 drivers from India? Considering a population of 1.45 billion, it's really bizarre that we don't get to see that many drivers from India.",
        "When was the last time you drove a car in Indian traffic? Still can do it? After all these years away?",
        "Both Jehan and Kush Maini are doing a good job in F2 but it's a tough step to make from there as there are a lot of other good drivers in the field also.",
        "I hope not! The human element is so important IMO.",
        "Depends on who ends up in a top car first but my guess would be Oscar...",

        "Hi Karun, who do you think was the real winner of Abh Dhabi 2021?",
        "One and only time I saw F1 live was at Budh International Circuit in U.P., India. Hopefully it happens again. Would love to go see it.",
        "I think Max will just sneak ahead in Qualifying but have to battle hard to hold on to track position in the race!! Fernando can certainly win if Aston give him the tools to do it.",
        "Hi Karun, I just wanted to know what's your favourite car to drive? Thank you.",
        "Hi Karun, why is F1 such a male dominated sport?",
        "Understandable, i hope the fanbase in India grows, i thinks the moto gp in India will pull more attention to racing in India",
        " Hi Karun! Good to see you here :) my question to you is - how do you feel about the environment impact of F1 as a sport ? Are there any initiatives to create real change ? As a fan it’s hard to defend the waste of resources",
        "Hi Karun! Was there any race in your career where you felt so mentally exhausted/tired that you thought about just quitting that race right there, and take a break?",
        "I hope so - I think we saw a step change between when Narain and I started and when these guys have begun in the sport. For example, we never had any kart tracks or did a kart race before racing in single seaters whereas this generation has come through the Indian karting ladder. There are a bunch of new race and kart tracks planned for the country so we'll see what effect that has soon.",

        "Cycling! I think it's a fascinating strategic contest with a huge human effort required from the riders. \n\nI would say Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal - to perform at the highest level for so many years is remarkable.",
        "Hey Karun, big fan, always point out to my parents that it's you when you come up on TV. Anyways\n\nWhich Indian driver do you think is most likely to end up in F1 in the near future.\n\nAlso which comes first, an Indian Driver, Race or a Team??\n\nThanks again",

        "I don't think it's got anything to do with the passport, rather the opportunities created by location. The sport is primarily based in the UK and Europe and therefore access to the sport from an early stage is harder for people in India.",

        "I'm team F1! Just want to see great races. \n\nI hope we get the Indian GP back sometime soon but it needs the government to jump on board like other countries have done. It doesn't make financial sense for any private business to take on the cost of the event.",
        "hi Karun everyone is asking about racing but I wanted to ask about your life.Other than racing how are you, how is your health, is F1 treating you well. And out of curiosity which is your favourite road car.?",
        "HI KARUN!!! non F1 related question\nWhat are your favorite movies so far?",
        "Your favourite tracks to drive in and your favourite track outside of the f1 calendar",
        "Hi Karun, \nWhat are your thoughts on the rising costs of competing in single seaters? Are the cost caps effective, or do we need to do more to keep the lower rungs of the sport accessible?",

        "How much weight you loose during race?",
        "In the rain, it happens a lot! \n\nImagine you're rocking your chair back and forth in a school class room. There's that moment when you nearly fall over and you get that shock feeling all through your body when you catch it. Now imagine that at every corner of a wet race!!",
        "Hi Karun! \nWhat is your most memorable moment off the track during one of the race weekends?\n\nAlso, who do you think has the most potential from the current F2 grid?",
        "I just used to cut myself off from the outside world as much as possible. Talk to as few people as possible, read very little news and just focus on the job with my engineers and mechanics.",
        "Hi Karun,\n\nWhat do you think of the Maini Brothers Making it to F1 ?",
        "Hi Karun,\n\nLove that you're part of the team! I enjoy hearing your thoughtful and well reasoned takes/analysis of the on track action.\n\n1. How did you get started in commentary? Was it something you planned for or just a happy accident? And what are your favourite and least favourite (but not necessarily bad) things about the job?\n2. Outside of F1 what are your favourite track/road cars you've driven?",
        "Hi Karun, \nKudos for the work you do on sky sports. Top notch stuff !\nThe current crop of racers in F1 (last 2-3 years) literally pace their race like robots. They hit the exact time that they are asked to, and make maybe just a mistake or two all race.\nDo you think in the pre turbo hybrid era, the consistency of racers accross the field was this high ? Or are these current gen racers so good that they really gel with the cars so well .",

        "Which Indian talent has the best chance to get into f1?",
        "Any chance india fould restart F1 in Budh Circuit.",
        "Hi Karun! Which former F1 circuit would you like to see in the F1 calendar?",
        "Yeah that right tho",
        "Wish her all the very best! Raising the funding to compete is hardest thing, especially in India. Ultimately results speak for themselves - when I started I had no sponsors but I won the Indian racing championship in my first year that secured some backing from JK Tyres. I then won the first 5 races of the Formula Asia championship which helped to attract more backing. If you're not competitive - man or woman - it's hard to get anyone to invest.",
        "Hey Karun ! \n\nJust got F1TV in India. \n\nWhich races would you say are a must watch ? \n\nAlso can you please recommend some good books on motorsport ? \n\nPS - Love your commentary ! And realised the other day that your brother is doing the IPL shows. You two are great !",
        "All else equal, whose faster, Narain or you?",

        "Hey! I have a question: How difficult was it to make it to international motorsports and F1 being born and raised in india?",
        "Hi, hope you are doing well. How did you go about making changes to the layout of tracks?? Yas Marina has improved a lot after the changes a few years back despite the final sector being kinda meh with the hotel preventing any changes to it.",
        "What infrastructure does India need for young f1 drivers.. Thank you",
        "Hey karun, \n\nWhat do you think about sim racing? \nCan we see it being popular in India and if so as we've seen on other places that people transition from sim to IRL , can we see that happening in India.\n\nAlso if you sim race , can we ever join you ?",
        "Lot's of people ask me about AD 2021... \n\nI was in the commentary box with Martin Brundle and David Croft. It was a super intense season and when that final SC came out and Mercedes opted to stay out, I knew Max would pit for new tyres. \n\nTo be honest, I expected the lapped cars to all stay in position between Lewis and Max and I think that would have been the fair way to settle it. Max would have passed the lapped cars by turn 9 but Lewis would have had a 2 second advantage by then and that would have set up a spectacular battle in the final few corners! \n\nI was surprised and disappointed that some of the lapped cars were allowed to go around because it made it predictable that Max would pass Lewis.",
        "Hi karun.. are you friends with Charles Leclerc? 🙈",
        "Hi Karun, what do you think about F1 would be regionalisation of calendar have effects on drivers and team generally?",

        "Who is your favourite non WDC driver from the 2000s ? Do you have a favourite driver pairing from that time? For me it's Ralf and JPM",
        "Hi Karun! \n  \nDo you think Max would ever got bored and just leave F1 for something else?    \n  \nMax comes of as such a racing nerd, someone who loves the act of racing so much that even the sport of F1 itself is secondary to the art form of racing for him.     \nMax has hinted before that he would leave F1 if he's not enjoying it anymore. If hypothetically the RB dominance continues till his contract ends, do you see him leaving F1?",
        "How's your F1 Fantasy team doing?",
        "Hi Karun, do you think Mazepin was over-hated?",
        "Did lack of Indian racers in Force India F1 team, fail to create an impact among the casual fans of F1 in India.",
        "What did you go through to become a F1 driver and can I be a F1 driver 🤔 too ?",
        "The Jimmie pick is definitely intriguing. His only real open-wheel experience came after he retired from NASCAR and went to Indy in his mid-40s. He did well at some of the oval races but was usually lingering at the back at traditional circuits. He wasn’t really known to be much of a “road course ringer” in NASCAR either. Not to say that couldn’t have succeeded in F1, but I would probably take some other NASCAR drivers such as Kyle Larson, AJ Allmendinger, or maybe even Austin Cindric before Jimmie",

        "Suzuka, Silverstone, Le Mans and Monaco",
        "No!!",
        "Hey Karun,\n\nSpa or Monza, which one do you like better and why?",
        "Yes he’s fantastic. Why do you think elliot failed? He has the same skillset as allison, especially aerodynamics",
        "Hi Karun\nDo you think if FIA allows to challenge past results now, would it resolve some of the most curious what ifs in F1 or will it be a nuisance?",

        "I think in general it's hard to go back on technology although I would say in general the cars have now got too many electronic adjustment options on them because of the hybrid systems. I don't have a problem with the communication but I think if we get rid of the hybrids it would make the cars less complex, lighter and smaller so better for racing.",
        "Is your schedule more hectic now as a pundit than it was as an f1 driver?",
        "Yes... I have known Narain since I was 9 years old. I visited him in the UK to watch him race in F3 on a few occassions and we have spent a lot of time together. There were certainly moments where external pressures from the media and sponsors made our relationship strained and there were times where we didn't get along but on the whole, we always respected each others abilities and today I would say we are friends and proud members of the exclusive club of 2 in 1.4 billion!",
        "Hi Karun, not a question but just wanted to point out we’re related lol",
        "When will Ferrari fix their car/strat team if ever? 😭",
        "Hi Karun, \n\nSo glad to have you here! \n\nI wanted to know what your thoughts are about what happened in Abu Dhabi in the final race of 2021 where it boiled down to become a one lap race between Max and Lewis, after the safety car mess. What do you think FIA needs to do to prevent such situations from reoccurring in the future?",
        "Very interesting! Thanks for the AmA.",
        "Hi Karun,\nI'm curious to get your thoughts on racing at Buddh International. Has the idea of hosting events such as F2, F3, F1 Academy, or even Formula Regional Asia been considered. \n\nI have wished for an \"Asian GP\" similar to European GP with a rotating calendar of Sepang, Korea, India, Fuji, and any other circuit that is looking to bid to host F1!",
        "Hi Karun,\nImagine if F1 came back to India to a street circuit. Which one would it be?",
        "How much physics knowledge do drivers have to work with? Your review of application of data in strategy for teams?",
        "Ah very fair answer! Thank you for taking the time to answer x",
        "Give me an award",
        "Dear Karun\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you with a burning question that has been on my mind for a while. As an F1 racer, I am sure you are the best person to answer this question.\n\nWhat qualifications does one need to become an F1 racer, and how does one go about getting into F1 racing? \nKindly answer this questions",
        "Lmao",
        "Hey Karun, what cars do you enjoy driving outside of F1?",
        "hey karun when do you think mercedes can catch up if the upgrades in baku works considering red bull has disadvantage of wind tunnel time testing?\n\nalso which is your favorite f1 car?",
        "That was a robbery",
        "Hello Karun Sir,\n\nhope you are doing well.\n\nout of so many options as career what got you into f1!?, especially being an indian",
        "Have been a great follower of you and this adrenaline sports. How do I get your autographed car replica?",
        "Hi karun\n\nDo you have any favourites from the current lot of f1 drivers?",
        "Hi Karun! Who do you think is the fastest driver in F1 today if the constructor / engine was not a factor?",
        "Could India be a destination of note for Formula E?",
        "Thanks for the answer, and thanks to autocorrect for fudging up your name 😬",
        "Kitna mileage deti hai ?",
        "Sir please tell me your one beautiful school memory",
        "Do you think the FIA should actively work towards making cars smaller 2026 onwards. We got the best wheel to wheel racing pre 2017, since then the cars despite getting faster have become like boats. Maybe focus towards making barriers more shock absorbent than relying on broad and heavy crash structures around the cockpit?",
        "Did you do this with Karthikeyan AMA too ?",
        "Will Kush maini or Jehan have still chance to F1,\n\nKush is showing some solid performance this season. He should atleast gt some in F1 academy",
        "Hey Karun, what are the chances of either Daruvala or Maini going to F1?",
        "Do you believe in Aston Martin's Godalonso's hypetrain?",
        "Great answer Karun",
        "Did he leave out Horner on purpose?",
        "True. Jimmie Johnson was solid in ovals most notably at Texas Motor Speedway last year but the road courses were super rough. Even at his Nascar cameo in COTA it was unfortunate he was DNF'd in the opening laps",
        "What's your take on the new race weekend format for Azerbaijan? Are you in favor of Sprint qualifying?",
        "Have you ever been in a jet boat? That's the highest G experience I've ever had. Truly otherworldly experience. I can't even imagine a F1 car.",
        "Christian has been TP at Red Bull for its entire time in F1. He means him no disrespect, I'm sure.",
        "Bwoah",
        "Yessss CSK massive.",
        "He did..",
        "This is a meme on r/cricket Knowledgeable Chennai Crowd™. Btw did you kart or race during your sishya days? I remember the mammens arranged to take some sections to sriperambadur every once in a while.",
        "How about controlling a space ship?",
        "r/formula1",
        "Brit living in the US. I really enjoy your commentary on the F1 feed. Keep it up!",
        "Hey Karun, do you think Charles and Russell would be a beneficiary combo for Mercedes in future (e.g: 2026,2027) ??",
        "But there's a difference between experiencing 5 G's ina linear fashion as opposed to the vertical G forces experienced in a fighter? Max Verstappen crossed 51 Gs laterally during a crash",
        "Karun!  I never thought I'd have a medium to directly say hi.  I just wanted you to know that I think your contributions to F1 commentary are astounding, and I hope you're fulfilling a dream by doing it!\n\nKeep up the great work! Cheers from California",
        "I mean, it's a very famous copypasta...",
        "Who is the driver u find rooting for the most?",
        "How bad is the politics in F1?",
        "Bro, Do U think Kush Maini Has A Chance? HE IS DRIVING MEGA.",
        "I missed this AMA but that's alright. Just wanted to say I'm a big fan of yours! It was great watching you and narain in the F1 circuit. I'm not following f1 actively anymore.\n\nI also have a picture with you from my first BAJA competition all the way back in 2010-11! Glad that i was able to recognize you ! :)",
        "Yes but Narain didnt answer the question unfortunately",
        "THALA moment",
        "Hey , which is the best college to pursue motorsport engineering in india??\nAsking for myself.",
        "Whats the money like in F1?",
        "Did F1 mess up not having a broadcast and streaming partner in India and relying solely on F1 TV?",
        "kaun hai bhai yeh",
        "Why Ferrari is a meme?",
        "Hi Karun, it is an pleasure interacting with you!\nJust one thing, how does that initial acceleration feels in a F1 car? If I want to compare it with something which will be the best?",
        "Hi karun\nI was wondering what were some cool and quirky cars that you have had the chance to drive and hoon around in.",
        "Hi karun, what do feel about jehan's future",
        "TFAR",
        "You dog 😂",
        "F1 driver banke sax sux mila?",
        "Just wanna say I love your commentary",
        "He races in f2 and is in fe as a reserve driver",
        "it was karma",
        "Then max will get karma for driving like a drunk man in india...maybe vegetable state coming soon😂😂",
        "whatever the right guy won in the end.",
        "No he didn't....rules weren't followed...",
        "Whats ur favourite race?",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Hi, it's Karun Chandhok. Join me for a live AMA!",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Hi, it's Karun Chandhok, former F1 driver and commentator. I'll be live for the next 1 hour - Ask Me Anything! EDIT : Thanks very much for all the questions - I've tried to answer as many as possible!! Will try and do another AMA again soon. Enjoy the rest of the F1 season ahead!",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Hi Karun, great to have you here! When you were an active racing driver, did you ever concede (at least to yourself, or maybe to your close ones etc.) that someone else was quicker than you and you had no answer? If yes, how did you deal with it? I understand that you have to outwardly project the supreme confidence that you are the quickest driver everywhere and the lack of certain results were only due to the lack of the right opportunities (car, tire etc). But did you absolutely believe it every single day in every series? I am curious if a professional racer’s mind lets him ever accept to himself that he may not be the best in the field, based off talent and skills! P.S. Not knocking down your incredible results, just a general question! What's the toughest AND most rewarding thing about being a commentator? Hi! I would say there there was 1 occassion that really stood out - I followed Lewis Hamilton around the Brands Hatch GP circuit when we were racing in F3. It was his F3 debut and the confidence and car control he showed was just extraordinary. It was the first time I saw another driver and thought \"there's no way I can do that\" Hi Karun What are your thoughts on Ferrari this year and do you think the redbull dominance continues for the next coming seasons?and one small doubt how it feels after driving an F1 car driving your car be like? With F1 no longer being broadcast on any of the sports channels, and only available via the F1tv pro subscription, do you think this would have an impact on the popularity of the sport in India ? Hi Karun, Do people recognize you in public? The toughest is trying to get all the facts right in terms of knowing the rules and also calling incidents right, knowing that you have to make a live judgement. The most rewarding is hearing that the audience enjoy listening to what you have to say and feel like they've learned something! What are other F1 drivers like when you meet them in person? Both good and bad things...without naming names. ;-) Which drivers do you wish had a chance to drive in F1 but never did? Hi Karun. How long do you think we have to wait to see another Indian driver on the F1 grid? Hi Karun, big fan of yours. I’m curious if you ever considered getting into Rally ? Also what’s your favorite car ? When is F1 coming back to India???? Who are your top 5 sportsman? What are some things that you wish you knew earlier? What is the maximum G force you have experienced? And how do you train your body to handle that kind of force,Does body type matter? Hi Karun! Who in your personal opinion is the friendliest driver on the grid? Hey Karun, non F1 related question - Which team do you support in the IPL? And why? Hi karun chandhok, who is your favourite f1 driver of all timee and who do u think will win 2023 championship Bhai sarkari Naukri kese crack kare Whats your favourite location to race? Ferrari haven't really built on last season and it's been a disappointing start to the year with both performance and reliability. I expect Mercedes to take a big step forward in Imola so Ferrari need to really raise their game. Driving an F1 car is an experience that's hard to replicate - the ultimate adrenalin rush. Heyyyy, I wanted to ask what makes Red Bull and Max Verstappen so dominating in the sports of Formula1. I’m sure it’s not just one factor but multiple, it would be really nice if you could elaborate on what you think about the Red Bull domination! What's your top speed in Indian road? Obviously CSK - I'm born and raised in Chennai! How tall are you what are your views on kush maini?? Have you given thought to having a Club100 type karting series in India? Would it lower the entry barrier, equal equipment, costs etc. will you date a pilot? What do you do when you get car sick during a race? Hello! I just wanted to ask when did you get interested in F1? And what exactly interests you the most? Common Karun W You recently drove some vintage f1 cars, how much are they different than what you drove and the mercedes which you drove sometime ago Hey Karun, what do you think are the chances that Danny Ric is back on the grid next year? I know he performed poorly at McLaren but I honestly believe he is one of the best out there and just one failed stint with a team really harmed him. Karun, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us: \"Take a trained monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.\" Thirty years later Sebastian told us: \"I had to start my car like a computer. It's very complicated.\" And Nico Rosbeg said, err, he pressed during the race, I don't remember what race, the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you to both. Is formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future, concerning technical program, errrm, during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more comunication with your engineers. What was the worst and best experience you had while being a F1 racer? What was your scariest moment on track? What do you think about the upcoming talent in f2? Khush and Jehan? Carlos Sainz, Charles Leclerc, Checo, Oscar, Albon, George, Max... Most of them really! Love listening to you, Karun. Always a new learning experience. How to get into F1 paddock? I want all the possible ways. Time horizon: 5 years. Karun! Hello! What’s life like in the paddock? Do you enjoy the travel and watching all these races live, or does it get exhausting? I'll be going college this year, Just in case if someone wants to be F1 racer, what he needs to do? Do someone needs a lot of money to do it? I have nothing to ask, but I have to tell you how proud it makes me, as an Indian, to see someone ‘make it’ in the sport - even if you didn’t get all your success on track, as a mainstay analyst/pundit/commentator. Also your Beyond the Grid episode was such a pleasure to listen to. Hi karun, Which team is your favourite (one from the current season) and why so? Why don't Indian automotive manufacturers lead a consortium like Lawrence Stroll? Hi Karun! Simply Lovely to have you here! Do you think there has been any significant changes in driving styles of drivers from the 2022 cars to the 2023 cars? What’s the the one thing or a rule you would like to change from F1 as it stands today? Thank for making us Indians so proud Sir 😇 Hi Karun! Can you share with us a memorable experience from the F1 paddock while you were competing? What's your take on Jehan Daruvala's chances of making it into F1 and his impact on the future of F1 in India? How soon can we see a F1 race happening in India again? Hey Karun! How hard is it driving a car that does not feel competitive? At moments like this how do you keep your cool knowing that a major part of the audience calls you out for not driving well without studying the facts about the car or the technical issues? Hi Karun, Any chance of lobbying for the india GP to return to the F1 calendar?. Okay! Who do you enjoy interviewing the most? Hey there! My question is: Have you ever had a near death experience? If yes, what were your thoughts at that point. Hi Karun, What was the best part for you when you were racing in Formula 1? Mujhse shadi karoge? Scope of f1 racing in india. Can india win any trophy in f1 in future. Hi Karun, Can you explain how and why Ferrari lost confidence in their car concept? He's a great talent and as a friend it was awful to see his slump at Mclaren. It's going to be hard for him to come back because there aren't really many testing opportunities for the team to evaluate him but let's see! Ayee Marwadi dukan pe jaa Hi Karun, Huge fan! How did you get into the sport of racing? Was this a life choice that was questioned? Cheers! Hi Karun Do you think Perez has what it takes to challenge Verstappen for the title ? Hey Karun! How is it like working with the Sky commentators? Ted and Krofty come with some great spontaneous one liners and jokes 🤣 What skills does a young individual need to reach where you are rn? How difficult it is to reach there? Hi, Karun. How can I pursue a career in racing and potentially one day be a lmp1 driver if I have the skills. I don't have money. Where and how can I start? Or is it even possible? Thanks. What colour is your buggati? Well in that case, who's the least friendliest driver on the grid? Hello karun how are you feeling about representing India at world stage? Apart from F1 car which car would you like to drive around in a circuit?? Which cars do you like to drive on normal roads? Hi Karun, how was Goodwood? What do you think are the major differences in drivability across the generations of F1 cars you’ve driven? Which one did you like the best? Buisness kar le yahi best hai. Is it ok to break red signal before 715am in India? Hi Karan, what would be the proper timeline for a 10 year child who wants to become an F1 Driver in India ? Hi Karun How do you think Star pulling F1 will affect the popularity of the sport in india? I am sure not many people can get F1TV, so it must be a negative effect. Is F1 taking a step to find another broadcast partner? How to make India a hotbed for future f1 drivers ? Hi karun, Karthikeyan said I have absolutely no chance of becoming an F1 driver because I'm a broke 22 yo. What do you say about me having a chance of becoming a team principal ? How can F1 be a more popular sport for the Indian audience? What do you think might be the issue with Mercedes this year? Always been a fan of F1 karun! And always look forward for your voice on the commentary from the pitlanes! Which F1 driver is the funniest in your opinion!? Hello Karun, How does brake bias work? Hi Karun , why aren’t Indian rave drivers able to break into the international scene ? Hi Karun, What cars do you have in your garage? Is the season over with Red Bull winning both the championshipa or we can see some possible comeback from any of the teams? A gap of approx 1s is too much to cover. Which teams do you think can catch up to RedBull this year? do u think it’s so hard to get/ be in F1 being an Indian?If yes what discrimination and mishaps did u face? Hi karun, what do you think about are the reasons behind less craze of f1 in india? What should be done to improve grassroots racing in India Hello Karun, Why are drivers always accompanied by the PR teams in any kind of interviews? This looks like the drivers do not have the full freedom to speak their minds post race or question the FIA on some decisions made. At the end of the day, the drivers are the ones in the cockpit. Hey Karun! Great to see you here. Just wanted to know your thoughts on the sprint weekend changes and the possibility of pure sprint weekend to accommodate more tracks in a season. How does F1 funding work? Everyone has a lot to say but how does a good funding help you out in ways that the audience doesn’t know about yet? Hi Karun, how do you get a chance in a better team when you know the car you are driving is not up to par with the top F1 team cars? Hi Karun What are your thoughts about the rumour of Sebastian replacing Helmut Marko in Redbull. Do you think he will be able to lead the team in a way Dr. Marko did for so many years ?? What your opinion of Indian in F 1 Mahindra is getting into it ?? Hi Karun, Thank you for taking the time to do this. What is a moment that keeps popping into your head from your career in Motorsport and then one that sticks in your your mind from the broadcasting side? If I put all the drivers in the F2002 Ferrari. Who would win at Monaco? Hi Karun, hope you're doing great! We thoroughly enjoy your commentary and stats.

Hi Karun What does it take to be a F1 commentator. Like the qualifications and where to apply for such a position? Thank you Do you think Danny Ric will get a place on the grid soon? Thank you so much for your response. What do you think about motorsport talent in India? Can we see the rise of motorsport after formula E has been in India? How expensive is it to get into F1? Hello there... What approach should I follow on becoming a professional racing driver? I've been karting for approx 4-5 years and am planning to take up GT3 racing as my finish line Which car do you own/drive daily? Alonso's win in some of the recent grand prix has changed the dynamics of F1. What do you see as the future for Indian racing scene? I feel we are out dated with our flgb and formula MRFs. What do you think fmsci should do to bring forth new series and attract talent worldwide? Leclerc or Verstappen? Dei karun Chennai kaaran thaane nee? What would you say are the best ways to promote f1 here in chennai How does it feel before a race? How do you prepare your self mentally for one of the most challenging sports in the world? What's the first thing that comes to your mind when hear Omni? I've been lucky to drive F1 cars from every decade starting with a 1937 Aston Martin right through to the 2019 Mercedes. The evolution of the sport has been fascinating but my favourite era of cars is the early 1990s, although the 2004 Williams BMW was the most awe inspiring car I ever drove. The more modern ones almost seem too perfect and the electronics and weight make them too benign. Hi Karun, What’s your favourite car in the current Indian Market? A little fun! Have you ever heard music while in a race? Ahaha Kitna bhi sochlo ek accha idea nahi aata bhai...aur AA bhi Gaya to investment ko Paisa nahi hai Hi Karun.

How was the racing experience for u in India compared to other countries? Any f1 championship can happen in india like ipl. Hi Karun! Which one was the toughest race for you to drive, in your career? Following up, which track was the hardest for you? Hey Karun, who's your favourite F1 driver and team? Also, which driver do you look up to? Any inside scoop if F1 will be returning to Buddh? Why are there not any women drivers in F1 Favourite memory in F1? Hi Karun, So you think in the coming years , are we going to see F1 back in India again? And which was your favourite track to race in? :) Hey dude! You're lit as fuck, glad to see you on here. I always wondered if that neck training thing to deal with the pull of inertia on our heads during a very steep turn, do you do that, like is that a mandatory training for all F-1 racers? And knowing how weightless you can feel , does nausea ever affect your performance or do you set aside a specific section of your faculties to deal with it? I mean, do you compartmentalize driving and not puking while you're on the seat? Or is it all reflexes? Hey,So how big of upgrades are gonna come this race week from Mercs & Ferraris? Hi, Karun. My brother is a fan. Please say Hi Gautam. What are some F1 experiences that give adrenaline rush. Thank you Hi Karun, Don’t have a question for you. Writing to say we appreciate your insightful input as a commentator and wish you all the best for the future :) Favourite memory in F1? Hi Karun... Which is your favourite team in the paddock this season?? I don't know when I was NOT interested in F1! The first race I remember watching was the 1987 British GP when I was 3 so I guess it started then. The on track competition between drivers and teams is what drew me in first Hey karun, just wanted to say hi... Hi Karun. We all know how expensive F1 is and the investment it takes from a very young age. Would you mind sharing how you and your family managed the finances to make a career in F1? As an ambassador for F1, In India. What would you advice the younger generation about getting into the world of racing from India? Hi Karun, Do you think Kush Maini can do what Jehan couldn't? Was Jehan India's best shot at having a Formula 1 driver for a while? Never happened to me!! Freelancing, YouTube Channel, Blogging kar le ghar pe baithe. With already very limited but passionate viewers in a country like India were F1 could actually do crazy good, don’t you think this move of streaming only on f1 tv pro is indication about how serious f1 is about India and what are your thoughts on bharat gp ? Err.... no! My wife will object.. Hahaha Why were you so adamant to defend the scam by FIA in 2021 finale ? Why couldn’t you hold that public discussion to hold FIA accountable? Hi Mr. Chandhok, Do you believe in karma? Hi Karun ,are Sprint race bad for the teams in terms of tyre management? Will it affect the main race? Hi Karun, What are your views on Jehan Daruvala and his career trajectory at the moment? Did you ever get a chance to have a discussion with him? What do you make of Stefano Domenicali's views on tracks, red bull dominance etc. ? I personally don't agree with a lot of those. Hi karun, What’s your prediction for the silly season this year. Is it going to be as wild as 22 ? There’s a rumour that there might be a swap between lewis and leclerc. Do you see norris making a move ? And is perez safe for 24 ? You are an F1 insider and have been on the grid as a driver yourself, I have a question for you. who do you think will win the world championship if the below mentioned drivers all drive the same car? 1. Max Verstappen 2. Lewis Hamilton 3. Fernando Alonso Is there any chance of vettle returning to grid or will he be in any prospects related to f1 and any predictions regarding Daniels future? Absolutely - I think Club 100 is a fantastic format and one that should be copied in developing countries like India Hey Sir, I'm new to F1 just trying to learn the basics. How would you explain the sport to someone like me? Hey Karun, What do you think about the financial constraints new enthusiasts face and what opportunities could one take advantage of for excelling in this sport. Hi Karun! , who among Maini and Daruvala has a better chance of getting to f1 ? Unrelated, but were your ancestors from Pakistan side of Punjab. I have lots of relatives with Chandhok surname and all of them were from Rawalpindi/Potohar region of current Pakistan. Hi Karun, The reason i miss the refueling of cars during the race is because of permutations and combinations one could see with the strategy. Do you think the refueling of the cars should be back on during the race if they can meet the safety parameters? Hi Karun. I am going way into the past with this question. I started watching motorsports religiously back in 2005 when Narain joined F1. In the same year, you joined the Indian team in the newly formed A1 Grand Prix. How was your experience in the series (a series that I still fondly remember) and the team? Hey Karun, Your thoughts on Kimi as a professional? Contradictory to his media episodes, I've read he's so verbose in his communication regarding the setups he requires... Your thoughts? Golden Is your neck still strong enough? Can we anticipate F1 coming back to India ever again? Also is there any possibility of an Indian team as well? What's your favourite race track? Who's your favorite?? Mine's Fernando Alonso Hey Karun! How did you know you wanted to become a racer? :P I think he's doing a great job this season. He's matured very well and is putting in a really solid rookie F2 season. Hi karun, i have more than one question. 1. What do you think about the current state of Formula 1 in India? Is there a chance of getting the Indian GP back? 2. What is it like working with crofty? 3. If you were given the chance to drive any formula one car from any era which one would you like to take to a track? 4. How are you? 5. Do you think there is a chance of Formula 1 and Formula E merging together sometime in the future seeing how much everyone is concerned about the environment? 6. What's the best part about working in Formula One? 171cm! What are the chances of a new grand prix in India in future and how many years it may take ? Describe yourself in 3 words. Hi Karun, what are your thoughts on alpine ? They claimed they would be on front along mercedes. Hi Karun Do you think that we need to build more racetracks so that F1 & other racing sports are encouraged? We have one at Noida right? Any more upcoming? Hi Karun, Which is more fun commentating? F1 or FE, btw enjoy both of them though Hi Karun, Can you comment on your experiences with reflex training, preparing for the effects of heat on the body along with how you coped with fluids and weight loss through the course of a race? Chances of F1 coming to India next year? Hey Karun !!! What would you say to someone who doesn't follow F1 to get them hooked on to the sport ? Being an Indian, how did you find motivation towards embarking upon a career in racing? Do you think f1’s rule are partial to particular teams as is? What changes would you like to see? Oh that's cool it was meant for you since the beginning! Momentum is a huge thing in this sport. They are riding high on confidence after the past 2 years, they have consistency in terms of people, partners and drivers and the whole operation is technically at a very high level with Adrian Newey, Rob Marshall, Paul Monaghan and Pierre Wache in charge. Hi Karun, How is the Indian representation in F1, especially in roles which aren't visible on TV? Thanks! Hi Karun! What are your thoughts on how F1 can do more for sustainability? Do you think there can be a transition to flex fuel in such high performance engines? And if so, how will it change things for the drivers? Hi Karun! I know you might not be accustomed to this question but I'm asking away anyway. How hard is it for a woman to enter F1? There is nothing I love more than driving and I know it is far fetched to even think about it but I'd really like to know what the odds are. Hi karun, 1. do you have any insights on if there are any talks going between FIA and Indian govts to restart hosting f1 once again in India. 2. we all know what the actual cause of the break-up, but what kind of compromises there should be on both the sides for this to be resolved. 3. If F1 to be hosted once again in India, what kind improvements the race drivers look for in the good old Budh circuit or if a new one to be constructed Thanks for your time Gentlemen... Silverstone - great track, great atmosphere, knowledgeable fans! Hi Karun! Can you describe the moments around you, and the stuff going around you just before the race finish at Abu Dhabi in 2021? absolute gem How can one get the general Indian population to experience the thrill of racing, considering there are only 3 real tracks, and a track day culture doesn’t exist a lot here? Ha ha ha ha... Nicely done! With MotoGP coming to India this year, do you think Motorsports will finally kick off in India or will it meet the same faith as F1 did. My three favourites are Alain Prost, Jim Clark and Mario Andretti. Hard to bet against Max for the 2023 title! Hi karun. வணக்கம்! நலம் அறிய ஆவல் சென்னையிலிருந்து! . I am huge car enthusiast and been following F1 since 2010. one of my close friend is an upcoming racer. She wishes to fight with the current competition and take part in single sweater monocoque chassis racing as soon as possible. She is hard working and very determined to achieve her goal but is currently struggling to get sponsors. What are the advice you would like to give her? She is also from Tamil nadu but lives in Bangalore and is currently undergoing karting training in kari moto track. I wanted to send my motivation to her through your words. Please consider :) have a great day! Karun what was it like to feel that ur one of the few Indians to be in F1? And what are your thoughts on INDIAN GP return? Hi Karun, How do you manage to be focused and in the moment during races. Did you used some habits, rituals to get that level of focus? Hey Karin, have you ever had a moment where you felt like you almost lost control of your car but managed to save it? If yes, how did that moment feel? Hi Karun! Are you team LH or MV this season? What are your views on India's involvement in F1 in near future? In terms of drivers and talent from india How can Indian citizen involve themselves in F1? It's my understanding that lack of racing experience and the weak passport are major barriers for non 1st world people to involve with F1 teams and there is not a lot of awareness of non engineering/non racing roles with F1 teams Hi Karun, what is your second favorite sport (assuming we know the 1st :) ) ? Secondly, who is the sportsperson who inspires you the most? Hey Karun, just wanna say I'm proud to have you representing India in the F1 scene. Always a pleasure to hear you commentating! The highest g-force is probably 5g at Istanbul park - turn 8. Racing drivers are like triatheletes but with a strong neck. Need good Cardio and strength. Hi Karun, Do you watch Drive to Survive? Favourite season so far? Any signs of danny ric being back in the car this season?? 🍯 🦡 Hello Sir, Which was that one most interesting race of yours you would never forget? Do you think Lewis will win another title? And what are your thoughts on what happened in the final race of 2021? Hi Karun What're your thoughts about seeing another Indian driver in F1? Do you think it is possible that we might see Kush Maini or Jehan Daruvala in F1 in the future? Do you believe that we might soon see an Indian F1 WDC considering the recent rise of F1 in the country Hey Karun! Love your presentations and analysis on the broadcast, makes the broadcast feel alive! I really wanted to know what you think about the young Indian prospects in Kush Maini and Jehan Daruvala. Do you think they can set a big enough of an example to the rest of the nation for motorsports to grow? Do you think India can produce very talented drivers in the near future? Hi Karun? You are one of my favourites on Sky, love your analysis :) Will Fernando win a championship in the coming seasons? Same car, Fernando vs Max, who will win? I'd love to do a rally! My dad used to compete and also have a team so I used to do lots of testing when I was younger and really enjoyed it. I'd like to go back to India and do some rallies some time soon. Hey karun! So nice of you to do this! My question is Which new rookie of 2023 season do you think will win a race first? Nyck, Logan or Oscar? What are your thoughts on ai and do you think it will change f1 in any way? Hi Karun, Who do you think can represent India in F1 ? who's on your radar ? You wake up and you're the FIA. What changes do you make in the motorsport today? Kari or MMSC? Jehan is moving to Formula e Rick Mears, Scott Dixon, Tom Kristensen and Jimmie Johnson Hi Karun, what do you make of allison returning as Technical director? Will he be the savior? Hi karun, your opinion about f1 pulling their streaming rights from India and only providing f1 tv being the only source to watch f1. Yo man. Over time it has been highly despressing to watch F1 as a Ferrari fan and especially as a Leclerc fan. What do you think he should do as the next move to bring himself to a level where Hamilton and Verstappen are? I highly feel he should leave Ferrari. Bhai, For becoming a F1 driver, Allen would be better or Aakash would be better. Would you agree that farcical finishes such as what happened at the Australian GP earlier this month are a by-product of the Netflix era, where manufacturing drama takes precedence over common sense and safety? (ending behind a safety car makes for bad television etc). Even so, surely the sensible thing to do with two laps to go would have been a rolling restart instead of a standing restart, which was quite frankly asking for the chaos that ensued at the end? As a long-time fan of the sport, I am deeply concerned about decisions such as these in recent times that seek to maximise drama at all costs. Do you see this trend reversing anytime soon? What's the best Simulation platform for translating it into real-life motorsports in your opinion? and what do you like(or if you dislike) about the simulation experience compared to real life? Hi Karun, hope you're doing great What do you think differentiates the BEST drivers from the others? Is it just a god-given talent that makes them stand apart or is there something anyone can work on hard enough to make it to the top? They're like all other professional sports people. Catch them at the right moment and they're great - catch them when it's going badly on track and you want to avoid them!! Hey karun I'm not Very familiar with f1 but in my engg cllg we have a formula car racing department which I aspire to join they compete SAE competitions i have a quiz and an interview coming up , how can I get myself up to join it.? Any sources or ways how i can learn or if you can give any tips would be helpful. Hi karun, Do you feel claustrophobic when you're in the F1 car?? Do you miss being in the car? How do you feel about income inequality in country? On on hand we have people who sleep hungry and on other hand we have people living in gated colonies watching these silly car races \"F1\" 🤓 whatever it is Sometimes! Hey Karun, what is your opinion about Baku's sprint? How is it benefit to the companies in regards of profit and about stress drivers have to carry additionally? Hi Karun! Would you be willing to address a bunch of engineering students enthusiastic about motorsports at BITS Pilani sometime in the later half of this year? Online ofcourse, given your busy schedule. Hi Karun! What do you think about the 2021 Abu Dhabi GP? As a driver, can you tell what you would've been feeling had you been in Lewis' place? What are your opinions on the Arjun Maini incident? Hey Karun! Just a light query . How do you assess the upcoming upgrades of the top-of-the-grid teams now that the actual paces of teams have been seen in the first three races? Also, do you hope in the near future that the Indian GP would make a return to the calendar? Hi Why has DTS been such a hit with new fans but the original fans are not happy with the direction the sport is heading into? Hey Karun! Heard you had some connection with Chennai too. Is that true? I do - but I'm fortunate to have found a great way to continue to be involved with F1 on a regular basis with Sky and also testing various F1 cars for Williams Never! How can I get into F1? Is 16 very late age to start? Or motorsports in general Hi Karun! I wanna know about your thoughts on the current F2 grid from this year. Who do you think is going to be the first to graduate to F1? My guess is it's going to be Pourchaire, but I'm interested to know about your take. explain your life in 4 words Kitna average deti hai bhai 😂 What does your home simulator setup look like? Ooo i see thank you so much for your response! What do you think of Ted Kravitz? What do I need to know about him to not think of him as painfully obnoxious? I think it's the ability to perform consistently. The great champions like Lewis, Max and Fernando are able to deliver in every session of every weekend. What is one thing that people have misconception about this sport? Wonderful to see you here, Karun. Fellow Chennai lad here. How do you look back on your own career? And of all the F1 cars you've driven, has there been any that you think you'd have maximised your potential in as a driver? Hello Karun, my friends are huge motorsport fans. Can you please reply to me so that i can flex on them . thank you Hello Karun, What do you think would be a better approach for an Indian Grand Prix? A new street circuit or go back racing at Budh? I'm sorry, could you please repeat the question? Personally I think ACC is the best in terms of the physics but iRacing is just easy to log on and play with your friends So with the McLaren's performing so underwhelming this year. What do you think went wrong on their side?And could we see them performing better in the upcoming races? Hi Karun! What are you thoughts on the future of Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes? We haven’t seen him dominate the track as much in 2 years now and Max makes it look too easy. Do you know he will ever be world champion again? When will F1 look towards the Indian market seriously? Not having a TV broadcast partner is ridiculous to be honest. Yo karun What mindset do you carry when you're competing to be at the top of the game? Hi Karun! Can you tell us a fun story about your interactions with F1 drivers? Alonso has such badass vibes and Max looks so focused all the time… how are they in real life? Hi Karun. Hope you are doing well. I am still amazed by wonderful achievement of becoming one of the world's best 20 racers for a year. How it felt like experiencing 4+ g forces while driving a formula car? Do women dig f1 drivers? Did you ever get rejected for a rishta because girls mom and dad thought that you do not have a fitting career? Hi Karun! Do you think Danny Ric has a chance of a comeback? If yes, which team do you think he should race for? I don't really have a problem with the standing start because I actually think the intention of having it is good for the show. The re-start in Baku with 2 laps to go a couple of years ago was great and gets everyone tuning in. On the final lap though, we should have just had a safety car that took everyone to the flag instead of that long wait for a final SC lap anyway. Hey Karun, Whats the toll a complete race takes on your body? How important is mental health in a season? whats the highest G force you have experienced while driving? Edit- never mind. I see you have already answered it before. Which cardiac biomarker is enzymatic as well as being specific and quickest Hey karun good to see you here man What was the toughest moment in your career Hi Karun, great to have you here! Just wanted your thoughts now that MotoGP and FE are/have come to India, when/if you see a return for F1? (Not necessarily to Buddh ofc). Thanks and wish you the best! 😄 Damn! 5G’s. That’s like a sukhoi doing a cobra pose Hi Karun About Mercedes. Rumours are rife that James Allison is back at Brackley. So how can he steer the Design and Engineering team different from Elliott.??? What gains in performance are you expecting in the coming months?? Thanks in advance Just so we're clear, F1 didn't pull their rights - they opened the bidding but none of the networks wanted to take the rights at a fair price because of their investment in Cricket. It's disappointing and I hope one of the broadcasters takes it up again soon! ohh, I would have thought of the two being completely the other way around. ACC being the easiest to log on and play with your friends. Also, if you don't find, what kind of braking feel do you prefer in simulation racing. any modifications etc you have done to get the perfect feel for the same? Can someone replicate what Brawn GP did in 2009? To me personally, their achievement trumps everything else - the cars and the team they had. My cousin won big betting on them that season and he talks about it all the time. He's a brilliant aerodynamiscist and engineer but also a very good leader. The timing of the move is critical as they are just starting work on the 2024 car. Idli or Dosa? MMSC Hi karun what are your views on the current state of f1 in terms of all the changes that are happening in the sport? Do you see Ferrari making a comeback this season and can you ask Yuki how's the future restaurant business looking for him. Hope you're doing well. Hi Karan, Do you think F1 will come back to india sometime ? Hi Karun, it’s great to have you here.. My question to you is, do you see Budh Circuit back on the calendar anytime soon? Big picture - ditch the hybrids, make the cars smaller and bring back loud screaming V10 engines running on e-fuels. Small picture - Don't allow tyre changes, repairs under red flags unless it's for safety. Have you ever tried playing computer racing games such as Need for Speed, Gran Turismo, Forza Horizon, or F1 games? If yes, how close are they compared to real racing? Also, why do we see so less F1 drivers from India? Considering a population of 1.45 billion, it's really bizarre that we don't get to see that many drivers from India. When was the last time you drove a car in Indian traffic? Still can do it? After all these years away? Both Jehan and Kush Maini are doing a good job in F2 but it's a tough step to make from there as there are a lot of other good drivers in the field also. I hope not! The human element is so important IMO. Depends on who ends up in a top car first but my guess would be Oscar... Hi Karan, Do you think 2026 regulations will affect the sport for drivers? Hey Karun! What's your opinion on Formula - E? Hi Karun, who do you think was the real winner of Abh Dhabi 2021? One and only time I saw F1 live was at Budh International Circuit in U.P., India. Hopefully it happens again. Would love to go see it. I think Max will just sneak ahead in Qualifying but have to battle hard to hold on to track position in the race!! Fernando can certainly win if Aston give him the tools to do it. Hi Karun, I just wanted to know what's your favourite car to drive? Thank you. Hi Karun, why is F1 such a male dominated sport? Understandable, i hope the fanbase in India grows, i thinks the moto gp in India will pull more attention to racing in India Hi Karun! Good to see you here :) my question to you is - how do you feel about the environment impact of F1 as a sport ? Are there any initiatives to create real change ? As a fan it’s hard to defend the waste of resources Hi Karun! Was there any race in your career where you felt so mentally exhausted/tired that you thought about just quitting that race right there, and take a break? I hope so - I think we saw a step change between when Narain and I started and when these guys have begun in the sport. For example, we never had any kart tracks or did a kart race before racing in single seaters whereas this generation has come through the Indian karting ladder. There are a bunch of new race and kart tracks planned for the country so we'll see what effect that has soon. My debut at Le Mans in 2012 - what an incredible event that is! Hey Karun, what are your interests/hobbies outside of F1? It’s 2035. Where is Karun Chandhok? I do - I enjoyed the second season the most I think. Thanks! >Thanks! You're welcome! What were you and Sachin Tendulkar talking about during the Instagram photo you posted? What are your thoughts about Jehan Daruvala? When do you think he will get a F1 seat? Hey Karun, What's your favorite racing circuit? Cycling! I think it's a fascinating strategic contest with a huge human effort required from the riders. I would say Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal - to perform at the highest level for so many years is remarkable. Hey Karun, big fan, always point out to my parents that it's you when you come up on TV. Anyways Which Indian driver do you think is most likely to end up in F1 in the near future. Also which comes first, an Indian Driver, Race or a Team?? Thanks again wet weather races or dry weather races? When you are a driver in the race, which would you prefer? Hi. I only have one question that is, what skills / trainings i have to get through to be able to qualify as a F1 racer thanks. What is the most awkward moment in your life? Hi Karan, What is your opinion on the stint of Force India in F1. What were the best things about it. What wasn't that great. Also what needs to be done in terms of tech/economic advancement for an Indian auto conglomerate like Tata to be part of F1/F2 I don't think it's got anything to do with the passport, rather the opportunities created by location. The sport is primarily based in the UK and Europe and therefore access to the sport from an early stage is harder for people in India. Hi karan when will proper Grand Prix racing start in India, what r the plans of fmsci, what is ur lap time at MMRT. Karun can you pls ask Modiji when are we getting the Indian grand prix back?? Hi Karun, what are your thoughts about the rumor about Leclerc going to Mercedes after his term at Ferrari? Hi Karun!! What are your thoughts on Budh International Circuit, the race track in India and also the track which witnessed Vettel's dominance... And how is the ranking of India in terms of fan bases compared to earlier times? GLHF on your commentary :D I'm team F1! Just want to see great races. I hope we get the Indian GP back sometime soon but it needs the government to jump on board like other countries have done. It doesn't make financial sense for any private business to take on the cost of the event. hi Karun everyone is asking about racing but I wanted to ask about your life.Other than racing how are you, how is your health, is F1 treating you well. And out of curiosity which is your favourite road car.? HI KARUN!!! non F1 related question What are your favorite movies so far? Your favourite tracks to drive in and your favourite track outside of the f1 calendar Hi Karun, What are your thoughts on the rising costs of competing in single seaters? Are the cost caps effective, or do we need to do more to keep the lower rungs of the sport accessible? Hey Karun, Some advice for the young ones who want to pursue their career as a F1 driver! If one from India wants to pursue a career in Motorsport, what age would be ideal to start and how should one go about it? How much weight you loose during race? In the rain, it happens a lot! Imagine you're rocking your chair back and forth in a school class room. There's that moment when you nearly fall over and you get that shock feeling all through your body when you catch it. Now imagine that at every corner of a wet race!! Hi Karun! What is your most memorable moment off the track during one of the race weekends? Also, who do you think has the most potential from the current F2 grid? I just used to cut myself off from the outside world as much as possible. Talk to as few people as possible, read very little news and just focus on the job with my engineers and mechanics. Hi Karun, What do you think of the Maini Brothers Making it to F1 ? Hi Karun, Love that you're part of the team! I enjoy hearing your thoughtful and well reasoned takes/analysis of the on track action. 1. How did you get started in commentary? Was it something you planned for or just a happy accident? And what are your favourite and least favourite (but not necessarily bad) things about the job? 2. Outside of F1 what are your favourite track/road cars you've driven? Hi Karun, Kudos for the work you do on sky sports. Top notch stuff ! The current crop of racers in F1 (last 2-3 years) literally pace their race like robots. They hit the exact time that they are asked to, and make maybe just a mistake or two all race. Do you think in the pre turbo hybrid era, the consistency of racers accross the field was this high ? Or are these current gen racers so good that they really gel with the cars so well . Hey. How do you spend your weekends? Which Indian talent has the best chance to get into f1? Any chance india fould restart F1 in Budh Circuit. Hi Karun! Which former F1 circuit would you like to see in the F1 calendar? Yeah that right tho Wish her all the very best! Raising the funding to compete is hardest thing, especially in India. Ultimately results speak for themselves - when I started I had no sponsors but I won the Indian racing championship in my first year that secured some backing from JK Tyres. I then won the first 5 races of the Formula Asia championship which helped to attract more backing. If you're not competitive - man or woman - it's hard to get anyone to invest. Hey Karun ! Just got F1TV in India. Which races would you say are a must watch ? Also can you please recommend some good books on motorsport ? PS - Love your commentary ! And realised the other day that your brother is doing the IPL shows. You two are great ! All else equal, whose faster, Narain or you? Hi Karun!! Great to have you here. Who do you think are the WDC contenders for this season and why? Also who's your current favourite driver and favourite team? Btw huge fan can he make to F1? Another question, what are your thoughts on 250cc superkarts? I see videos of these in the UK and Australia but would love to drive one. LISSTEN TO MY CALLS SAMIR Hey! I have a question: How difficult was it to make it to international motorsports and F1 being born and raised in india? Hi, hope you are doing well. How did you go about making changes to the layout of tracks?? Yas Marina has improved a lot after the changes a few years back despite the final sector being kinda meh with the hotel preventing any changes to it. What infrastructure does India need for young f1 drivers.. Thank you Hey karun, What do you think about sim racing? Can we see it being popular in India and if so as we've seen on other places that people transition from sim to IRL , can we see that happening in India. Also if you sim race , can we ever join you ? Lot's of people ask me about AD 2021... I was in the commentary box with Martin Brundle and David Croft. It was a super intense season and when that final SC came out and Mercedes opted to stay out, I knew Max would pit for new tyres. To be honest, I expected the lapped cars to all stay in position between Lewis and Max and I think that would have been the fair way to settle it. Max would have passed the lapped cars by turn 9 but Lewis would have had a 2 second advantage by then and that would have set up a spectacular battle in the final few corners! I was surprised and disappointed that some of the lapped cars were allowed to go around because it made it predictable that Max would pass Lewis. Hi karun.. are you friends with Charles Leclerc? 🙈 Hi Karun, what do you think about F1 would be regionalisation of calendar have effects on drivers and team generally? Where & what do you feel is the big difference between the Asian and European drivers when we compare their driving abilities? for example Pierre Gasly vs Yuki Tsunoda Hi Karun. Your views on Kush Maini so far and what cars do you own? Hi Karun, what in your opinion would be the biggest surprise of the 2023 season? Thanks! Love your commentary and the technical info you provide! Who is your favourite non WDC driver from the 2000s ? Do you have a favourite driver pairing from that time? For me it's Ralf and JPM Hi Karun! Do you think Max would ever got bored and just leave F1 for something else? Max comes of as such a racing nerd, someone who loves the act of racing so much that even the sport of F1 itself is secondary to the art form of racing for him. Max has hinted before that he would leave F1 if he's not enjoying it anymore. If hypothetically the RB dominance continues till his contract ends, do you see him leaving F1? How's your F1 Fantasy team doing? Hi Karun, do you think Mazepin was over-hated? Did lack of Indian racers in Force India F1 team, fail to create an impact among the casual fans of F1 in India. What did you go through to become a F1 driver and can I be a F1 driver 🤔 too ? The Jimmie pick is definitely intriguing. His only real open-wheel experience came after he retired from NASCAR and went to Indy in his mid-40s. He did well at some of the oval races but was usually lingering at the back at traditional circuits. He wasn’t really known to be much of a “road course ringer” in NASCAR either. Not to say that couldn’t have succeeded in F1, but I would probably take some other NASCAR drivers such as Kyle Larson, AJ Allmendinger, or maybe even Austin Cindric before Jimmie Hii Karun, great to see you here. What is your favourite race you ever watched? What made that race your favorite? What is your unbiased opinion on Abu Dhabi 2021? Ignoring the results, was the race director in the wrong to call in the safety car too soon. Hi Karan! What's the most tough decision that you've made as a driver? whose your least fav driver right now Tune in to the races in Baku this weekend!!! F1 is still the ultimate pinacle of our sport but I enjoy working on the FE weekends as I am friends with a lot of the drivers and people in the paddock Suzuka, Silverstone, Le Mans and Monaco No!! Hey Karun, Spa or Monza, which one do you like better and why? Yes he’s fantastic. Why do you think elliot failed? He has the same skillset as allison, especially aerodynamics Hi Karun Do you think if FIA allows to challenge past results now, would it resolve some of the most curious what ifs in F1 or will it be a nuisance? 👀 My grandmother's family were from Lahore but the Chandhok's were from Kashmir I believe. Hello Karun, Do you feel that there is any more improvement in the racing industry as the introduction of AI can cause significant impact in the driving skills required. And is there any other racer who you look/ed up to? What do you think of Ayrton Senna ? Oh yeah. Lots of Chandhoks used to live in Punjabi-speaking parts of Azad Kashmir/Mirpur regions as well hey, how does it feel to be in a tense moment in a race? cheers mate How is the Nanoli Speedway coming along? Are you still involved in that project? I think in general it's hard to go back on technology although I would say in general the cars have now got too many electronic adjustment options on them because of the hybrid systems. I don't have a problem with the communication but I think if we get rid of the hybrids it would make the cars less complex, lighter and smaller so better for racing. Is your schedule more hectic now as a pundit than it was as an f1 driver? Yes... I have known Narain since I was 9 years old. I visited him in the UK to watch him race in F3 on a few occassions and we have spent a lot of time together. There were certainly moments where external pressures from the media and sponsors made our relationship strained and there were times where we didn't get along but on the whole, we always respected each others abilities and today I would say we are friends and proud members of the exclusive club of 2 in 1.4 billion! Hi Karun, not a question but just wanted to point out we’re related lol When will Ferrari fix their car/strat team if ever? 😭 Hi Karun, So glad to have you here! I wanted to know what your thoughts are about what happened in Abu Dhabi in the final race of 2021 where it boiled down to become a one lap race between Max and Lewis, after the safety car mess. What do you think FIA needs to do to prevent such situations from reoccurring in the future? Very interesting! Thanks for the AmA. Hi Karun, I'm curious to get your thoughts on racing at Buddh International. Has the idea of hosting events such as F2, F3, F1 Academy, or even Formula Regional Asia been considered. I have wished for an \"Asian GP\" similar to European GP with a rotating calendar of Sepang, Korea, India, Fuji, and any other circuit that is looking to bid to host F1! Hi Karun, Imagine if F1 came back to India to a street circuit. Which one would it be? How much physics knowledge do drivers have to work with? Your review of application of data in strategy for teams? Ah very fair answer! Thank you for taking the time to answer x Give me an award Dear Karun I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you with a burning question that has been on my mind for a while. As an F1 racer, I am sure you are the best person to answer this question. What qualifications does one need to become an F1 racer, and how does one go about getting into F1 racing? Kindly answer this questions Lmao Hey Karun, what cars do you enjoy driving outside of F1? hey karun when do you think mercedes can catch up if the upgrades in baku works considering red bull has disadvantage of wind tunnel time testing? also which is your favorite f1 car? That was a robbery Hello Karun Sir, hope you are doing well. out of so many options as career what got you into f1!?, especially being an indian Have been a great follower of you and this adrenaline sports. How do I get your autographed car replica? Hi karun Do you have any favourites from the current lot of f1 drivers? Hi Karun! Who do you think is the fastest driver in F1 today if the constructor / engine was not a factor? Could India be a destination of note for Formula E? Thanks for the answer, and thanks to autocorrect for fudging up your name 😬 Kitna mileage deti hai ? Sir please tell me your one beautiful school memory Do you think the FIA should actively work towards making cars smaller 2026 onwards. We got the best wheel to wheel racing pre 2017, since then the cars despite getting faster have become like boats. Maybe focus towards making barriers more shock absorbent than relying on broad and heavy crash structures around the cockpit? Did you do this with Karthikeyan AMA too ? Will Kush maini or Jehan have still chance to F1, Kush is showing some solid performance this season. He should atleast gt some in F1 academy Hey Karun, what are the chances of either Daruvala or Maini going to F1? Do you believe in Aston Martin's Godalonso's hypetrain? Great answer Karun Did he leave out Horner on purpose? True. Jimmie Johnson was solid in ovals most notably at Texas Motor Speedway last year but the road courses were super rough. Even at his Nascar cameo in COTA it was unfortunate he was DNF'd in the opening laps What's your take on the new race weekend format for Azerbaijan? Are you in favor of Sprint qualifying? Have you ever been in a jet boat? That's the highest G experience I've ever had. Truly otherworldly experience. I can't even imagine a F1 car. Christian has been TP at Red Bull for its entire time in F1. He means him no disrespect, I'm sure. Bwoah Yessss CSK massive. He did.. This is a meme on r/cricket Knowledgeable Chennai Crowd™. Btw did you kart or race during your sishya days? I remember the mammens arranged to take some sections to sriperambadur every once in a while. How about controlling a space ship? r/formula1 Brit living in the US. I really enjoy your commentary on the F1 feed. Keep it up! Hey Karun, do you think Charles and Russell would be a beneficiary combo for Mercedes in future (e.g: 2026,2027) ?? But there's a difference between experiencing 5 G's ina linear fashion as opposed to the vertical G forces experienced in a fighter? Max Verstappen crossed 51 Gs laterally during a crash Karun! I never thought I'd have a medium to directly say hi. I just wanted you to know that I think your contributions to F1 commentary are astounding, and I hope you're fulfilling a dream by doing it! Keep up the great work! Cheers from California I mean, it's a very famous copypasta... Who is the driver u find rooting for the most? How bad is the politics in F1? Bro, Do U think Kush Maini Has A Chance? HE IS DRIVING MEGA. I missed this AMA but that's alright. Just wanted to say I'm a big fan of yours! It was great watching you and narain in the F1 circuit. I'm not following f1 actively anymore. I also have a picture with you from my first BAJA competition all the way back in 2010-11! Glad that i was able to recognize you ! :) Yes but Narain didnt answer the question unfortunately THALA moment Hey , which is the best college to pursue motorsport engineering in india?? Asking for myself. Whats the money like in F1? Did F1 mess up not having a broadcast and streaming partner in India and relying solely on F1 TV? kaun hai bhai yeh Why Ferrari is a meme? Hi Karun, it is an pleasure interacting with you! Just one thing, how does that initial acceleration feels in a F1 car? If I want to compare it with something which will be the best? Hi karun I was wondering what were some cool and quirky cars that you have had the chance to drive and hoon around in. Hi karun, what do feel about jehan's future TFAR You dog 😂 F1 driver banke sax sux mila? Just wanna say I love your commentary He races in f2 and is in fe as a reserve driver it was karma Then max will get karma for driving like a drunk man in india...maybe vegetable state coming soon😂😂 whatever the right guy won in the end. No he didn't....rules weren't followed... Whats ur favourite race? Hi Karun, Do you ever think about returning to racing or maybe join F1 as Team Principal,Engineer etc?"
