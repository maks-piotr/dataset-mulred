    "selftext": "The below is mostly a rant. \n\nI am really elated that we won this world cup. It was such a last minute thriller and we finally were able to pull this off. I danced and shouted when we won. It gave some solace to the WC final we lost against Australia. The entire celebration we had initially for the first 2 days made all the sense. \n\n  \nBut, I feel now, we are overdoing the celebrations and somewhat exaggerating the win. Here are my reasons;\n\n1. **Cricket Overdose:** T20 world cup happens every 2nd year. There is 50 over every 4 years, IPL and test. In the last 3 years, there have been 3 World Cups (2 T20 and 1 50 over) and 3 IPL seasons. I already forgot who won IPL last year. A new bilateral series is already underway. There is a VERY heavy overdose of cricket.  \n\n\n2. **Tax Payer's Loss:** BCCI is giving 125 Crores to these players. [Maharashtra government giving 11 crores to already super rich players](https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/maharashtra-government-announces-rs-11-crore-prize-money-for-t20-world-cup-winning-indian-team-cm-eknath-shinde-1700543#:~:text=Maharashtra%20Government%20Announces%20Rs%2011,Indian%20Team%20CM%20Eknath%20Shinde). Even though BCCI is a private entity, I am pretty sure somewhere or the other it is our honest taxpayers' money being siphoned through to these players.\n\n3. **Unnecessary Fandom:** Modi went and facilitated the players. The whole Wankhede was assembled to congratulate the players. A roadshow was taken out to celebrate the victory. Each government invited players and facilitated them. We will start seeing more of these cricketers coming in ads now. I know every single player in the team, even those who sat on bench. I do not know 3 players from hockey and football.\n\n",

        "I don't know why the T20 World Cup is being made such a big deal. It is held every 2 years and the competition is between 5 teams. Every country is bound to win it once every decade or so. India did the same. I don't understand the hype and celebration like it's the greatest sports achievement ever.",
        "even though i dislike cricket and think its boring af but whats the problem in celebrating a victory? when argentina does it  its cool but when indians do the same theres a problem. Thats straight up hypocricy .",

I am pretty sure others would be fed up too if there was just too many football versions going on. \n\nIf India would have won 50 over cricket, yes. That is a big deal. Happens every 4 years. But T20 World Cup just ain't it.",
        "Trophy parades happen everywhere. It's a completely normal thing. Just watch Argentina's trophy parade after they won the FIFA World Cup in 2022.\n\nCricket is the probably the only sport where we can have such kinds of celebrations.",
        "No it isn't",
        "Exactly. Not paying tax on their income equates to siphoning off taxpayers's money.",
        "1. They pay for the police protection \n2. The players have to pay taxes on the amounts received. \n3. BCCI does pay taxes in form of GST etc when the tickets are sold, I think in 2021-22 which is the last financial report released they paid some ~1,100 in taxes. \n4. BCCI is a sporting body which like all sports bodies is exempt from Income tax due to promotion of sports purposes - being exempt is different &\nNot paying taxes is different.",

        "1. We celebrated winning the World Cup and not playing the World Cup so saying that it happens every 2nd year is not related to the opinion. What is the issue if we have different formats for the game?\n\n2. Agree with the state announcing rewards but BCCI giving away 125 cr is irrelevant here.\n\n3. Never heard football-dominated nations talk about why football is popular compared to other sports in their country. If people love cricket then what is the problem? You are talking about the victory parade and unnecessary fandom, well we have won the World Cup and it should be celebrated.\n\nI don't think it is being exaggerated. Yes, we need to promote other sports and events like the Olympics but saying this win is exaggerated is not justified.",
        "Bro I was really happy that day. I was overjoyed that we won. As a country. After all these years. We should celebrate. I just don't like so much being overspent on already super rich cricketers.",

        "If you dont understand why people are celebrating the win you dont understand sports and you most probably never will.Why hate on other people's enjoyment?This feeling that you are intellectually superior for not enjoying sports is stupid.Let people enjoy and get some happiness what's the point of life if you keep on focusing on the negatives of things",

        "So there is no proof they pay for police protection?",
        "I am also happy that India won and of course victories should be celebrated, but I didn't think that the t20 world cup was such a huge deal. I always felt that the ODI wc was the real deal. Maybe most people are coping with this win after we lost on the 19th.\nPS. imagine what will happen if India wins the ODI wc lmao",
        "I have no concern on them enjoying sports. I have myself enjoyed the win thoroughly. I have a concern of my tax money being spent on the already rich cricketers.",
        "People should be allowed to celebrate. We are a cricket crazy nation and cricket is one of the few sports where we can have these extravagant celebrations. The era of Rohit, Virat, etc., is soon coming to an end so this victory was more special. \n\nHowever, I do agree that Maha gov giving already rich af cricketers 11 crores is unnecessary. I also think the roadshow celebrations could have been better regulated though.",

        "Doesn’t Fifa happen once in 5yrs? You won’t hear about Football right now.",
        "Unfortunately, Cricket is the only sport where India can exercise its soft power.

So some over-hype may be necessary.",
        "BCCI does not operate like other events. And that is why all babus and co get free tickets and passes etc. I can guarantee you BCCI pays a pittance for the state resources they consume. Or in many cases none at all.",
        "Whatever has been done at grassroots level for football, its nowhere close to what needs to be done if you want to be successful in the sport. See the other Asian countries and the amount of investment they've done in football compared to us. And if body structure was an issue, the likes of South Korea, Japan shouldn't have been performing the way they are.",
        "Cricket overdose is true. Its like 3 matches every week nowadays & with ipl its 2 matches per day for 2 months. Lost interest in cricket long time back due to same reason.",
        "Nobody is saying not to celebrate, what OP is saying is that it's going overboard. Like an overdose of a drug for mindless fans whose lives will not improve in any way, but the players will get crores of rupees and their Insta gloating will start soon.",

This diminishes the prestige of an ICC tournament especially world cups.

        "FIFA World Cup is a very different thing from T20 World Cup. It is not even the ODI World Cup. There seems to be a T20 World Cup every 2 years, and T20 is the lowest rung of cricket skillwise. It is a good achievement but does not warrant such over-the-top celebrations. Unfortunately, T20 cricket is the opium of Indian people, and given what is happening elsewhere, they cannot be blamed for using this drug.",
        "Ok bro. Have a nice day :)",
        "Fuck off bro let people enjoy",
        "BCCI does not hire anybody for anything. \n\n1. If it’s a bilateral series, the state association which is hosting the match is responsible for all payments to all vendors including security etc, BCCI will not be the one making payments. \n2. In IPL, the teams hire the police and pay for it. Again BCCI will not be the one making the payment. \n\nThis is pretty much how any national governing body anywhere in the world operates.",
        "Let people post on Reddit. Tujhe nahi padhna toh mat padh.",
        "But BCCI should not be exempt from tax! It is a money-making giant that does not need any incentives, which rather should go towards other sports and educational activities (or some grassroots cricket clubs not under the ambit of BCCI, if one wants to spend on cricket only).",
        "The whole celebrations got extended cuz the team was stuck in a hurricane. Or else we wouldn't have had a week full of celebrations.",
        "There is FIFA World Cup which happens every 4 years like you said and also Euros/Copa every 4 years. ( so even in football, every two years they have a big and prestigious tournaments happening) Just like we have ODI/T20 every 2 years.",
        "Same thing happens on every sport 🤦",
        "I dont understand why this world cup is every two years instead of 4. Its like sooner or later india is going to win it. Theres nothing to celebrate the way we’ve gone overboard",

        "Same here...I enjoyed the victory immensely and celebrated that night. Next day it was business as usual.\nSure, felicitate the players but this open top parade and endless celebrations for a WC which happens every 2 years is going overboard. Putting cricketers on such a pedestal, that no wonder why other sports are so marginalized.",
        "That's my biggest issue, it's good that we are rewarding people who won the world cup, but come on, if we spent a fraction of that money on sports like football, table tennis, badminton and others, we would have so much more success in other sports as well",
        "I feel the opposite about money... Bcci makes a ton of money and it is giving them pennies in comparison.. The world cup we lost to Australia in 2003,the players got around 7-8 crores each ... On losing! \n\nHere they are giving them the same, after winning, 20 years, later... Its just that they sneakily announced it as a lumpsum so it seems like a lot\n\nBy normal common man standards 8-10 crores is a lot... But given what the bcci earns from the players, it's really less..",
        "We also have Asia cup which is equivalent to Euros/Copa. So not a direct comparison. Also the EURO and Copa are not conducted by FIFA. All the formats are conducted by ICC though.",
        "BCCI spends money on cricket. The amount of facilities that now exists is phenomenal compared to 20 years back. That’s how much they’ve poured back into the sport.\n\nThey’re only exempt from income tax, they pay GST & stuff.",
        "If you don't know 3 players from hockey and football then whose mistake it is?\nCentral govt or state govt?\nThe government will follow where there is a crowd and the crowd is certainly with  Cricket and cricketers.\n\nFor me cricket is another sport and I did follow other sports as well like all olympic sports and Hockey, football as well. \n\nIf we change the govt stance will also change for sure.",

        "Dude, are you mad? This is India. We are talking about Cricket! \nKinda sad that you're getting downvoted everywhere on the post, even after you've clearly said it's an **\"Unpopular Opinion\"**. My take on this whole parade is - \"Woh dekho sone ki chidya\", and we aren't even focused on what's happening in the country.\n\nIt's like that dialogue from the Tejaswini movie \"Cricket Dekho Cricket\"  https://youtu.be/90376T1gj1A?si=sRecxUKDaG6Di7RL\n\nOn top of that, the amount of money that our governments are giving to the players is insanely unnecessary. BCCI announced a prize money of ₹125,00,00,000 to the team.\n\nMaharashtra is under a debt of approximately 80,00,00,00,00,000 and they want to award 11,00,00,000 to the Indian Cricket Team. Cricket Dekho Cricket! Zeroes ginne me adha time chala ja raha hai, and we are simply showering money on the players like they're some lap dancers at a strip club. *WTF is that economy rate (4.17) of Bumrah in the IPL and what a superb innings by Virat Kohli, glad to Hardik Pandya turn his image around considerably.* Cricket Dekho Cricket!! The players deserve our respect, but not our tax money. Train accidents are getting more and more common, people are dying due to climate changes and destruction of forests and fragile ecosystems. *But, what a beautiful speech by Rohit Sharma, I think he definitely deserves the spot to be captain, and a lovely handover from the legend Dhoni to Kholi to Rohit.* Cricket Dekho Cricket!! Vigilante groups are getting more and more power, and a lot of minorities from North to South, East to West are getting beaten up or killed or whipped. Manipur is burning on one side. Woh dekho, sone ki chidya! Either way, we have our Desh ka Ladla ka wedding coming up, so the nation is geared towards covering that without missing a beat. We have so much to look forward to!",

        "We have Holi and Diwali every year, but does it ever really take away the excitement?Cricket has become a cultural obsession. Every culture has something similar that fosters unity, love, and a sense of belonging. \n\nThe insane amount of money cricket generates for the economy cannot be understated. From uncles and 12-year-old children getting into the hobby and spending money on expensive bats to pizza delivery guys benefiting from increased business, cricket brings money, work, and greater opportunities.\n\nSecondly, we have no concrete evidence to support some claims. Although I 100% agree that the politicization of these players and the close ties of political entities with the BCCI, especially with Amit Shah's son being its chairman, definitely reeks of corruption. The players are unlikely to object to being billboards for politicians and Modi, but I doubt they could, given the government's tight control over the BCCI. I doubt a player could openly criticize Modi without facing professional consequences beyond the expected backlash from the public.\n\nWe can claim that the amount of money from the government is excessive, and this is true. But there are different types of wealthy individuals, from oil barons and loan sharks to athletes and actors. Whatever your opinions of the rich, I would argue that sportsmen, especially cricketers, who are productive both economically and culturally, deserve their wealth. Maybe not government money, given the existing poverty, but they deserve to be rich more than many other professions.\n\nWe should be cautious about this situation and discuss the excessive publicity blitz by politicians. I genuinely believe the collusion between the BCCI and political entities borders on outright corruption. These players are private individuals representing Team India, not politicians or the government. It's insane how the BJP and others intend to squeeze all the attention capital they can out of these players. In a country like America, you could openly question athletes for their support of certain politicians and their political advocacy and or support For example, look at how many times people like LeBron James have had to answer for their support to things. It's expected there, but not in India. \n\nHere, it would be considered very rude and unnecessary to ask such questions, although at some level it is justified, not every player has control over this, they might have to do a lot of things they don't want to, for the sake of their future But there is a genuine question to be asked regarding the benefits players receive from supporting certain things For example, people raked Ronaldo over the coals for his decision to take blood money from middle East with connections to a monarch. I would definitely ask some of the rich and established players what they think of the awful actions committed by the politicians they associate with and accept money from. However, I also doubt these players have the freedom to be individuals due to the corruption I mentioned earlier..\n\nRegarding the hockey situation, it's genuinely sad. Hockey players deserve more money and effort from the government. However, cricket and hockey are very different sports. Cricket breached the cultural consciousness long before it became this huge. Perhaps one day I'll read enough about both sports to explain it, but I don't know why hockey hasn't gained the same traction despite movies and other efforts to promote it. Sometimes it feels like wrestling and kabaddi have overtaken hockey in cultural relevance.",

        "The question should be: Do you watch women sports? I bet you don't even watch sports at all.",
        "Agree with you OP",
        "Not to comment on prize money given by BCCI. It's the boards money. But i dont think it makes much sense for state governments to give players more cash on top of that. Feels like pouring water in an already filled pot.",
        "It is for every sport federation, people are being very reactionary but it is not just that they have to pay 15-20 players, there are 38 ranji teams in India, cricket season is almost 8-10 months. Bcci supports them too, ( they hardly receive eyeballs to be self sustainable), there are n number of other domestic leagues, and all the player are paid handsomely, so even if someone doesn't play nationals they still can live comfortably. And bcci do donate to other sports federation.",
        "Yes. Had a brainfart.",
        "Totally agree with you.   \nGreat job, India, but this is a sport competitively played by only a handful of countries.   \nNow, succeed in a sport that bears more prestige on a global scale!",
        "You said all that but how bcci is paying 125cr to players?, isn't that ignoring all those domestic leagues and matches",
        "FINALLY A COMMENT THAT I TRULY RESONATE WITH. People are saying 'India is a behemoth in cricket out of 5 or 6 nations that play seriously' as if that's a bad thing. It's like saying the US should stop playing American Football or Ice Hockey or Baseball because they're one of 2 or just the only nation that plays those sports seriously. \n\nAnd don't tell me they don't hype up Baseball or the NFL (American Football league). The Super Bowl (NFL final) is literally the biggest sporting event in North America. Millions watch it, from Mexico to Canada. \n\nWe should be proud of our own beautiful game and continue to strive for excellence in it.",

        "What? If you don't know about something perhaps the best course of action is to be silent rather than spewing nonsense. \n\n\nThey pay in lakhs (1-5 lakhs)for each match in this league to each player, then there are manager coaches and what not.",
        "I'm not talking about the prestige of a club or Country.. I'm talking about the prestige of the competition / trophy. \n\nWhen you say FIFA WC, you see the the 94 years of history, It's importance, remember great players like Pele, Maradona, Zidane, Cruyff. There's value to winning that trophy\n\nWhen you say ICC ODI Cricket WC, you see 49 years of history and great players like Tendulkar, Kapil dev, Viv Richards etc.  There's value for winning that trophy\n\nSure, T20 would be considered prestigious , somewhere 15-20 years down the line when it has gained some history. Right now it's just a worse format of cricket played 2 yearly and has as much relevance as the UEFA nations league. The fact that you compared T20 to Copa and Euro's makes me laugh.",
        "GST is paid by the viewers buying tickets. BCCI merely transmits it to the government.  \n\nBut it’s wrong to say BCCI pays taxes. It pays no direct tax on income and it transmits indirect tax.",
        "To sach na bolun bhai? Har chauthey din news me hota kuch aur perpetuators hmare yaha aram se ghumte elections me ladte",
        "I think there is a Champions Trophy scheduled for 2025. ICC doesn't always act on MCC recommendations, especially in these times when it just wants to make as much money as possible, sometimes even wanting to kill the hen with the golden egg.",
        "You forgot Champions Trophy which is going to take place in 2025. Every year there is something. You have also forgotten the WTC finals.",
        "A sport in which USA can beat Pakistan, you call that as competitive? Yes, if you are saying that anyone can beat anyone. In that sense, of course, very competitive. But T20 is a format in which the difference between low and high quality becomes less, even ordinary players can do very well. That is not some purist opinion: that is a fact. You have the same resources but playing for a significantly shorter time: temperament and skills cannot be tested fully.",
        "If it is the opium of the people, of course it is the most popular form of cricket in India! In countries like England and Australia, Tests continue to be the most popular form of cricket. But whatever be the format of cricket that is popular, cricket serves as an opium in those countries where people otherwise have little to cheer in the world of sport and also have other problems in their lives. Hence, the craze in all of Indian subcontinent: the craze in Nepal and Bangladesh is even more than in India!\n\n  \nThere is nothing purist about the fact that in T20 you can achieve big things even with ordinary skills.",
        "Ah shit. I am the wrong one here. I thought I was replying to that woman.",
        "I deliberately didn't mention those 2 events because they weren't even needed. But thanks for bringing them out.",
        "should have worded my comment better. I meant that the amount of attention and funding that cricket receives is a little too much, and more of those funds should be directed to other sports",
        "For something that happens every year, it cannot be the same value as something that happens every 4 years. In cricket, a global tournament is happening every year, whereas in football a global tournament happens every four years.",
        "Of course, and yet BCCI loves them, because a lot of people do watch the India-Pakistan match in it.",
        "I definitely understand the sentiment. Just saying even if the government didn't award them it wouldn't make much difference. \n\nBut there are other places where this money will definitely make a difference. Awards cricketers is about optics not practicality. Public money should be spent where it makes a difference most but sadly optics becomes more important.",
        "They wanted to milk money, this is why we have reserve day only for ind pak match in aisa cup",
        "No ones asking US to stop playing but if they played baseball and won against 5 other countries who hardly take the sport as seriously as the US, they will never do such an over the top celebration. T20 World Cup is played every 2 years for fucks sake the way we’re celebrating it’s like we won 5 in a row.",
        "How many teams compete for the champions league and how difficult is to get qualified for it?",
        "Both those countries on average have a similar build in terms of height and body mass as us. Infact, we have more diversity due to a more diverse gene pool (north, north east, south etc). Diet is something which can be controlled and managed for players from a young age, if the proper amount of focus is given to other sports, similar to cricket. If you were to go by bodytype, Neeraj Chopra won Olympic gold in a sport we were nowhere in the running forbeating out heavyweights from Europe and the US. Why? Because he got proper coaching, funding and the right environment to succeed in. This mindset of its not possible from people like you, is the reason why we don't have success in the international arena",

        "There is one fifa world cup that happens every 4 years, more than 175 countries play qualification before 30 odd teams got selected for the 2022 world cup. The craze and the adminstration of football is spread across all the continents. Cricket on the other hand is just an Indian sport administratively and financially. The whole tournament from scheduling to venue selection is made as per the wishes of Indian team. India was the only team to know which venue they would play the semis at, even before the tournament started. Such biased administration isn't there in football. Plus think of it since 2019 i.e last 5 years there have been 2 odi WCs, 3 t20 WCs and 2 test world cup, so overall 7 WCs in 5 years. So NO, Argentina winning the WC is not the same as India winning a T20 WC."

different types wealthy individuals oil barons loan sharks athletes actors whatever opinions rich would argue sportsmen especially cricketers productive economically culturally deserve wealth maybe government money given existing poverty deserve rich many professions cautious situation discuss excessive publicity blitz politicians genuinely believe collusion bcci political entities borders outright corruption players private individuals representing team india politicians government insane bjp others intend squeeze attention capital players country like america could openly question athletes support certain politicians political advocacy support example look many times people like lebron james answer support things expected india would considered rude unnecessary ask questions although level justified every player control might lot things dont want sake future genuine question asked regarding benefits players receive supporting certain things example people raked ronaldo coals decision take blood money middle east connections monarch would definitely ask rich established players think awful actions committed politicians associate accept money however also doubt players freedom individuals due corruption mentioned earlier regarding hockey situation genuinely sad hockey players deserve money effort government however cricket hockey different sports cricket

    "light_cleaned_title": "Unpopular Opinion: The T20 World Cup Celebration is going way overboard",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "The below is mostly a rant. I am really elated that we won this world cup. It was such a last minute thriller and we finally were able to pull this off. I danced and shouted when we won. It gave some solace to the WC final we lost against Australia. The entire celebration we had initially for the first 2 days made all the sense. But, I feel now, we are overdoing the celebrations and somewhat exaggerating the win. Here are my reasons; 1. **Cricket Overdose:** T20 world cup happens every 2nd year. There is 50 over every 4 years, IPL and test. In the last 3 years, there have been 3 World Cups (2 T20 and 1 50 over) and 3 IPL seasons. I already forgot who won IPL last year. A new bilateral series is already underway. There is a VERY heavy overdose of cricket. 2. **Tax Payer's Loss:** BCCI is giving 125 Crores to these players. [Maharashtra government giving 11 crores to already super rich players](https://news.abplive.com/sports/cricket/maharashtra-government-announces-rs-11-crore-prize-money-for-t20-world-cup-winning-indian-team-cm-eknath-shinde-1700543#:~:text=Maharashtra%20Government%20Announces%20Rs%2011,Indian%20Team%20CM%20Eknath%20Shinde). Even though BCCI is a private entity, I am pretty sure somewhere or the other it is our honest taxpayers' money being siphoned through to these players. 3. **Unnecessary Fandom:** Modi went and facilitated the players. The whole Wankhede was assembled to congratulate the players. A roadshow was taken out to celebrate the victory. Each government invited players and facilitated them. We will start seeing more of these cricketers coming in ads now. I know every single player in the team, even those who sat on bench. I do not know 3 players from hockey and football.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I agree with all points except BCCI money. I don't think BCCI is given or even needs tax payers' money. BCCI has shit ton of money. There are states in India that have populations greater than 10 other countries that are competing with India. Why is it such a big deal that we win at a game which is statistically most likely to be played by Indians? If anything, we should be pointing out the fact that how the hell are we not winning every Cricket World Cup in existence, given our population? I don't know why the T20 World Cup is being made such a big deal. It is held every 2 years and the competition is between 5 teams. Every country is bound to win it once every decade or so. India did the same. I don't understand the hype and celebration like it's the greatest sports achievement ever. even though i dislike cricket and think its boring af but whats the problem in celebrating a victory? when argentina does it its cool but when indians do the same theres a problem. Thats straight up hypocricy . BCCI enjoys tax exempt status but operates like a commercial entity. Not only do they mooch of tax payers by using the police and such for their tournaments, they pay no tax on their income from IPL etc. Itna tamasha Olympic medalist ke liye karte , log motivate ho jhate Olympic ker liye World Cup with 5-7 countries Bhai tu bhi to naacha tu bhi to chutia hi hai How many FIFA world cup variations do you know of ? Is there a 30 minute football game, a 60 minute and a 90 minute ? FIFA World Cup also happens only every 4 years. I am pretty sure others would be fed up too if there was just too many football versions going on. If India would have won 50 over cricket, yes. That is a big deal. Happens every 4 years. But T20 World Cup just ain't it. Trophy parades happen everywhere. It's a completely normal thing. Just watch Argentina's trophy parade after they won the FIFA World Cup in 2022. Cricket is the probably the only sport where we can have such kinds of celebrations. No it isn't Exactly. Not paying tax on their income equates to siphoning off taxpayers's money. 1. They pay for the police protection 2. The players have to pay taxes on the amounts received. 3. BCCI does pay taxes in form of GST etc when the tickets are sold, I think in 2021-22 which is the last financial report released they paid some ~1,100 in taxes. 4. BCCI is a sporting body which like all sports bodies is exempt from Income tax due to promotion of sports purposes - being exempt is different & Not paying taxes is different. I am trying to cover multiple points here. I agree parade was a good thing. But the version of world cup, and the exuberance of overpaying cricketers that's what my main concern is. Kiya tha for PT usha, and that gold medallist guy. See Indian body structure is not meant for high intensity sports, toh kuch bhi kar lo, ghanta kuch hone wala hai . Football ka grassroot level pe bahut kaam hua hai to promote in India, but has it yeilded results. It won't, because our body structure is different. 💯 Bhai hota to hai. Neeraj Chopra ko 6 crore mile sirf haryana gov. se. Brand deals, sponsorship alag. Winners do get celebrated in india. Tl: haryana gave 6cr to neeraj Chopra. I would love to see if there is an account of how much they pay for police protection. And other use of municipal facilities Keep it unpopular. 1. We celebrated winning the World Cup and not playing the World Cup so saying that it happens every 2nd year is not related to the opinion. What is the issue if we have different formats for the game? 2. Agree with the state announcing rewards but BCCI giving away 125 cr is irrelevant here. 3. Never heard football-dominated nations talk about why football is popular compared to other sports in their country. If people love cricket then what is the problem? You are talking about the victory parade and unnecessary fandom, well we have won the World Cup and it should be celebrated. I don't think it is being exaggerated. Yes, we need to promote other sports and events like the Olympics but saying this win is exaggerated is not justified. Bro I was really happy that day. I was overjoyed that we won. As a country. After all these years. We should celebrate. I just don't like so much being overspent on already super rich cricketers. You have to follow the stories of the cricketers to understand the importance of this victory. Rohit Virat dravid(especially) pant hardik bumrah all these guys could have a movie based on what happened in the past few years of their career. The 2023 final loss, the drought of icc trophy, being the absolute best team yet failing short in some critical games. And all of this culminated in this victory let us celebrate it If you dont understand why people are celebrating the win you dont understand sports and you most probably never will.Why hate on other people's enjoyment?This feeling that you are intellectually superior for not enjoying sports is stupid.Let people enjoy and get some happiness what's the point of life if you keep on focusing on the negatives of things They used to release accounts quite regularly before due to SC direction, now they don’t. Let people enjoy. Tujhe nhi karna to mat kar It is weird to have a World Cup for every format. That too a World Cup that repeats every two years lol. Should at least be 4 years. Cricket overdose is real. So there is no proof they pay for police protection? I am also happy that India won and of course victories should be celebrated, but I didn't think that the t20 world cup was such a huge deal. I always felt that the ODI wc was the real deal. Maybe most people are coping with this win after we lost on the 19th. PS. imagine what will happen if India wins the ODI wc lmao I have no concern on them enjoying sports. I have myself enjoyed the win thoroughly. I have a concern of my tax money being spent on the already rich cricketers. People should be allowed to celebrate. We are a cricket crazy nation and cricket is one of the few sports where we can have these extravagant celebrations. The era of Rohit, Virat, etc., is soon coming to an end so this victory was more special. However, I do agree that Maha gov giving already rich af cricketers 11 crores is unnecessary. I also think the roadshow celebrations could have been better regulated though. My thoughts exactly. But the problem is that until you become a winner, you're on your own. I might be ignorant about this but isn't BCCI incredibly rich anyways?Are they actually spending the tax payers money or the money they itself generate from merchandise ticket sales and the shit load of money they get from the ipl Hockey was our turf, we lost our glory there… Give them bread and circuses and they will never revolt This is very true, OP is wrong for calling out the celebration. But Cricket overdose is also true to an extent. And State Government(s) paying players after BCCI themselves paying 125 Cr is beyond me, when other sports don't get alot of funds. BCCI is the richest cricket board they don't have to rely on your tax, they generate lots of money. Or stand in solidarity with those Olympians when they were abused by paw paw ka dost Brij Bhushan This is very true, But Cricket overdose is also true to an extent. And State Government(s) paying players after BCCI themselves paying 125 Cr is beyond me, especially when other sports don't get alot of funds. They actually do pay. Anybody who was worked in events will tell you, the police has to charge for the security provided & they pay for it. Yes mate if people weren't celebrating the world cup win ,everything would change and every issue in india would be solved. Doesn’t Fifa happen once in 5yrs? You won’t hear about Football right now. Unfortunately, Cricket is the only sport where India can exercise its soft power. Though the influence seems small due to the small number of nations where the sport is considered popular, in reality think of the HUGE Indian diaspora across the world that watches this sport. So some over-hype may be necessary. BCCI does not operate like other events. And that is why all babus and co get free tickets and passes etc. I can guarantee you BCCI pays a pittance for the state resources they consume. Or in many cases none at all. Whatever has been done at grassroots level for football, its nowhere close to what needs to be done if you want to be successful in the sport. See the other Asian countries and the amount of investment they've done in football compared to us. And if body structure was an issue, the likes of South Korea, Japan shouldn't have been performing the way they are. Cricket overdose is true. Its like 3 matches every week nowadays & with ipl its 2 matches per day for 2 months. Lost interest in cricket long time back due to same reason. Nobody is saying not to celebrate, what OP is saying is that it's going overboard. Like an overdose of a drug for mindless fans whose lives will not improve in any way, but the players will get crores of rupees and their Insta gloating will start soon. Koi khush bhi na ho ab Lord Punnet- Nalle Chapri Berozgar Log I strongly agree with the first point. Literally every year we have some sort of world cup or an ICC event & this will continue till 2031 at least. This diminishes the prestige of an ICC tournament especially world cups. Cause even if you lose, one can always come back & challenge for another world title the next year instead of having to wait for 4 yrs. This is exactly what happened to India Popular opinion: Some people simply can't handle the happiness of others Celebrate all you want, just maintain law and order and don't spend taxpayers money. If at all taxpayers money should go to other less funded sports not cricket. Yeah and if they didn't celebrate their life would have turned upside down.You guys don't understand sports and it's fine,stop acting like snooby superior beings who are more \"smarter\" than the people celebrating. FIFA World Cup is a very different thing from T20 World Cup. It is not even the ODI World Cup. There seems to be a T20 World Cup every 2 years, and T20 is the lowest rung of cricket skillwise. It is a good achievement but does not warrant such over-the-top celebrations. Unfortunately, T20 cricket is the opium of Indian people, and given what is happening elsewhere, they cannot be blamed for using this drug. Ok bro. Have a nice day :) Fuck off bro let people enjoy BCCI does not hire anybody for anything. 1. If it’s a bilateral series, the state association which is hosting the match is responsible for all payments to all vendors including security etc, BCCI will not be the one making payments. 2. In IPL, the teams hire the police and pay for it. Again BCCI will not be the one making the payment. This is pretty much how any national governing body anywhere in the world operates. Let people post on Reddit. Tujhe nahi padhna toh mat padh. But BCCI should not be exempt from tax! It is a money-making giant that does not need any incentives, which rather should go towards other sports and educational activities (or some grassroots cricket clubs not under the ambit of BCCI, if one wants to spend on cricket only). The whole celebrations got extended cuz the team was stuck in a hurricane. Or else we wouldn't have had a week full of celebrations. There is FIFA World Cup which happens every 4 years like you said and also Euros/Copa every 4 years. ( so even in football, every two years they have a big and prestigious tournaments happening) Just like we have ODI/T20 every 2 years. Same thing happens on every sport 🤦 I dont understand why this world cup is every two years instead of 4. Its like sooner or later india is going to win it. Theres nothing to celebrate the way we’ve gone overboard Its the one topic that brings whole of india together. Feels good to see the entire country in celebration Bhai agle hafte se agar koi bridge na girey to uski khushi mana lena No matter what, a worldcup win is a win, every team who participates in a WC will give their full might to win it. In that respect, cricket has a major ICC tournament now every year or even more frequently: between ICC World Test Championship Final, ODI World Cup, T20 World Cup, and Champions Trophy. Same here...I enjoyed the victory immensely and celebrated that night. Next day it was business as usual. Sure, felicitate the players but this open top parade and endless celebrations for a WC which happens every 2 years is going overboard. Putting cricketers on such a pedestal, that no wonder why other sports are so marginalized. That's my biggest issue, it's good that we are rewarding people who won the world cup, but come on, if we spent a fraction of that money on sports like football, table tennis, badminton and others, we would have so much more success in other sports as well I feel the opposite about money... Bcci makes a ton of money and it is giving them pennies in comparison.. The world cup we lost to Australia in 2003,the players got around 7-8 crores each ... On losing! Here they are giving them the same, after winning, 20 years, later... Its just that they sneakily announced it as a lumpsum so it seems like a lot By normal common man standards 8-10 crores is a lot... But given what the bcci earns from the players, it's really less.. We also have Asia cup which is equivalent to Euros/Copa. So not a direct comparison. Also the EURO and Copa are not conducted by FIFA. All the formats are conducted by ICC though. BCCI spends money on cricket. The amount of facilities that now exists is phenomenal compared to 20 years back. That’s how much they’ve poured back into the sport. They’re only exempt from income tax, they pay GST & stuff. If you don't know 3 players from hockey and football then whose mistake it is? Central govt or state govt? The government will follow where there is a crowd and the crowd is certainly with Cricket and cricketers. For me cricket is another sport and I did follow other sports as well like all olympic sports and Hockey, football as well. If we change the govt stance will also change for sure. You can lead the horse to the water but... What has population got to do with anything? does more population mean more talent coming across? absolutely not. because this post is filled with football examples, i'll give one: croatia, finals in 2018 fifa wc and semi finals in 2022 wc, do they have a very high population? Neeraj Chopra received training in Europe even before winning his gold. So did mirabai chanu. You are supported but you have to show some potential Dude, are you mad? This is India. We are talking about Cricket! Kinda sad that you're getting downvoted everywhere on the post, even after you've clearly said it's an **\"Unpopular Opinion\"**. My take on this whole parade is - \"Woh dekho sone ki chidya\", and we aren't even focused on what's happening in the country. It's like that dialogue from the Tejaswini movie \"Cricket Dekho Cricket\" On top of that, the amount of money that our governments are giving to the players is insanely unnecessary. BCCI announced a prize money of ₹125,00,00,000 to the team. Maharashtra is under a debt of approximately 80,00,00,00,00,000 and they want to award 11,00,00,000 to the Indian Cricket Team. Cricket Dekho Cricket! Zeroes ginne me adha time chala ja raha hai, and we are simply showering money on the players like they're some lap dancers at a strip club. *WTF is that economy rate (4.17) of Bumrah in the IPL and what a superb innings by Virat Kohli, glad to Hardik Pandya turn his image around considerably.* Cricket Dekho Cricket!! The players deserve our respect, but not our tax money. Train accidents are getting more and more common, people are dying due to climate changes and destruction of forests and fragile ecosystems. *But, what a beautiful speech by Rohit Sharma, I think he definitely deserves the spot to be captain, and a lovely handover from the legend Dhoni to Kholi to Rohit.* Cricket Dekho Cricket!! Vigilante groups are getting more and more power, and a lot of minorities from North to South, East to West are getting beaten up or killed or whipped. Manipur is burning on one side. Woh dekho, sone ki chidya! Either way, we have our Desh ka Ladla ka wedding coming up, so the nation is geared towards covering that without missing a beat. We have so much to look forward to! WTC I can understand it’s a different format. But yeah champions trophy doesn’t make sense anymore since there is already an ODI format World Cup every 4 years. World Cup happened in 2022, EURO in 2024. Next World Cup is in 2026, next EURO in 2028. On the other hand, T20 World Cup happened in 2022, ODI World Cup in 2023, T20 WC in 2024, T20 WC in 2026, ODI WC in 2027. In football, one event every two years, in cricket, it's every year. How are these two similar? Sure you also have a great day.if you see anyone celebrating in the streets please educate them The T20 World Cup is a joke. In T20 cricket any decent team can defeat any other team on a good day. That's not true for Test cricket or even ODI. Even the T20 trophy is small and looks cheap. I would love to see how much money is spent on luxuries of random 'officials'. Plus if it's a charitable organization which doesn't pay taxes then tickets to watch games should be dirt cheap. Basis cost. Only jobless countries do it in such excess. India, Argentina - anywhere else ? Now Maharashtra Govt has announced some 11 crore reward to these players, do they need it? It’s gone overboard in a country where drains are not cleaned before monsoons in top cities like delhi and bombay . Fuck this shit The T20 isn't as big as the ODI one, but it's our first major win since 2011 and we did beat the best sides and go unbeaten to win it. So I'd say the players deserve the fanfare. I am talking about the value it holds. The FIFA World Cup or Euros hold a lot of worth, and hence they have and they do parades. In cricket we have ODI/T20 and they hold the utmost value and we do parade for the win. I want to see the same thing happen with other sports and with women’s cricket. But that’s wishful thinking I guess I agree That's fake news If you don’t like it then turn the tv off. This happened because the rhythm broke after 2016 t20 wc. There should be a T20 wc happened in 2018 but since there is already. 2019 ODI WC happening the very next year. They chose to schedule the next T20 in 2020. Unfortunately Covid happened. So 2018s T20 WC happened in 2021, 2020s T20 WC happened in 2022 and so on. Nobody tells op how much money footballers make in Europe. Dude, let them celebrate... It's okay that they do whatever the fuck they want, unless it interferes with your personal life.. And I hardly think they're giving Taxpayers money to the cricketers, as BCCI probably gets tons of money from sponsorship and TV deals anyways... It's sad though, when you can give 125 crores to cricketers who are already paid crores in salary, for winning the shitty version of Cricket which happens like every 2 years when your Nation sucks in almost every other sport. It happens every year in England when clubs win the Premier League (football), and in other European countries as well. Even bigger parades happen when European clubs win the UEFA Champions League. So I don't really know how is it related to jobless countries. I dont get how these western 4chan incel nazi takes about indian body structure being bad gets popularized here Its all about community and education, indians arent mythically predisposed to having bad genetics, its all a byproduct of cultural norms, be physically active, train hard with intensity and learn properly since childhood and we can achieve wonders Fuck out of here with dumbass bad body structure arguments, india doesnt support our athletes and it isnt a viable career choice for parents to support their children and put them in sports since a young age is the reason for all this mess Make sports a lucrative career where you can earn good and see the engineer/doctor banegi aulad hysteria from parents fade out over the years and youll see what indian body strucutre is capable of You should’ve watched the celebration in Denmark when Jonas Vingegaard won TdF last couple of years. It is a completely normal thing to do. People are passionate for sports, they celebrate it. It keeps the economy going. I don’t see anything wrong in it. People go bonkers when their nations / clubs win Football Championships. Bro, you cannot compare argentinas celebration with india. Argentina wins it after what 38 years i think, meanwhile india just won in 2007. The ODI celevration is 2011 would warant such a velebration given our last win before that was 28 years before on 1983. T20 world cups happen every year unlike fifa world cup theres less prestige I think it was because of not winning a trophy for like 11 years, In Champions Trophy 2013 there wasn't a big celebration, people didn't care about it because we won the world cup recently, if we keep winning these trophies, the only trophy to be celebrated would be the ODIWC. And it's BCCI's money they can do whatever they want with it, Ambani spends it on his son's wedding, bcci spends it for the sport (not all) You are delusional if you think we have a body structure similar to japanese or koreans, first of all they have a very different diet+ they live in very different climate, suitable for not taking a toll on their body if they continuously ran for 15 kms. You haven't ever watched team sport, have you? Maybe, but what maharashta govt giving away money. Thats surely their taxpayers money. >You won’t hear about Football right now. You do know that both Euros and Copa America is going on, right? Football operates way too different than cricket. Yeah state government paying players doesn't make sense to me. And BCCI is a private entity, they are not responsible for development of other sports. Better ask fans of other sports to go and watch their fav team/club/player in stadium. This will help that sports to grow. Let people comment, tujhe pasand ni aaya to ignore kar Exactly. That's why we should really celebrate for India being the most consistent team in ODIs and Tests for the last 10 years. In the final any team can beat any other team on a good day like WTC final or ODU final and it's cheap. But the consistency Indian team has shown in test cricket and ODIs is class. Glad to see another true cricket fan who can look ahead of cheap trophies and can appreciate the team for good consistent, dominating cricket. Well said The magnitude of celebration is unwarranted. The t20 world cup trophy is significantly less prestigious than the odi one. For reference sake, there has been 9 t20 world cups in the last 18 years. That's more than double compared to the 50 over format. Even if we don't take that into consideration, let's say ODI WC happens in a year, next year will be T20 WC. Then two years later T20 WC again, and the next year ODI WC. This makes it 3 WCs in 4 years. Still more than football (1 major tournament in 2 years). Also, I haven't even taken the Champions Trophy into consideration. Arre! But you are the one who is putting up an opinion hating on people for celebrating and being happy for something. Football is also a joke then Any team can defeat any team Saudi Arabia beat Argentina in WC, right? Then only true sport is Test cricket, hardly any upsets. >Modi went and facilitated the players No, the players went to Modi if I'm not mistaken 🤔 The thing is we won a t20wc after 17 years. This is the major reason for this massive celebration. T20s are very competitive compare to odis and test. Exactly. Let others celebrate. I stopped celebrating a few days back but I am not a loser like OP to whine about others celebrating lol. How pathetic is OP's life Well said, Modi prioritising visitng these players show where his priority is. The large crowd indicated the unemplyment, State govt showering them with taxpayers money show they have no concern I agree prestige is very less compared to fifa world cup Exactly. Let others celebrate. I stopped celebrating a few days back but I am not a loser like OP to whine about others celebrating lol. How pathetic is OP's life You don’t sound like a fun person to be around. Happiness of others making you sad? Do *you* watch any of the other sports (including the women teams)? Are they still celebrating? Wtf guys. Two things that won’t complete in this country - jr ambani wedding and this. MCC has recommended to remove odi bilateral and champions trophy i guess. So we might see odis only in wc No one care about asia cup in cricket. Barely 5 country plays cricket properly. It's like joker vs joker clown competition Reg #3, tbf it's the people buying the tickets paying for the GST which is then simply handed over to the government. They're not paying it out of their own pockets. Euro cup is going on rn. Then ask those fans who like Olympic sports to show some loves for the medalist. No one knows neeraj chopra before he won gold in Olympic. This happens in cricket too. People started following cricket passionately after 1983 world cup win Tbf it’s due to the circumstances, we’ll probably not celebrate like this ever again for any icc trophy (except odi) unless we happen to go on a drought once again You are right: It IS an unpopular opinion. It doesn't matter how often a Cricket tournament happens. We _won_ the T20 World Cup after 17 years, a World Cup after 11 years and an ICC trophy after a decade. If there was ever a time to celebrate wildly, it's now. Now if they celebrate in the same fashion if we win Champions Trophy 2025 or the T20 WC 2026, then yes I would call it a bit excessive. In fact, I sincerely hope that whenever our women's side wins a World Cup we celebrate in the same fashion and give them the same love, admiration and cheers as we have just done for the men's team Indian football team lost to afg in a full 35k capacity stadium in guwahati. Many afg players didn't even have a club. Decade old indian football fans have just lost hope and maintained distance from Indian football for the time being BCCI does not take a single rupee out of your tax. So no tax payer loss. State govts give prize money to sportsperson. It is a norm. The Indian hickey team was given crores of money for beating just Pakistan 2 World Cups back. Neeraj Chopra has been handsomely rewarded. No need to single out cricketers in this matter. We will know names of all hockey players if theu win an Olympic Gold or a World Cup. Entire India got to know of Chopra, Sindhu, Saina and others when they won medals for the nation. We won this t20wc after 17 years! Yes it is a huge deal!! I dont get it it. Why are you salty about victory celebration. Money spent on honouring champions is all you see. Didnt you see how the roads of Mumbai. Everyone coming together to celebrate. Not an ounce of stupidity thats going on in this country in the name of religion. If thats the price we pay for such unity, then its well worth it. This is what you are looking for Chill dude. You need good moments to unite the nation positively. Sports does it wonderfully. Recently success of ISRO Missions has also united nation. Dont overthink as long as law and order is maintained and people are safe and sound in this celebration. It may be overdose for you, but to think of it \"the overdose\" is relative. We have overdose of \"Saas Bahu\" serials, but for some it is legit source of entertainment. IPL and ICC matches have indeed brought more revenue to govt in form of taxes, and added boost to hospitality and tourism sector. This is pure chutiyapa at peak It is also a cricket match afterall, being portrayed as if they won something non achievable. India needs to move on, no need to give that hype Samajho na yaar, apne hi paise phir indirectly unke haath me de rahe hein Tum moj mana rahe ho, unko ghanta farak nahi pad Raha, aur padega bhi There nothing much to celebrate about. This is all we have right now. Yea.. unpopular indeed This was nothing I still remember back in 2011 the whole night it was like Diwali. My dad took us on a car ride at midnight and it was wonderful. The craze back then was different than this time Women's cricket is growing at a rapid pace. WPL is a great success. Especially after RCB w winning the wpl. We are making world records in womens test matches. Shefali Vermaa and Jemimah are my some favorite women cricketers (DC bias) Those 125 cr are not tax payers money. Rhythm broke , so skip it ? Why make a mess out of it? We won t20wc after 17 years!! Its huggeee. What exactly is your point? There is no parade for IPL, even though it wont be unnecessary of there is.. Check spanish football for example, there is a ceremony(thoigh not this huge) for La liga winners.. that is there domestic league.. and world cup is a world cup.. every country celebrates it , even more so if its the most popular sport in your country. Check Argentina's win in last world cup. People love their players and their sport. You are just a bitter person BCCI isn't run by taxpayers money, they make shit ton of money themselves. Maharashtra part m I agree Even no tax policy for bcci feels very wierd It's truly one of the 2 things that connects all Indians irrespective of caste, religion, region and language. The celebration is justified. how will bcci, a private organisation, give taxpayers money? Ever heard of something called \" prestige\"?? Argentina hadn't wont the WC for 36 years ( last since 1986 and Maradona played). Messi, one of the GOAT's was playing his last WC. A lot was at stake, and the reward was that much sweeter. The whole competition was Prestigious. The same can be said for India 2011 WC. Waited for 28 years and Sachin was probably playing his last ODI WC. The 2011 ODI WC was prestigious, sentimental and had value to the Indians. T20 cricket simply put isn't prestigious enough to warrant a parade. But hey, people can do whatever the fuck they wanna do. Haan bhai ek tum hi ho jisko gidte bridge se dukh ho raha hai. Because cricket generates lot of income to government and people. So its not wrong to give money to them. Cricket generates a lot of income so its not wrong to gift them. Haan kyunki me tax deta hun. 20 saal ka unemployed ni betha reddit pe world cup jitna apni life achievement samajh k Ever watched Aussies celebrate the 1999 or 2015 wc win?? 2023 wc win wasn't hyped much by them cuz they had already won 2021wc + 2023 WTC so this one wasn't any special for them. 1. Cricket over dose - Don’t watch. There is no compulsion to anyone to watch cricket just because it is going on. If you are ranting about how you are spending your time, can assure you ranting wont help. 2. Taxpayers money - Bruh really? Do you know the kind of revenue BCCI generates? You cannot decide how they spend their money. About Maharashtra govt. MCA, one of the richest associations brings in tons of revenue and eventually tax to the MH govt. To put things in perspective, only the hospitality boxes at Wankhede went for 100Cr in 2023. All other sports people get a lot of perks and awards like sports quota jobs, cash prizes etc. They are not covered by news channels because the masses don’t care. 3. Modi didn’t go anywhere. Players went to his residence on invitation. Roadshow and Wankhede getting filled up - What is your problem with this? Nobody was forced to go. People went voluntarily to celebrate. Rest watched from homes. Don’t see anything wrong with this apart from the fact that a lot of other people were inconvenienced by this celebration but living in a metro comes with its pros and cons. If you do not know the names of 3 players of hockey and football. Whose fault is that in the day and age of smartphones and social media? You are consuming what is consumed by the masses, you are watching what is popular. If any other sport apart from cricket had brought the eye balls to it as much as cricket does. Those sports would have been promoted too. Since you’ve said you are getting an overdose of cricket, look up what is ISL and start watching it maybe? Everything in the end is going to trickle down to the attention that a sport can bring. Because advertising money. ye aagaye fir gaand marane I don't mind the celebrations. What i do not like is the lack of a trained physiotherapist nearby. What happens if Rishab pant gets a cramp while celebrating? >Tax Payer's Loss: BCCI is giving 125 Crores to these players. Maharashtra government giving 11 crores to already super rich players. Even though BCCI is a private entity, I am pretty sure somewhere or the other it is our honest taxpayers' money being siphoned through to these players. It's pure bullshit bro. Indian avg salary is 20k-25k. And the government is giving them literally 125 crores. They could have given each player 1 crore. They would have been enough. But NO! Cricket is most important thing in India. Mate there are bus parades for clubs winning their country's league or cup(which happens yearly). Even clubs that win multiple years in a row do it. But, the 11Crore offered by Maharashtra Govt. is tax payer money itself. Right? I don't even care about winning or losing It has turned into shitshow now Woh dekho sone ki chidya! 😂 What a useless mentality this guy has. I pretty sure who hate being indian. If others do it its great. But if india does it they are clowns. And who are you to decide when should people celebrate?? I am surprised that you are not seeing your superiority complex and aelf hating nature. Exactly, Fairly certain people over the world are far more interested in football rn. Yeah and doesn't makes sense tbh. Why should state government pay cricketers? >The T20 World Cup Celebration is going way overboard Rukna nahi chahiye Then let people call out your shit arguments. Ok bro stop crying No body is spending your tax money. Stop crying. BCCI makes money. Cricket makes huge amount for maha government. The money maha govt gave is nothing compared to what cricket adds to economy. So get down of your high horse. Everybody knows cricket adds huge amount to maha govt so this is nothing compared to that. Yes this is an unpopular opinion. Completely disagree.. Cricket is the only institution in this country which we are world beaters at and set the standards. It shows what we can get by focusing on performance and merit. So much to be proud of this team and group of players who have come from humble backgrounds and won the world cup. Let them celebrate, let the country celebrate this victory however they want. Someone fucking get a megaphone 📢 I can’t believe how overhyped it is. The sad part is, the amount we spend on cricket, the amount of fucks we give about the sport (compared to Australia, England, etc for whom it’s just 1 of many) and with the size of our population, it’s wayyy exaggerated. If anything we’ve been underperforming and this win should be more of a pat on the back saying “more of this please”. It's like a sports day in school, while no academic performance. Cricket truly is a joke Olympics is not as big as cricket in India, fans will celebrate what they like most. Why is this hard for you to get. I agree with cricket overdose. Every 2 years world cup doesn't feel like world cup lol. The verbal diarrhoea this guy typed is so laughable.So many butthurt clowns of this country and sub crying because people are celebrating and happy. According to this specimen 1)We shouldn’t watch cricket 2)We shouldn’t be happy 3)We shouldn’t celebrate 4)If we stopped watching cricket today people will revolt tomorrow In that case, T20 WCs are similar bracket to Copa/Euros. Trophies won are celebrated regardless. Also, Prestige builds with more trophies you win. Simple as that. You can read the comments and just see how much some people cry because others are celebrating and happy. These are some of the lowest forms of life. Don’t give fodder to right wing by being overly critical of a happy moment that most countrymen enjoyed Can only agree with your point 2. What you could've added is other sports getting same recognition and funding from govt and people. Cricket has become a religion thus the hate. We have Holi and Diwali every year, but does it ever really take away the excitement?Cricket has become a cultural obsession. Every culture has something similar that fosters unity, love, and a sense of belonging. The insane amount of money cricket generates for the economy cannot be understated. From uncles and 12-year-old children getting into the hobby and spending money on expensive bats to pizza delivery guys benefiting from increased business, cricket brings money, work, and greater opportunities. Secondly, we have no concrete evidence to support some claims. Although I 100% agree that the politicization of these players and the close ties of political entities with the BCCI, especially with Amit Shah's son being its chairman, definitely reeks of corruption. The players are unlikely to object to being billboards for politicians and Modi, but I doubt they could, given the government's tight control over the BCCI. I doubt a player could openly criticize Modi without facing professional consequences beyond the expected backlash from the public. We can claim that the amount of money from the government is excessive, and this is true. But there are different types of wealthy individuals, from oil barons and loan sharks to athletes and actors. Whatever your opinions of the rich, I would argue that sportsmen, especially cricketers, who are productive both economically and culturally, deserve their wealth. Maybe not government money, given the existing poverty, but they deserve to be rich more than many other professions. We should be cautious about this situation and discuss the excessive publicity blitz by politicians. I genuinely believe the collusion between the BCCI and political entities borders on outright corruption. These players are private individuals representing Team India, not politicians or the government. It's insane how the BJP and others intend to squeeze all the attention capital they can out of these players. In a country like America, you could openly question athletes for their support of certain politicians and their political advocacy and or support For example, look at how many times people like LeBron James have had to answer for their support to things. It's expected there, but not in India. Here, it would be considered very rude and unnecessary to ask such questions, although at some level it is justified, not every player has control over this, they might have to do a lot of things they don't want to, for the sake of their future But there is a genuine question to be asked regarding the benefits players receive from supporting certain things For example, people raked Ronaldo over the coals for his decision to take blood money from middle East with connections to a monarch. I would definitely ask some of the rich and established players what they think of the awful actions committed by the politicians they associate with and accept money from. However, I also doubt these players have the freedom to be individuals due to the corruption I mentioned earlier.. Regarding the hockey situation, it's genuinely sad. Hockey players deserve more money and effort from the government. However, cricket and hockey are very different sports. Cricket breached the cultural consciousness long before it became this huge. Perhaps one day I'll read enough about both sports to explain it, but I don't know why hockey hasn't gained the same traction despite movies and other efforts to promote it. Sometimes it feels like wrestling and kabaddi have overtaken hockey in cultural relevance. If we stop watching cricket all of the problems you quoted above will be solved? \"Cricket Dekho Cricket\" I don't think anyone forces you to watch cricket. I totally agree with the point of showering tax money on these players which is ridiculous. If this was the only point made, I would strongly agree but to drag national issues is a bit too much. It's not like cricket has been a substitute for addressing these issues. These can be addressed even when cricket is followed at its peak or can still be left unaddressed even when cricket is an alien term. The parade was for a day and you have the opinion that we are not even focussing on the real issues. Well, when we didn't have the world cup did we focus on the real issues? Why drag cricket into this? What do you mean, my fellow Bhartiyan? I'm happy! I'm actually singing Rahman's Vande Mataram and waving the Indian/Bharat Flag while watching the Parade. Don't you see jumping on my toes? This is the only physical game we can win the World Cup, please let us enjoy the same. Taxpayer hai aur india ko rape capital bhi bolta hai? Correctly said, a game that is very much limited to the Indian subcontinent and we are celebrating like we won the FIFA World Cup. There are at max 5-6 teams that can be said to play decent cricket, out of which India is a behemoth in the game. I think the cricket scene is too overdone, rest of the sports are not even looked at. Our FIFA rankings are constantly poor, a nation of 1.4 Bn is ranked poorly compared to most of the middle eastern countries. And look what is happening to that country! I condemn your lack of awareness as to how funds are generated. imo people have so many problems in life and cricket gives that joy which is otherwise missing in every day life. I am not a cricket fan, but looking at fans celebrations I wish I was one. I would rather watch ipl than someone throwing javelins One more ignorant prick. Well, to be quite fair, we are comparing apples to oranges here. We are talking about the distractions we are fed through the news cycle. The support that we have for our National Players is immense and laudable no doubt, but I think we've been going quite overboard lately. National issues have to be dragged when we are fed multiple distractions, I think several people on the sub are also worried how little memory we have about issues plaguing our country. And, the folks who are doing that are merely jogging our memory and showing us the reality instead of a golden deer or a golden bird in the sky. Try to understand the other POV as well. We still enjoy the game, but not at the risk of drowning ourselves in it! Peace! 🙏🏼 This is a picture of Real Valladolid fan's celebrating promotion from second division to first division. Remember this is not even a world cup or a trophy. These leagues take place literally every year and yet look at the level of celebration. We at least have a sporting culture in one sport. There's no need for anyone to think fans are going overboard. Other sports not getting attention has nothing to do with cricket fan culture. It is a completely separate systemic issue. Don't correlate both of them. The hype of the win is too much .. they are behaving like iska baad will win again after decades Why should BCCI be concerned about Football? I don't think your opinion is as unpopular as you think. There are many more who feel the same way but just keep quiet on the internet to avoid the kind of DMs you got. Of course we will celebrate. It’s not as if we won in a truly competitive sport like football. We won it in the most competitive sport of all- cricket. Do you know that FIFA is also a charitable organization? So does every taxpayer, I don't see them getting any tax cuts. How is this whataboutism relevant here. Why do you folks have a problem with literally everything? Are you not a fan of team sports? Don't watch it. I dislike the obsession with cricket India has, since I'm a football fan, but what you're doing is blaming people for celebrating a ICC trophy after 11 long years. The trophy parades, distribution of generous amounts of money to already rich atheletes etc, happen ALL the time. Footballing nations do it, football clubs do it, basketball teams, cricket teams do it, everyone does it. When Argentina does it - it's passion, but poor old Indians shouldn't be allowed to properly celebrate anything, huh? And the same people complain about the lack of sports culture. Hyprocrisy, inferiority complex, or both? >Plus if it's a charitable organization which doesn't pay taxes then tickets to watch games should be dirt cheap quoting you. I hope you understand. Bruh. How is fifa being whatever it is relevant to what I am saying. I'm saying BCCI tickets should be basis cost. What does fifa have to do with it. they just made up a false scenario and got mad at it. > I am pretty sure somewhere or the other it is our honest taxpayers' money being siphoned through to these players. fucking lol I just don't understand the new trend of terming everything \"distraction\". No one is trying to distract anyone from the real issues with the help of cricket. It is something that people have loved and enjoyed over the years. Relating to your mention of the overdose of cricket. I got bored of cricket after back to back watching the 2011 WC and IPL. It was only this year that I started watching cricket because of my office colleagues who love cricket. And with the way India played I am happy that I did. are we really getting mad at people celebrating sports now? and then we bitch about how we don't have passionate crowds like european football crowds. people here *really, really* don't like anything good happening in India Billionaires generate a lot of income as well, for the economy as a whole on top of that. Now should they also be \"gifted\" with a tax rebate? Not unpopular at all. It is completely over the top, unnecessary and silly given that it is firstly, a game played by max 4 serious nations for which we pride ourselves like we've scored some massive achievement. Within the game it's also the fast food version that we're champions in. All this is just show-sha for Jay Shah, nothing else. > T20 is the lowest rung of cricket skillwise That's not true, elitist purists are the bane of any sport, please don't be that guy > Unfortunately, T20 cricket is the opium of Indian people, Again, myopic take. T20 is the most popular form of cricket today & it is also the fastest growing format of cricket in traditionally non-cricketing nations. If it's very popular elsewhere, why would it not be in India? It's not just limited to Indians, broaden your perspectives. BCCI has funds to give away to players, let them. Agree on the 11 Cr given by Maharashtra state which could've been invested elsewhere. L takes on the celebrations though. All countries celebrate FIFA World Cups/Euros/copa America (which happens so frequently) in the same way. Forget that, even football League winners celebrate with a grand parade even though it happens every year. Let fans enjoy their sport and celebrate. No need to gatekeep it I'm sorry, what happened this time that was different from 1983, 2007, and 2011? I see the exact script that is being followed. Did anything different happen this time? >I'm saying BCCI tickets should be basis cost. because they are a charitable organization? It is also a private entity which is free to do whatever it wants. BCCI does pay tax. 1.

I get the point of PR Teams, 11 Players + BCCI leads to atleast 12 different PR Teams which is a whole lot of information being stuffed into us, and that's their primary job. Next we'll be subjected to Pandya's personal life, Kohli's retirement from T20 and a bunch of other things. Then we have the wedding coming up, with dignitaries, celebrities, models, all over the world coming over and that'll take up more of our bandwidth. We need to get back to actual news asap. And, that's what most of the people here are talking about. While celebrating is great, balance is key. Too much focus on one victory can overshadow other sports and misuse resources. Let’s enjoy responsibly! They generate far more money for govt than they get received from govt. So govt awarding them is not wasting tax payers money. I think you are not understanding the simple logic. Sports persons are always awarded by govt even if they dont generate any revenue for the govt. So warding cricketers for this is nothing wrong. They are given tax cuts and incentives to do business by the govt. This is just a T20 WC not even 50 over WC. You have to have some really low IQ to be defending a charitable organization charging through the roof when the same thing can be provided basis cost. Best of luck with life.god knows you need it >You have to have some really low IQ why the obsession with IQ? BCCI does do charitable work. They help budding cricketers and sponsor them. This is their charitable work. Tell me, if I have a company and have absolute monopoly in my field, will I charge less or more? The other thing is that other than India/Pak and a couple of other countries, most people don't know/don't care about cricket. I'd even say most people didn't even know this T20 WC was going on, let alone knew that India won. It's not like it's a global competition along the lines of the FIFA World Cup or something. It's like winning a tournament that only a handful of countries participate in and many of those participating nations have very little to no local cricket interest. So celebration should be put into perspective. If India can win something major like a FIFA WC or a WRC Rugby WC it could warrant a grander celebration though. Bilkul sahi BAAT > How many FIFA world cup variations do you know of ? Is there a 30 minute football game, a 60 minute and a 90 minute ? Yes.

ODI, T20 or test, there are people interested in all formats. With all due respect, you went on a different tangent altogether. And I don't know who the \"Most of the People\" you are referring to because I don't see anyone else putting this matter the way you have. You are clearly talking about the news aspect and the media coverage rather. If you really care about the news you can switch to newspapers. There is adequate coverage there. Media will cover what is loved by people because, at the end of the day, they are also commercial entities. Whatever is a greater news will always be featured be it cricket or something else. My only concern was that there is no correlation between cricket and national issues. Enjoying a victory is not at the cost of the nation rather it is something that unites us all. What a stupid argument to make: Champions League happens every year and people celebrate the shit out of it. The BCCI collects the GST on behalf of the government like every other organization. We are celebrating like the way we are because 95% of the country is Gawaar! Well NO. Celebration were justified. Atleast people are taking interest and time for cricket Don’t even compare with the FIFA World Cup lmao. Sadly I see them being downvoted into oblivion! \"Woh dekho Sone ki Chidya\" has been my point since the beginning. And that is an actual correlation. The rest of what you said about people being commercial entities and news channels cover what generates money/TRP is absolutely on point. And the more people/entities focus on real issues, the more we can steer the media back into the right track. Ye DM wala kaun banda hai. Bohot hero ban rha hai. Real life mein inka mooh nhi khulta aur screen ke piche chupke bohot gali dete hain No, not \"All\" indians. I feel happy when it happens, but not to the extent of going around the city at 2am to celebrate. Its sports at the end which is an ancient form of entertainment. The question should be: Do you watch women sports? I bet you don't even watch sports at all. Agree with you OP Not to comment on prize money given by BCCI. It's the boards money. But i dont think it makes much sense for state governments to give players more cash on top of that. Feels like pouring water in an already filled pot. It is for every sport federation, people are being very reactionary but it is not just that they have to pay 15-20 players, there are 38 ranji teams in India, cricket season is almost 8-10 months. Bcci supports them too, ( they hardly receive eyeballs to be self sustainable), there are n number of other domestic leagues, and all the player are paid handsomely, so even if someone doesn't play nationals they still can live comfortably. And bcci do donate to other sports federation. Yes. Had a brainfart. Totally agree with you. Great job, India, but this is a sport competitively played by only a handful of countries. Now, succeed in a sport that bears more prestige on a global scale! You said all that but how bcci is paying 125cr to players?, isn't that ignoring all those domestic leagues and matches FINALLY A COMMENT THAT I TRULY RESONATE WITH. People are saying 'India is a behemoth in cricket out of 5 or 6 nations that play seriously' as if that's a bad thing. It's like saying the US should stop playing American Football or Ice Hockey or Baseball because they're one of 2 or just the only nation that plays those sports seriously. And don't tell me they don't hype up Baseball or the NFL (American Football league). The Super Bowl (NFL final) is literally the biggest sporting event in North America. Millions watch it, from Mexico to Canada. We should be proud of our own beautiful game and continue to strive for excellence in it. People are saying 'India is a behemoth in cricket out of 5 or 6 nations that play seriously' as if that's a bad thing.

If you don't know about something perhaps the best course of action is to be silent rather than spewing nonsense. They pay in lakhs (1-5 lakhs)for each match in this league to each player, then there are manager coaches and what not. I'm not talking about the prestige of a club or Country.. I'm talking about the prestige of the competition / trophy. When you say FIFA WC, you see the the 94 years of history, It's importance, remember great players like Pele, Maradona, Zidane, Cruyff. There's value to winning that trophy When you say ICC ODI Cricket WC, you see 49 years of history and great players like Tendulkar, Kapil dev, Viv Richards etc. There's value for winning that trophy Sure, T20 would be considered prestigious , somewhere 15-20 years down the line when it has gained some history. Right now it's just a worse format of cricket played 2 yearly and has as much relevance as the UEFA nations league. The fact that you compared T20 to Copa and Euro's makes me laugh. GST is paid by the viewers buying tickets. BCCI merely transmits it to the government. But it’s wrong to say BCCI pays taxes. It pays no direct tax on income and it transmits indirect tax. To sach na bolun bhai? Har chauthey din news me hota kuch aur perpetuators hmare yaha aram se ghumte elections me ladte I think there is a Champions Trophy scheduled for 2025. ICC doesn't always act on MCC recommendations, especially in these times when it just wants to make as much money as possible, sometimes even wanting to kill the hen with the golden egg. You forgot Champions Trophy which is going to take place in 2025. Every year there is something. You have also forgotten the WTC finals. A sport in which USA can beat Pakistan, you call that as competitive? Yes, if you are saying that anyone can beat anyone. In that sense, of course, very competitive. But T20 is a format in which the difference between low and high quality becomes less, even ordinary players can do very well. That is not some purist opinion: that is a fact. You have the same resources but playing for a significantly shorter time: temperament and skills cannot be tested fully. If it is the opium of the people, of course it is the most popular form of cricket in India! In countries like England and Australia, Tests continue to be the most popular form of cricket. But whatever be the format of cricket that is popular, cricket serves as an opium in those countries where people otherwise have little to cheer in the world of sport and also have other problems in their lives. Hence, the craze in all of Indian subcontinent: the craze in Nepal and Bangladesh is even more than in India! There is nothing purist about the fact that in T20 you can achieve big things even with ordinary skills. Ah shit. I am the wrong one here. I thought I was replying to that woman. I deliberately didn't mention those 2 events because they weren't even needed. But thanks for bringing them out. should have worded my comment better. I meant that the amount of attention and funding that cricket receives is a little too much, and more of those funds should be directed to other sports For something that happens every year, it cannot be the same value as something that happens every 4 years. In cricket, a global tournament is happening every year, whereas in football a global tournament happens every four years. Of course, and yet BCCI loves them, because a lot of people do watch the India-Pakistan match in it. I definitely understand the sentiment. Just saying even if the government didn't award them it wouldn't make much difference. But there are other places where this money will definitely make a difference. Awards cricketers is about optics not practicality. Public money should be spent where it makes a difference most but sadly optics becomes more important. They wanted to milk money, this is why we have reserve day only for ind pak match in aisa cup No ones asking US to stop playing but if they played baseball and won against 5 other countries who hardly take the sport as seriously as the US, they will never do such an over the top celebration. T20 World Cup is played every 2 years for fucks sake the way we’re celebrating it’s like we won 5 in a row. How many teams compete for the champions league and how difficult is to get qualified for it? Both those countries on average have a similar build in terms of height and body mass as us. Infact, we have more diversity due to a more diverse gene pool (north, north east, south etc). Diet is something which can be controlled and managed for players from a young age, if the proper amount of focus is given to other sports, similar to cricket. If you were to go by bodytype, Neeraj Chopra won Olympic gold in a sport we were nowhere in the running forbeating out heavyweights from Europe and the US. Why? Because he got proper coaching, funding and the right environment to succeed in. This mindset of its not possible from people like you, is the reason why we don't have success in the international arena There is one fifa world cup that happens every 4 years, more than 175 countries play qualification before 30 odd teams got selected for the 2022 world cup. The craze and the adminstration of football is spread across all the continents. Cricket on the other hand is just an Indian sport administratively and financially. The whole tournament from scheduling to venue selection is made as per the wishes of Indian team. India was the only team to know which venue they would play the semis at, even before the tournament started. Such biased administration isn't there in football. Plus think of it since 2019 i.e last 5 years there have been 2 odi WCs, 3 t20 WCs and 2 test world cup, so overall 7 WCs in 5 years. So NO, Argentina winning the WC is not the same as India winning a T20 WC."
