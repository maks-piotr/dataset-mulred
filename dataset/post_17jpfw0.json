    "selftext": "I found this ad on fb marketplace selling iPhone 13 under warranty for cheap. They asked me to contact on this number, when I called no one picked and then I received a WhatsApp msg asking for the model I need. They asked for booking amount and only COD option I suspected it's a scam and didn't reply. \n\nToday I received another message from this number with I an offer for 18k for iPhone 14 and airpods both. I replied I'll pay 25k by net banking but not the booking amount and they denied and I messaged 'pele jaoge'. Immediately I received a voice message of a female threatening to complaint to police. And within a few seconds I received video call which I didn't attend and then I got a call on phone number this lady started threatening and saying you don't know who I am jo karna hai karle tere par case dalti hu main. I couldn't record the call and blocked the number immediately.\n\nDo these people get protection from police to run their scam business how can they openly threaten without a sign of fear. I'm worried what if they sell my number to other scammers or report it on Truecaller this is my only number associated everywhere I can't change it.",
