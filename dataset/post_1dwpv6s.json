If the law was the same for both men and women, I don't think it would be so outrageous or unfair.

Even after divorce, a man has to give some form of settlement to the woman even if she was the one who cheated or destroyed the marriage.\n\nIn such cases, another law like this which can be used by gangs to threaten the male population easily is extremely dangerous. Companies already fire or refuse to give jobs to people with ongoing cases against them.

And court views the kid as not guilty party if in order to punish the women they refuse child support the kid would lose financial stability that would be detrimental to their academics and survival. \n\nWe need better laws to be honest. Especially around marriages. We cant apply 1950s laws to current marriages as the way of thinking has changed. We need to have paternity tests at the time of birth and if the offspring is from an affair the affair partner will be held liable for the child even if the couple make up.

Why must he be punished‚Ä¶ plus if you were active on true off my chest sub you will see that a lot of fathers love the kid even though the kid might be through an affair.

Me and my friends (both girls and boys) also talked a lot to her so that she never felt alone or afraid. I understand where you're coming from in this regard, but to me my friend matters a lot more than a random creep.

If you think women are angels all the time, take a good Hard look at yourself. Are there not female killers? Are their not women who kill their husband's for their affair partners? I've seen women who killed their own child too. I've seen women who've massacred their own family including their own parents for their lover. Assholes exist across genders. Unfortunately in our country, that number is skewed heavily towards men. That I do agree with. I read about female serial killers and most women in that comments section were sympathetic to her. Heck, they were even sympathetic to Dahmer and Bundy. I guess because most of their victims were men.\n\nThat should not mean however that you will label all men as misogynistic who disagree with your opinion.

If you're talking to women genuinely, you would have noticed this as well. The level of force associated with marriage in a country where marital rape is not a crime, contested divorce is a thing and no fault divorces don't happen is extreme. \n\nObviously women criminals exist, as you pointed out - they're far far far less in number compared to men (in india atleast). There are bad people everywhere..but here's the thing - majority of women criminals are not rooted in sexism or gender bias. Men still harm women a lot more. Gang rapes, acid attacks, stalking and harassment - never taking no for an answer is far more common. There's a reason men aren't as scared as women to walk down an empty road after dark in india. \n\nThere's idiots who hero worship criminals everywhere as well.

Imagine gatekeeping them.\n\nI never said this country needs severe reform in laws for women and the way that they are executed.

A lot of cases it's subtle but very regressive manipulation and thinking. AM is one of the biggest societal evil - a casteist and misogynistic practice that noone seems to oppose properly - not even women. It's honestly astounding and shocking how many women defend the practice and often join in shaming women who choose to not marry or are childfree. \n\nIt's not about 25+ it's everywhere. √Ät my office, during night shift timings, women aren't allowed to leave on their own. It's mandatory to take office cab - or have a registered family member/husband pick you up. And, this ends up excluding allowing bfs to pick up or women able to go alone (unless they have own vehicle). Yes it's good womens safety is taken seriously but honestly, the necessity of this is nuts. Esp cause office cab cuts from our salary, opting out and taking auto instead would save us money and cost about 2k less, which means men get to save 24k a year just cause they're men. \n\nCampus security doesn't help much when women want to step off campus. During my college days, at campus hostel, women literally had a 6pm deadline (and classes end at 5) so except weekends they can't do jackshit. Boys hostel had NO deadlines. Even living off campus, I had a 9pm deadline unless a family member came and picked me up and informed the hostel. \n\nThere was an uproar a few years ago too, when the govt tried to show women empowerment by making bangles and sindoor tax free, while sanitary products are expensive af. What's worse is that capitalist exploitation has not just increased price of these products, but reduced the size and quality, which led to mishaps and miscalculation (including me) and wasting money and trips to gynaecs and stress thinking our flow was affected or increased and worrying about our health. When all the time it was capitalist exploitation. And there's NO regulations in place. \n\nI always thought women would disappear once they got married and they don't care for friends anymore. I always felt that when I was a teen and younger. But afterwards I came to realise it's only women who went into AM that vanished. Women who married their bfs, may have reduced contact a bit and not as free (esp after having kids) but they still make time, come to meet and hang out and spend time and call. It's ones who entered AM that seem to vanish completely. \n\nI am all for gender equal laws in general. But with how the society and crime is skewed in india, I can never stand for gender neutral laws here until the society is more egalitarian. \n\nI understand your anger. But I was trying to make a point that men literally hate women so much in india, that they wasted their energy opposing laws that protect women instead of fighting for laws that literally protect men and trans men.",

But a guy(our classmate in primary school) wanted to marry her and did a similar thing as you mentioned.   \nHe went from house to house in their community and distributed a 'love-jehad' type letter. I never got contacted by anyone since I lived in a different city but many people 'visited' her parents and some visited my parents. She and her family stayed strong and did not give in to the social pressure so this dude could not involve law enforcement, fortunately, but this all lasted for a year and she and her family were harassed many times.   \nEven when we went to a temple(temple in my small town where many people get married) to arrange my marriage, they said go get married and registered on legal papers first so that there wouldn't be any ruckus made by 'some people' from her side.",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Some people might claim that it is only applicable in case the man promised marriage but the law does not provide any sort of evidence critea for the same. So if a man says \"we should live together forever\" it can be claimed as a promise of marriage under this law. Previous laws were already under scrutiny for the unfair treatment of men in the country, but this law can simply land you in jail on a She-said He-said basis, giving unprecedented power of blackmailing a new recipe for disaster in the wrong hands. Please stay safe. Jai Hind. üôèüèº Source(s): 1) 2) 3)",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "The hell... This can't be correct. R*pists are running around free claiming they did not r*pe and this is probably their way of \"saving\" women. Like a r*pist gives a shit. Maybe Governments should come out with their real agenda and compel *Male foeticide* Every law and responsibility is only to be obeyed by men. Criminals are protected while genuine men trying to get away from abusive relationships will be punished... Half of men will probably prefer being single Mummy wake up, new excuse for bahu absence just dropped /s E ka chutiyegiri ha Babua. There are a few things I wish were true. One of them is fair treatment to all. But the only \"fair\" politicians know is from bootlicking fair and L#v#Ly from capitalist's footwears What if, suppose, a man is married but has deserted his wife for years? Is it covered under the law This is a bad law, but ye zyada ho raha hai Hey Babe come and have a look, new population control law just dropped. Can somebody explain why this is bad? Unless the court is simply going to believe what woman says instead of giving proof I don't see an issue. Back in school most guys used to lie girls about marriage so that they would be open to the idea of exploitation. This law is good unless it's going to straight up believe word of mouth instead of written proof. It is a ground for divorce. Jitna mujhe pta hai . That's it. I am gay from now on. Shaata. Because it can be misused I suppose ? Vaise yeh IPC me bhi tha Because you can be arrested under this law as long as a woman says \"He promised to marry me\" without the need to provide any sort of proof at the time of registration of FIR. Once done, the guy will be arrested and presented before a court. And knowing our courts, it will take years for the guy to prove his innocence, because the woman can claim he said so and so during this time period and the guy will have to prove he did not (at least this is what I could understand by looking at similar such cases in the past) I think the most important person that a man in India now needs is a good lawyer, lol Wait until someone files a case against the lawyer under the same section. Inception at home ho jayega Don't women needs proofs ..? I mean they are not going to arrest anyone without soild proofs Section 69 That‚Äôs why I tell everyone to be gay. Not for me personally but for their own protection. Just saying LamooüíÄ This isn't new right. And as I said if the law is strict about written proof then the law is good. This hopefully put a stop to isots who start talking about marriage in few weeks of dating just to get women to be open to sex. People who are against it are probably getting a reality check that what they did was wrong and they can now end up in jail. Kya pta Bhai üòÖ. Implementation pe depend krta hai My brother in Christ, criminal law requires something called proof beyond reasonable doubt to convict someone. This is no way a ‚Äúhe said she said‚Äù sort of a situation. This is a beneficial legislation made to encompass situations that were not there before. Section 69 üòè It might but trust me the amount of boys and men I know, who use the promise of marriage for sex and money is just ... hopeless!! And there excuses: 1. Vo iske bina degi hi nahi 2. Ladkiyon ko aise hi treat karte hain. 3. Yar vo serious relationship hi chahti hai. To serious to act karna hoga na. 4.... ... This is a new law right? Like thee old one was canceled and new one was made. So somebody go through what the law actually states and then complain. Like I said, if it simply believes whatever a woman says then it's wrong obviously but if law can only be applied when there is written proof then it's good. This will only control the population of the middle class. A Law to fuck over people's lives is numbered 69. Not Nice. Definitely conviction won't be on a he said she said basis, I was only parroting what the various sources said on this, and the other lawyers comments But the situation still remains that a man can be arrested under this law right? And the arrest warrant will be based on the FIR filed by the woman, after which the court processes will start which might take years. At least this is what I could understand. Do tell me if I am wrong here. So no trouble if they fulfill the promise? Prostitution legalize karne ka tareeka thoda cazual he New India These laws even when the IPC was there only favoured women. Now it's even worse and no one is talking about reforming it. This is actually true Stay away from Indian woman don't even try to interact if you don't want to go to jail.. 69 nice only men are punished not women Oh yes absolutely. Cannot ignore these scummy men either. But at these instances I'd say the partner in the relationship should also take some responsibilities and only go for sexual relationships after marriage if they want to establish marriage for sexual intimacy. And this should go both ways and not just one. If the law was the same for both men and women, I don't think it would be so outrageous or unfair. But when only one demographic in a country is targeted without any reciprocation to the complainant, then that will only lead to a lot of false cases including those which blackmail innocent men into giving money. Wasn't this the exact same thing in IPC as well? I don't think BNS was a necessary thing but laws have always been like this. but now the men will no longer date for marriage and now casual relations will be the new norm True, just like every other section in that Act, this section can also be misused by a vindictive person. But this narrative that men are in danger because of a beneficial legislation catering towards women is a bit too much of unnecessary fear mongering. It says false promise of employment or promotion. Say, is it legally allowed to have physical relationship in lieu of employment or promotion? And suppose you had sex with a female and employed her, how long would you've to keep her in the firm so that you're off the hook of BNS. And regarding the false promise of marriage part, i bet one can act and become so wired that you'll be running after the woman to marry and she'll refuse. Many of these laws are meant to protect to women in rural areas of India. But in metro cities, these become too powerful a weapon in hands of women and some are bound to misuse it. You know, i feel worried about the future generations. Indian men should stop marrying at this point.. the judiciary is fucking shit You are missing the point. The law can be applied even for casual relationships. And that's what is scary. It might mean blackmailing men once the casual relationships are over with the threat of this law. Btw marrying me is illegal and would be considered as a violation of Geneva convention and failure to meet basic human rights Had seen a Gumraah episode on the same a decade ago. The guy ended up having a horrible fate :(( Every law in the Indian Civil Code is manipulated to harass innocent people, whereas felons and criminals are garlanded and felicitated. Now I am not saying every Indian is like this but , justice is seldom served to ordinary citizens. And with the way laws are weaponized against Dalits,minorities this new law will be further wielded against the people. God save India Not if you are non-biological, law of the land doesn‚Äôt apply Doesn‚Äôt this law apply to same sex couples? It doesn‚Äôt say so right? Befitting a country and befitting law for the cattle class who thinks about nothing politically... It‚Äôs simply weaponization of law to arrest anyone that the mobs protected by politico-religious fanatics will target. Mark my words. Especially UP, MP, Chattisgarh, all the saffron states. I think this fear mongering is a bit necessary. Because laws like these are used by people who want to blackmail others into giving them benefits, mainly money. In India, prenup is illegal. DNA based testing for children conceived outside of wedlock is illegal. Even after divorce, a man has to give some form of settlement to the woman even if she was the one who cheated or destroyed the marriage. In such cases, another law like this which can be used by gangs to threaten the male population easily is extremely dangerous. Companies already fire or refuse to give jobs to people with ongoing cases against them. And cases such as these take years to close and acquit an innocent man. So anyone, even the non-gullible, will have to bow down to the pressure of this law so that his life is not ruined by a stranger. Law with good intentions. One of my classmates was dumped after being \"used\" about 14 years ago. There will be grey areas if the deed was done only once or twice and the man dips he will be held accountable. If there was an actual relationship for more than 1 year this law might not be in play. Basically don‚Äôt explore/date? Idk why anyone is surprised. This law existed even before the revision of IPC. People are dragging it forward now to show that the present government is shit. Not that it isn't, but this is hardly new. I read it in Gangajal/Vasuli bhai voice. Pretty much. Seems like an agenda to push \"traditional arranged marriages\" the senile old demented politicians of our country. It specifies heterosexual terms‚Ä¶so i guess no What about non-binaries(or something like that) these days? Not nice at all though. BNS was supposed to be a better law book and an upgrade from IPC. At least IPC (afaik) had clauses to prevent certain misuse of the law but BNS has a total absence of any leeway for a man to break up with the woman. Like say a man promised to marry a woman. Later on in the relationship the woman claims to absolutely not provide any financial help in the relationship after marriage and this makes the man break up with her. He can still be placed under this law and tried as a criminal, facing ten years in prison. What if you promise to marry her and later some problems occur due to which they break up or she breaks up? I'm sorry I didn't see any such sections and exceptions as such under the law. Where did you get this from? \"i'm not looking for marriage\" \\~ men over text before meeting should be enough this will hurt the women more because now they can't find commitment anymore because even nice men will be hiding because of this and slowly the default setting will change where the women has to convince the man for marriage Rape of men by men rape is no longer an offence. Good luck! Yep no relief/exception under the law I could find. Apart from false accusations, an actual, laid-out legal disaster Indian men should think about: The BNS offers no protection to men and transgender persons against rape. The IPC had a provision for this, which experts advised to retain in the BNS, but they were ignored. Men should be up in arms about this, but they don't seem to care? There's no ruckus. It's crazy. They want all of us to be GAY No i didn‚Äôt mean it as a section. I am saying there will be grey areas where the judge will look at before giving the verdict. This law is not very black and white. Lets say the girl cheats on him will the judge still sentence him to prison for not marrying her? Plus its also the accusers duty to prove that the man intended to have sexual intercourse with her through deceitful means. If she cant prove that the courtship of the man will deceive a sane person with adequate mental capacity the man might not be sent to jail. Do they want all of us to be GAY?? >The law can be applied even for casual relationships. how is it proved whether the relationship was casual or serious? what's the way to label it? Why the fuck is this shitty proposed law not being struck down? [REPEAL SECTION 69 OF BHARATIYA NYAYA SANHITA 2023](https://www.change.org/p/repeal-section-69-of-bharatiya-nyaya-sanhita-2023) Get in touch with your local politicians and powerful contacts, and get the law taken down ASAP! >Lets say the girl cheats on him will the judge still sentence him to prison for not marrying her? Yes. Judges offer alimony, settlement and child support even if the child is not the husband's. Heck DNA testing of a child is illegal in India during divorce proceedings. You think they will care now? poor( most indians) and rich ( who r above law) will still reproduce . Only the middle-class will suffer . Under this law, no way to prove it. The woman can claim she only consented for SI after man said he will marry her and the man can be arrested and presented before a criminal court Sadly it is true. It was already a draconian law and instead of modifying according to times,they made it harsh Yes, it is another one of India's shitty, misandric and gynocentric laws. ***[Whoever has sexual intercourse with his own wife, who is living separately, whether under a decree of separation or otherwise, without her consent, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than two years but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.](https://devgan.in/ipc/section/376/#:~:text=Whoever%20has%20sexual%20intercourse%20with,shall%20also%20be%20liable%20to)*** How tf is this possible what do you mean? This law was probably brought in to entice Bajrang dal members. They work their arse off on valentine's day to find couples. üòÇ They definitely needed a law to reduce relationships. stay single or get married are the only two choices with this law . No relationships . But with the bias gender laws in divorce . Even marriage is not an option until you completely trust the girl . Which again this law won't allow . SO its a loop . lmao what the fuck is this puritanical bullshitüòÇ What if u marry this person if they try to use this law. Is getting a divorce illegal? Seems like a joke, but might be legal, idk that‚Äôs not how consent works lol Tbh we often feel very angry about cases where the child is not the father‚Äôs but he still has to pay child support. I myself was angry at a lot of those. But the kid is not at fault, it was the fault of the mother. And court views the kid as not guilty party if in order to punish the women they refuse child support the kid would lose financial stability that would be detrimental to their academics and survival. We need better laws to be honest. Especially around marriages. We cant apply 1950s laws to current marriages as the way of thinking has changed. We need to have paternity tests at the time of birth and if the offspring is from an affair the affair partner will be held liable for the child even if the couple make up. However these laws will be strictly opposed by femnazis so we would go nowhere. Joke hai isliye possible hai. Joke nahi hota toh bhi possible hai. False rape case file karne ka punishment 1 week community service bhi nahi hai. Isko file karne mein kya lagegaüò∂ Ah the section 69 False promises are wrong. This law is good. Rape of men by women was never an offense. Not new territory sadly. Ah! the section 69 Again, unfortunately the law does not care how consent works according to us. It only cares how it works according to itself. Which was detailed in IPC but left to interpretation in BNS Isn‚Äôt that what rapis- ‚Ä¶uhm ‚Ä¶.uhm ‚Ä¶.politicians actually want Hence the laws to break genuine men so those baatards can run free Biswaguru‚Ñ¢ So why should the husband, who was wronged, pay the child support? Why can't the mother and her affair partner pay it???? Time to leave this country. Lmao it was already there in the previous sections too, nothing new i just don‚Äôt understand this, if you truly hold sex as this sacred thing that you only want to have with the man you marry, then why are you not actually waiting until you‚Äôre married? what‚Äôs the logic here? why are these women believing that a guy who has been dating them for a couple of weeks is going to end up marrying them? your comment REALLY sounds like you‚Äôre infantilising women really hard yeah that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm saying, their understanding of consent is incorrect. you can‚Äôt have conditional consent on the basis of future actions, that‚Äôs so stupid Wtf, I am soon leaving this shit country That's why it is bad. They have even removed certain sections pertaining to consent, leading to interpretation of the law to the judge. This is a joke and a downgrade to IPC. Middle class urbanites Need to kinda purge the judiciary and the legislative of these old idiots. Most of the Indian teenage and young adult men are deprived of touch, sexually frustrated and are socially awkward. Add this law, and I am pretty sure they won't even think of dating anymore. What's more jarring is that this law infantilzes women, like they are so gullible that anyone can claim them to marry and do the deed. You want women to be powerful, and then assume they are weak and need help. Decide, idiots. Women are no braindead tools, neither are men some horndogs. Even if the father didn‚Äôt know he did love the kid as his own right. I want you to look at it from this perspective, had the child been adopted and the parents get divorced will the adoptive father just say j am not the father i am not related to him/her so i wont pay? Plus imagine the psychological trauma that kid would endure on day you have loving father the next day the father hates him for no wrong doing of his own. Why must he be punished‚Ä¶ plus if you were active on true off my chest sub you will see that a lot of fathers love the kid even though the kid might be through an affair. Because they cared for the kid and love isn‚Äôt like a switch. Had they known from the start that the kid was not theirs they might not be attached hence why i said we need paternity tests at the time of birth itself As per this, if a man offer promotion and has sexual intercourse with her, then really he gives that, is that going to punish himü§£ Ab ghar par hi baitho chup chaap lol What if the girl is sleeping with others while being in the relationship? And what if the woman breaks up with me? Can I expect any jail time for her? Indian men should realize that we live in a matriarchal shithole with the entire judicial system stacked against men I am so glad i am gay üíÄüôè But lawyers ko to experience hoga na Aise hi thodi koi bhi case karke nikal lega better call saul Nothing surprising...the level of retardation is going up year by year! I dont see the issue here. Its saying if both parties are seperated and the husband sleeps with his wife without her consent shall be imprisioned. Sounds like its giving protection to women who are married in name only and are otherwise seperated. I agree there should be similar laws for men but I dont see how this one is misandric. Not a problem for most men in India because they are anyways single. Dating culture in India is fucked. This law can't make it worse. Really? First of I am not holding sex as a sacred thing cause it isn't. But I have seen many guys promise marriage and then manipulate girls to have sex. By promising marriage many gullible women are open to doing it before marriage as they feel they are doing it with their future husband. The law is clearly made to protect those gullible women from small towns and villages. I don't know how situation is in big cities. If you still think it's wrong just talk to some girls and ask if the law is bad or not. So why isn't this topic trending on twitter? this kinda shit make me leave india asap although i desperately try to not run away and make a change but how the hell does government of india keep fucking up this has too many loopholes compared to the previous law No , its only one sided as with many such laws in India ( r'pe, dv , sa etc) Ya it was considered sexual assault, which ig isn't now which is exactly they want at this stage they just trollling us lol section 69 Well, any time just one gender is supported (in this case women), it is inherently unjust (in this case misandric). All laws should be gender neutral. The letter of the law and the application of it are quite different in India. Even though the law is set up to seemingly protect women, it is generally used by entitled/rabid feminists/misandric/bitter women to file false cases on men. i‚Äôm not saying you personally, i‚Äôm using ‚Äúyou‚Äù as a general term. it‚Äôs true i don‚Äôt know what the situation is in smaller villages but i still think that for people who think of sex as something they‚Äôre supposed to do with only their life partner, it‚Äôs important to teach them to not do it before the person is your life partner. and sex IS a sacred thing to the people you‚Äôre talking about, hence why they only have it with the person they‚Äôre spending their life with. what you or i think doesn‚Äôt matter because you or i aren‚Äôt going to be in this problem in the first place. again, i think your way of thinking is infantilising women Aise cases harrasment aur blackmail ke liye karte hain Mera mummy ka bhi zameen ese hi Cheena. Threatened to file case of murder on her land, then take her to court. By that time some scrupulous builder will build a building in someone's name. And there is a law which will grant the land and building to that goon due to that someone's name. Even if it doesn't, the lawyer fees will be extremely high over the period of so many years, which makes it extremely infeasible for us middle class people It's not a fuck up when govt is warned about something bad by experts and they do it anyway right? Seems intentional then. Trans people and young men seem most vulnerable to this. Minors can still be protected by POCSO. If you'd like to improve the situation, you can always help start a citizen movement. Create a petition, make a stink. Or spread awareness in some other manner. I think enough men don't know about this. Also sexual violence against men is not considered a crime anymore So 10 years in jail is worth it for a broken promise‚Ä¶.right on retard Remember most BJP supporters have voted for this. It would be funny to see the posh, city living, upper middle class, disconnected from reality BJP fanboys getting jailed on breakup. Yup Khud shaadi nahi ki toh BC saare desh ka kaam karaga Gobi >gynocentric laws. Oh yeah, gynocentric laws in India. Known as the 'gynocentric' capital of the world because of how great it is for women. ffs you're doing a disservice to the discussion at hand by muddying the water with this Andrew Taint bullshit. *Brij Bhushan smirking from corner This means, presenring the guy with a certificate of virgbity is mandatory before dating . fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me\" Yep. This just seems as an arm wringing by the law writers to force younger men into \"traditional arranged marriages\" and stop the dating culture from all angles. PM is single Leader of opposition is also single. They want the country also to be single. ü§° They have protection from politicians so the more money and connection they have the less chances of their imprisonment If a woman promises marriage, uses you and then leaves ? They knew what they were doi hence its 69 lol But why would they want that? The middle class pays the most tax and practically makes the country functional. well modi is non-biological /s Section 69. What an irony. Section 69 is telling me it's not true and I'm too lazy to do a fact check. Either way I ain't getting any girl ..so I'm safeüòè Only if he intends to try and lie to a woman about employment etc. while having sex with her. My partner has nothing to do with my line of work and I've been honest about not wanting to marry, so I would have no concerns if I lived in India. I assume you only get any kind of punishment if you actually lied or cheated someone into having sex. This new law doesn't specify anything, leading to the interpretation of the law which is never good. Ah I haven't read this yet so idk. Thanks. This would be fair only if a woman could be jailed for the same. IE: she breaks up with him if he ISNT promoted or doesn‚Äôt get that new job, falsifies HER identity somehow, or does something to change his feelings about marriage. She could previously say that she wanted a career and not have kids, or say she wants kids and not work, but then flip flop. Even if she didn‚Äôt plan to change her mind, that‚Äôs deceitful. And what‚Äôs more, if this is a law that will take the word of the woman without any proof, then men will have to have women sign a contract before any sort of activity, even kissing. The women won‚Äôt like it, but after only a few cases, if the law doesn‚Äôt get thrown out, then the men will refuse the attention of women unless they sign a contract. Much like a prenup but even before a relationship starts. Damn those predatory women who lure men for sex and then cry rape so they can blackmail the poor boys! Will the evil of women ever stop?! /s Seriously though, the onus for proving rape lies on the woman, and there are a lot of rapists who walk free because the girl cannot sufficiently prove the guy did it. Unless she has definite proof that the guy claimed marriage/promotion/other deceitful things, the guy is safe. ‚ÄúBut the guy‚Äôs reputation is ruined‚Äù Not as much as the girl‚Äôs. It‚Äôs sad to say, but we are still a somewhat conservative nation, and we value virginity more than a man‚Äôs rape accusation. And look, I‚Äôm not saying there are unsavoury women out there who would abuse the law to screw over innocent men. But these sort of con artists abuse all sorts of laws. And it‚Äôs easier for a guy to get sex by lying to the woman than for a woman to falsely accuse a guy for rape. Need a Judicial reform in India Judiciary doesnt pass laws. >they feel they are doing it with their future husband So in other words, they are not having sex with their husband. Even if she marries that guy she still had sex outside of marriage. Any woman who really cares about only having sex after marriage will stick to that rule. And you are framing sex as though it is something that a woman \"gives\" to a man. It is an activity that both of them enjoy. She indulged in pleasure herself too when having sex. >the guy will have to prove he did not How do you prove a negative? If I show my entire chat history she can claim I deleted those messages. Even if I have voice recordings of all our conversations when we meet in person, she can claim I deleted the recording of me promising her that I will marry her. Not under new new law, this was already in IPC section 375 clause 4. And it had the added bonus of rape charge. The new laws are mostly a rename of old laws with very minute changes.. The general consensus in India is that men/boys can't be raped or sexually assaulted. Coupled with the fact that most rapes in India are perpetrated by men on women. Coupled with the fact that this is a government run by a couple of neighbourhood unkills who have manipulated the legislative process to pass these laws. Was your classmate an adult when she gave her consent to have sex though? Yep. Ye pehle se hi hai (since ages). Nothing new. Bhai onus of proving rape didn't happen lies on man. It's opposite in this case. Female just had to register a case and her verbal statement is considered enough of a proof. Bhai ye same chi female ne Kari ho is there any fucking law for that? Women get horny too if that's news to you but most would likely suppress it as that is what they are taught. So if their boyfriend keeps steeling them it's not a bug deal cause they will marry then yes they let go of that control. But since the guy lied to make them let go of control it's wrong and should be punished. Also the 2nd paragraph is so dumb. The issue is not women having sex before marriage. It's women having when they were promised marriage but end up finding it to be a lie. So now a guy can't change his mind about a relationship ? So what's the solution for you? Blame the women for having sex out of marriage because they believed the guy. Cool pls use same logic for any crime and blame the victim from now. The offence existed before as well. The supreme court has multiple times held that every break up is not automatically categorized as rape. It has also held that the since the inception of the relationship, the consent of the woman must have been built upon lies, only then will it constitute rape. Same precedents will apply to BNS S.69 because its basically the same law. Babe I don't think this is working out, we need to end things. Wakes up to rape charge filled against him. Most surprising part is there are loons unironically defending this law. It seems you are new in this country. Laws are biased here!ü•π I know but they do send some back. I also put the legislative in there. >But since the guy lied to make them let go of control it's wrong and should be punished. What a stupid statement. Ever heard of consent? If the woman is a consenting adult, then the conversation ends there. We as a society have decided that there is a certain age after which adults are responsible for their own decisions, barring any influence of substances. Which developed country has this retarded rule? >Also the 2nd paragraph is so dumb. The issue is not women having sex before marriage. If you think that's dumb then you have no idea how Indian society works. People are shamed for having sex outside of marriage - the stigma comes from there. That's the reason they feel betrayed when they are lied to, because now they are no longer a virgin. These kind of laws legitimize and perpetuate this mindset rather than weeding it out. is it really the whole picture? or are we just talking tip of the iceberg here? when farmer laws were passed, there were massive protests. why, then, if this law is as baseless and biased as people are making it to be, is it not a bigger issue? only came across this on reddit, not even in newspapers. i try not to take social media things too seriously. but if it is indeed the whole picture, then there should be a document that's supposed to be signed to take note of the nature of relationship, casual or serious. maybe a formal agreement every time before you decide to have coitus too. What 'certain' sections are you talking about? A good lawyer can easily dispute the claim. And no judge will convict a person just because a woman says he did it. It‚Äôs too absurd. The irony of the section! No section 69 if you get married. so essentially lesser evil or greater good sorts? rather have a few men behind the bars and many woman being able to live better lives than the opposite. That's why I am not on tinder üòú Consent based on lie dumbass. What do you mean consent means you can get away with anything? Do you even know how many are forced to have sex for job, blackmail, financial help during emergency, but since they end up consenting doesn't make it okay. Try focusing on helping victim instead of the culprits who lie to get what they want. About stigma then yes society is fucked and women are openly asked before marriage if they are virgins or not and they even put white bedsheets for first night to check blood stain. The law is not responsible to change society as only proper education will stop people from thinking like cavemen. Bhai yha rape hua hu nhi and sex is normal in relationships. Breakup do happen so kya prove krega lawyer? Meri gf agar abusive ho gayi even then I can't breakup with her cuz she has a perfect law in her favour. Not to mention just FIR will mess up a guy's life if he is a normal middle class person. What happens when the woman does the same? No law against her? In my opinion they should do something about the rapes and false allegations of rape inspite of bs uh, no? obviously don‚Äôt blame the woman but also don‚Äôt make the woman completely handicapped to make her own decisions. do you think this law is going to solve this issue? there‚Äôs laws that say SA is illegal too doesn‚Äôt stop it from happening. if you actually want to solve the issue and not just put a bandaid over it then start grassroot orgs that empower women and teach them not be so flippant with decisions they think are important. this is the very basic of any kind of social work and upliftment. you cannot make lying to somebody illegal be for fucking real. what‚Äôs next? thought policing? this is nothing but a way to stop people from dating for any reason other than marriage. good luck trying to revert back the the 18th century. Judges aren‚Äôt robots. The guy can explain that he wanted to get married, had sex, but then something happened that changed his mind and so he wants to break up with her, and she‚Äôs accusing him of rape to her back at him. Rape isn‚Äôt some civil offence, it a criminal act and the judge can‚Äôt declare someone a criminal just for changing his mind. And it‚Äôs easy to look at this text and think it‚Äôs sexist against men, but similar laws are present in America and Europe, and while I‚Äôm sure there are cases where a woman falsely accused a man of rape and won, it‚Äôs in the minority. Most women know falsely accusing men of rape more likely fails than succeeds, which is why more men rape women than women falsely accusing men of rape. even as a feminist you can't defend such crap Bros its better to be single now. You never know when people change & fuck your life. >Do you even know how many are forced to have sex for job, blackmail, financial help during emergency, but since they end up consenting doesn't make it okay. Yes dumbfuck, that's literally the point I'm making. Sex is not a transaction. It's an activity mutually enjoyed by both parties. If the woman doesn't want to have sex outside of marriage, it's her responsibility to say no. Again, which developed country has this retarded law? Or forget developed, which developing country has this retarded law? If you provide an example I will admit I was wrong and go away. >Try focusing on helping victim instead of the culprits who lie to get what they want. She's a victim of what? Having consensual sex? Falling for a lie? You make it sound like she's 6 years old and has no idea what she's doing. >The law is not responsible to change society The law literally dictates the norms that are acceptable to society. It's literally used for delivering justice, and the conversations that arise about legal proceedings and the resulting judgements absolutely serve as a vehicle for change in society. Thats what they‚Äôll realise when it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs similar to killing slaves, in a sense. Ok but what if woman marries by suppressing identity? This also happens a lot here How is this going to stop dating? Just stay away from psychos who would just file case just to mess up your life. Isn't there laws like this USA to where women can simply claim that they never gave consent and has dating stopped there? Vishvaguru moment If accusing men of rape was that easy then all women would do it. Why is rape culture more prevalent than women-falsely-accusing-men culture? Because it‚Äôs easier for a man to get away with rape than a woman falsely accusing a man of rape. It‚Äôs easier for a man to lie to a woman for sex than a woman to falsely accuse you of rape. Think of it like bribery. It‚Äôs easier to take a bribe and get away with it than it is of framing an innocent man of taking bribes. So basically 69 could land you in jail under section 69 Corny They are not even legally married i think r/theyknew This is obviously only a crack down on love marriages that parents are dead against. While this is the law, it'll only be implemented to harass intercaste/ inter-religion couples that want to marry. The girl's parents can now simply file a complaint and boom guy and guy's family in trouble. It's sick that they're using the law to sit and moral police us like this. It's even more disgusting that it's called section 69. They're clearly trolling us and treating us like lowly peasants that have to live in fear constantly. Man. I hate this govt and whoever proposed this. I really don't want to live in a Hindu version of Iran / Saudi. This really sucks. so now murder and breakup mean the same? thus the refrigerator guy is no different from breakup guy anyways those who wanna fool around will have always means and ways. its the favorite time pass of guys. One more reason to leave this country asap And a women can cut your private parts and nothing will happen to her And going by your login if walking away after raping was so easy then why don't every man just go around raping?. Reason not everyone is morally bankrupt as of now. Same with majority of women. But this new law will definitely increase the number of women misusing law to force some better man to get into marriage with her and what not. Why \"Jai Hind\"? Which law? So if you are deceived it's okay. Like no issue, it's your fault for believing. Sounds a lot like how people always tend to blame women for rapes. Totally okay as its the girls fault and it's so rare and never happens which why it's stupid of Indian lawmakers to make this a law. Right???????? And yes she is a victim just like how consumer courts laws are made to help people who were deceived. And next try to not thinking about 6 years old while talking about sex. Law can't dictate how society thinks. Society develops over time and things can always be changed and improved over time. But for now this is an issue or else laws won't be made for something doesn't happen. Your denying doesn't make a difference. Your defensiveness seems to come from a place of guilt but you can accept that you are now a criminal so yes argue all you want. Shaadi karke biwi ko abandon kiya hai non-bio nay. What about the other way around? Why do laws have to be gender specific? Although I don't agree with the law drafted as such, at least equality shouldn't be hard enough to crafted. As usual, the law will be useless for those who are truly targeted to be beneficial for and will be unnecessarily weaponized against others. Where does burden of proof lie ? The guy is fed up and wants to break up ? - awesome sue him or worst tell him that marry me or I will sue you and make your life hell. Feminazis are destroying the concept of equality and wrongly using these laws. Idk why women are given so privileges and sheltered so much here, what about the other way round, lady traps the man just to have sex and then trashes him away...this country and its lawmakers have wits equivalent to a toddler's, mere appeasement nothing else... Ig the woman who chopped off guy's dick cuz he refused to marry wouldn't be charged much either, its as if men are inferior species, woman is only human. Section 69, lol >Sounds a lot like how people always tend to blame women for rapes. Totally okay as its the girls fault How are you equating this to rape? If she didn't give her consent, that's a clear cut crime anywhere in the world. >And yes she is a victim just like how consumer courts laws are made to help people who were deceived Consumer courts were made for people who were deceived in monetary transactions. You keep equating sex to transactions, which it is not. The only way this makes any sense is if there was some kind of written contract where a man has promised to marry her in exchange for sex, which also would not be criminally enforceable, it would be a civil matter. >And next try to not thinking about 6 years old while talking about sex. Next time try to not treat women like 6 year olds who can be easily manipulated and have no agency of their own, and I will stop calling it out. >Your defensiveness seems to come from a place of guilt It's called being critical of a stupid law, which again, is not found anywhere else in the world. Don't want to have sex outside of marriage? Just stick to that rule. If you don't, you have to face the consequences of your own actions, which you enjoyed as much as the man did. You didn't lose anything, except a man who didn't want to marry you anyway. Yes. But she was under the belief that they were gonna have a love marriage. Most rapes in India is perpetrated by men on women is probably a false notion. In terms of sexual assault as far as I have seen it is equal. I have met many victims of rape done by women. The point is that there is no data on this and nothing can be claimed. Are you serious? The gap between these two statistics is astronomically large. Male on female rapes happen more. That's a fact, and not just in India. Pretty sure this violates Article 21 in a way. I don't see this holding up in the court of law. Why not? No. That‚Äôs the loophole. You can‚Äôt dupe someone under the pretext of marriage when the marriage doesn‚Äôt exist under the law! Check mate! at this point, I'm not even surprised Needs a woman lawyer. Cannot file a similar case against her going by the law I guess! She gave 'consent based on lie' which is crime everywhere. Go Google it. Only women who have probably lived in big cities are free thinking and understand sex is just that, sex and nothing else. But since there so many who think sex is sacred, it's obvious that lying to make them give up the urge to have sex is obviously wrong and now illegal. Dude you keep saying she is not victim but she is. Like I said if this was super super rare there wouldn't be a law. Obviously this is happening a lot so we now have a law to stop it. If an issue can be solved with this law then how is it bad? It may be a bandaid but unless you expect women and society to fast forward their mentality to 50-60 years then good luck. Depends on what your ‚Äúsocial media circle‚Äù is. If you follow more content from women on gender issues, you‚Äôll see more women taking up these issues than man. Look my friend is a lawyer and it is very easy for women to put false rape case and a lot of cases are like that and they see these in court everyday. Just the thing we need in midst of the loneliness pandemic among teenagers and young adults. Chef‚Äôs kiss. /s I meant the general people we follow on socials. Friends, relatives, batchmates, acquaintances etc. Normal people, a mixed varied crowd, not social justice influencers with a niche. Saw lots of female peers posting about this from news sites, but not a single male peer. Have your male friends done it? Because that would be great. I don't see a single male friend talking about it when we hang out. I wonder if they find it emasculating to talk about a very real vulnerability now. Another way to trap innocent men I am not on social media so wouldn‚Äôt know if they posted it, however, they do talk about it. They are slightly afraid too, and a lot more desensitised because (there words, not mine) ‚ÄúBhai kya hi fayda hi. Kuch bolo to 10 log comment kar dete hain ki ‚Äòhow does it feel to get a taste of helplessness which women have faced for millennia‚Äô, isse achcha hai bhagwaan se manao ki gf/wife jo miley vo sane ho. Baaki toh golden rule don‚Äôt put your d in crazy hai hi‚Äù Dont know why everyone is silent. New criminal laws are outright criminally against our fundamental freedoms and rights New Broadcast and Digital Bills will snatch away your Internet freedoms New criminal laws require everything to be digitised and it is one data breach leak away from destroying your lives New cRiminal laws accept digital evidence too, Good luck if you dont know what cryptographic hashing is, and what the procedures are for safe seizure without leading to data manipulation Good luck if they plant data Goodluck. Why are you crying about marital rape being a crime Or just text her everyday. You're not looking for marriage. >If an issue can be solved with this law then how is it bad? Because it creates an entirely new issue where women can claim that men who break up with them promised to marry them and left them even if he didn't. There are so many cases where women use this law to blackmail men into doing something. I'd say an unfulfilled promise is a lot better situation being imprisoned for 10 years for something you didn't even do. Also, under the eyes of this law, what's the difference between a man who had second thoughts about the woman who he was sure he was going to marry, and a man who has outright deceived a woman? I care about the laws being gender neutral. I bet a lot of them are dismissed due to lack of evidence, else we‚Äôd hear a lot more about it. What in the flying f*ck? I can see unimaginable number of false claims as well! Break up would also mean false promise of marriage! This is correct. Men can‚Äôt use women like Kleenex Like I said right at the beginning. If the law simply takes what the woman claims then it's wrong. If the law specifies only written or witness proof then it's a good law. That's all. Plus this issue exists in weather countries too. Women can simply claim they never gave consent and the guy goes to jail. The reason most countries have laws like this is protect the true victims who are many unlike the few make victims. To guys all I can say think with your brain instead of your penis and everything will be okay. Actually nope, what happens is that usually there are WhatsApp msgs and phone call recordings etc as evidence. So there is a lot of evidence in these cases. sometimes feels good that women cannot be thrown into trash by fcbois, at the same time terrifying that itll be misused like always. At this point staying away from everything might be best thing just like women should stay away from liars who will go on to not marry them after having sex with them? no, there are no laws in the US that legitimise conditional consent based on future events. that‚Äôs absolutely insane in ANY normal developed country. it‚Äôs also not how consent works. when you consent to a sexual act, you do it IN THE MOMENT on your terms without future clauses. you can‚Äôt say ‚Äúi‚Äôm consenting to having sex with you if you do that in the future‚Äù and then take your consent away when the other person doesn‚Äôt do what you wanted. consent is not conditional like that. the US is also not a puritanical and hyper conservative country like ours. so there is no relevance to comparing our country with theirs. they don‚Äôt have the concept of arranged marriages. Just because men aren't given protection doesn't mean that the laws made for women are shitty. Ask for gender neutral laws instead of hating on others india is definitely getting fucked in every sense of life other than food .. like education, employment, privacy, costs, taxes, development, brainwashing & whatnot and now even interfering in personal relationships that‚Äôs exactly what it is Women should stay away but it's not like they have degree in judging if a person is lying or not. Almost every arrange marriage have sex before marriage saying things like we are going to be married so why wait. That is why many women give in. Plus consent based on lie is illegal in every developed country. Only people who lie to get consent have issue with this. Like I said before women also have urge to have sex which they control as they fear society's wrath but when someone promises to marry they trust them because I dunno maybe women are too trusting. Either way they give in to the urge based on lie and consent based on lie is crime so this law isn't bad. The only way for this law to be bad is if law allows women to claim to be a victim without proof. They are inherently shitty. Anything that's done at the expense of another gender is. Create several laws specifically favouring men and then let's come back and have this discussion. If you promise to marry the girl just to get her consent to sleep with you and then you leave her after sex that will be a criminal offense. People need to know the whole context before running a narrative. for example, if you have seen the case of munawar ayesha in bigboss. If you and your partner are sexually active without any marriage commitment then no issue. Problem is only when you are looking just have sex with her and you promise her you will marry her so she agrees to sleep with you and then you leave her. A law from Section 69 üòÇ can never be taken seriously. Moreover, the implications of the law defy all logic. I think Amit shah is behind this masterpiece. This carries the same amount of imprisonment years as a minimum rape charges. So the govt wants Indian men to rape instead‚Ä¶ Rape bhadhao desh bachao. Well in 69 , the ladies have the leverage. Men should take the victim blaming advice women abuse survivors are given by society at large: make better choices and you won't be hurt. yeah lies based on sexual or reproductive health, not promises LMAO. if you lie to somebody and don‚Äôt inform them when you have an STD then their consent is invalid, if you lie to somebody about using a contraceptive then their consent is invalid. not ‚Äúif you have sex with me i‚Äôll give you this‚Äù. your consent is not invalid in that scenario because they didn‚Äôt give you whatever you wanted, because sex is not a transaction or currency. let‚Äôs say that a couple agree to have sex because they‚Äôre on the path to marriage, and then later on they realise that they‚Äôre not compatible, or one person realises they‚Äôre not ready for marriage, or they fall in love with somebody else and end up doing the right thing by breaking it off. what then? you just HAVE to get married to the person you slept with, no choice? you understand how highly damaging it is to society as a whole to view marriage as this business transaction and not a union of two people in love? the less the government meddles in our personal relationships, the better. we shouldn‚Äôt be involving the government in marriages in such an intrinsic way anyway, telling us who can legally get married to whom, who should be punished for not marrying or marrying somebody‚Ä¶ by all means, safeguard victims and give them the help they need, but this is not any kind of a logical move. ‚Äúwomen have the urge to have sex too‚Äù exactly. so they‚Äôre making the decision based on THEIR OWN wants. you cannot blame another party when you are doing what you WANT to do. People have lost jobs, just due to allegations. Not even conviction. You think everyone has the time & resources to battle it out in court? Not to mention, the mental suffering from all of this. Be realistic. > false promise of employment or promotion. So they are saying that actually promoting or employing women for sex is fine!? But they routinely ignore rape unless 200 women show up with brooms. Nothing üòÅ. They have removed Adultery as a crime. Even previously, adultery was punishable to Man only. You can say the law is Extremely biased towards women. Its her choice! Sad but true. No it was never there. Even previously in Adultery, only Man was punishable. Yes the law is highly biased towards women. Its her choice. She can do whatever she wants üòú What they should have done instead: 1. Sex Education beyond biology: how people, especially girls shouldn‚Äôt succumb to pressure, how they should be ready and comfortable. 2. Educate that girls who do end up having pre marital sex are not a ‚Äúshame to the society and family‚Äù. Their izzat isn‚Äôt lut gayi or whatever. 3. Stronger crackdown on revenge Porn and cyber crimes But these require time and strategy. Passing a stupid law that can easily be misused, avoid people from relationships altogether and falling in love, cause fear amongst people is easier smh. Now as soon as you meet up for a date, first sign documents that no charges will be filed But it is in Indian religion to allow sexual freedom. Whytf does the Kama Sutra exist if not for enjoying (including casual) sex to the maximum? Bruh, don‚Äôt demonise half the population. Stop thinking from your perspective and try thinking of the huge number of women who obviously go through this issue. Instead of saying actions of your consequences you should try thinking how much impact it puts on them. The government isn't meddling like when they were trying to make live in relationship forms. This is a law to help women who are being cheated and I for one am happy that these scumbags will be thrown to jail. Again if the law is implemented correctly like asking for proper proof before issuing FIR then good or else it will be bad. Laws are getting worse for men When the policymakers are denser than lead How about you can‚Äôt rape anyone, regardless of gender, sex, or marital status. This law implies that it‚Äôs legal to rape your wife/husband. The problem is, women are idiots. You tell them we should spend more time together and they'll start thinking the names of the babies and how many guests to invite to their wedding. The section doesn't specify what could be considered a promise of marriage. And the policymakers are also mostly men Time for men in india to go their own way. Don't get into relationship with women or marry women! Don't show up for arranged marriages! Put your foot down! Fight for your rights! That will teach us women a lesson üòù Rape and sexual assault doesn't apply to men in India; there's no law for it. Okay , I am ordering a silicon Doll. Thanks to all policy makers. This is just source - trust me bro üòÇüòÇüòÇ You want realistic? Men want to trick women into sleeping with them, so that they could leave them with no consequences. The women they leave will feel dirty, and their family would blame them for falling for such an obvious lie. And now that she isn‚Äôt a virgin, she will be considered less than a woman and will be forced to marry someone she doesn‚Äôt love, because she lost her virginity to a conman. You say women would abuse this law to trap vulnerable men. I say we don‚Äôt need this law, men can trap vulnerable women and get away with it despite the law. And eliminating it would only empower such men. This is what happens when laws are made by old, out-of-touch, patriarchal misogynists masquerading as the \"protectors\" of women. They do this with full confidence that they will never be impacted by the laws they create when they are easily the biggest offenders. At least publicly they have to show off that they have morals to compensate for the private atrocities they commit. Was it ever considered a crime? Feminists are liberals always pushed back against recognising it as a crime. Never was and never will be. There's no point of love in India. Mera Bharat Mahan!!! do the women need to prove that marriage was promised, or is it on the guy to prove innocence? also a few engagements break off before marriage, are you basically fucked in that case? Why the /s ? You think we're joking around in here? Sure you make fair points but doesn't this law set questionable precedence for the concept of consent and that it can be conditional and revoked afterwards on whim and that only gender gets to make that. Additionally it also seems to say that people in positions of power are allowed to trade sex for promotion and other benefits? Universal acceptance on something doesn't make it less sexist also there's a heavy implication that the west somehow has monopoly on morality You're lashing out at the wrong targets, either due to ignorance or bias. 1) The laws that don't acknowledge that men can be victims were established by, and are predominantly upheld by, men - none of whom were/are feminists. 2) Feminists actually fight for male rape victims and are against patriarchal ideas like men cannot be victims or women cannot be predators. 3) Conservatives are doing squat for male victims. Liberal countries are more likely to recognise make victims. Judiciary? Isn't the Legislature(ie. Govt) the architect of new laws in the country? Judiciary is only the executioner of those laws.. last i read in civics. From what I could gather, both the woman and man have to put forth the evidence. But one thing the woman's side of court will need to put forth for the conviction is the intent of the man of deception, meaning he not only lied but also promised marriage. Secondly, this only seems to apply for instances where sexual intercourse took place, and I don't think most arranged engagements get to that point before marriage. First, terms like \"conservative\" don't apply in Indian context because right wing folks in India don't ask for upholding the status quo. Second, there's evidence of feminist groups pushing back against this. Western liberal countries are likely to recognise male victims. That's true. But I don't see how that's relevant in Indian context. You dont understand. For the real rapist, the jail is the punishment (seldom achieved). However for random middle class man, the court hearings and pending case on BGV is the punishment. Even if innocence is proved it will take many years lost of the career. So it doesnt really matter if a lot of rapists walk free (I mean it does matter overall but in the scope of the middle class impact of this law it doesnt) since the common man will be punished by so called due process of law anyways. I mean deceiving in one wrong thing.. But going to jail for this? What if the allegations are false? How will it work then? Also this is my own opinion but.. This law is promoting \"purity/virginity\" bs. cause why sexual intercourse will be the singular factor for marriage?? Nah I don't support this.. Nowhere does it say feminists pushed back against it, because that would be against the basic tenants of feminism. 'Women's groups and human rights groups' is such a vague descriptor. The vast majority of human rights and feminist groups are actually pushing for justice for male victims. Like literally, one of the core agendas of feminism is fighting against toxic masculinity which harms both men and women. This includes notions like men can't be victims, men should not express emotions or men should be the primary breadwinners. biggest cukblock ever!! \"Hey Babe, I may or MAY NOT marry you, just so you know.\" There ya go. Easy fix. Gets mad at some clown abusing the law Gives a free pass to the clowns in parliament making the law. Gives a free pass to the police prosecuting the law in their own fucked up corrupt , patriarchal way of thinking men cant be victims Gives a free pass to the courts passing judgements based on their on their unique slow moving fucked uppedness Society does not take crimes against men seriously -> proceeds to argue women are the problem Bitches be crazy vro Look at it from the other gender. You say consent is dubious, but what if the woman only wants to lose her virginity to her soulmate. And this guy says he loves her, it seems they would get married, she‚Äôs happy, and when he convinces her, they have sex. But after the sex he changes his mind and leaves her. Doesn‚Äôt it seem he‚Äôs just conning her for sex? And in a country that‚Äôs still pretty conservative, wouldn‚Äôt people look down on her because of her past relationship? Let‚Äôs face it, men and women aren‚Äôt equal, but women are placed in a worse position. If it comes out that she‚Äôs not a virgin, society looks down on her. Women have always been at a disadvantage when it comes to sexual relationships. This law helps keep some agency back to them. Instead, you look at this as though it‚Äôs oppressing men. As for that ‚Äúallowed to trade sex for positions of power‚Äù no it doesn‚Äôt? It‚Äôs basically saying if a guy tricks a woman to have sex with him, he will get punished. Saying it legalises sex themed bribery is fucking stupid. Why don‚Äôt you guys just start with punishing all the rape? Seems like a more logical first step. Men who trick women into sleeping with them exist, women who abuse the law to trap men also exist. Both the victims in these cases regarless of gender deserve justice, or do you believe only one section does? Why can't laws be gender neutral? Laws can't be gender neutral when only one gender has to pay the price to carry a baby for 9 months and the other can make 10 more babies in a single day with 10 different women. So, friendly fire? I bet it ll get used against women way more. If a girl dumps, she gets violently attacked. I can imagine the incels filing a this case against her. Not really, it's a very well thought out divide and rule policy. And they know these laws don't apply to them and can get away with anything. You're wrong Indian government worship women they're completely biased against men you should do some research how many of men are suffering even if all the proofs that they have done nothing wrong raise your voice or suffer with everyone your time will come too And what of the common woman, who gets tricked into sex with promises of marriage, only to be abandoned once the man gets bored? Do you think it‚Äôs her fault for giving her virginity so easily? That if society looks down on her, then it‚Äôs her fault? Doesn‚Äôt she deserve justice? And that‚Äôs not even counting the fact that she might get pregnant and has to take care of a child that‚Äôs abandoned by her husband. It‚Äôs sad that you care so much about the injustice to the common man, but not about the common woman who may suffer worse. Indian laws and judiciary thinks women can never be wrong it's only men fault always they keep making laws that would be missused against all men only to harass and get revenge Men needs to take justice by themselves forcefully if judiciary failed to provide them justice Wo bhi illegal hai modi's biggest voter base. crazy To be fair, it is an upgrade. In the older law, this supposed crime would have been called \"rape under pretext of marriage,\" and the convict would have been labeled as a rapist. Statements by judges where teenage boys and younger men were jailed under rape charges for refusing to marry their abuser, i.e., the older women who groomed them, were not unheard of when the old laws were in place. Therefore, I don't see how the old laws were better. >but what if the woman only wants to lose her virginity to her soulmate. I can think of a few ways to improve the odds, so can you but there's no way to ensure such a thing as divorce is always possible. Why are you treating women like they have no agency in this hypothetical situation? And it's not like wanting commitment is a fundamental right or something, if anything commitments of any form flies directly in the face of a fundamental right that is freedom unless the commitment is agreed upon mutually. If anything, everyone should have sex knowing that their partner can decide anything there after. Stop treating women with kiddie gloves. Having sex is a choice and it comes with consequences, personal responsibility ya know? >Women have always been at a disadvantage when it comes to sexual relationships. Sure, that's why women have always been more selective while deciding partners. Guaranteeing enforced commitment doesn't give them their agency back I have said it once and I will say it again - this specific law fails miserably in what it's trying to achieve. I used to think this law was needed in rural areas because virginity is given a lot of importance? But after thinking it through, I think this law is pretty flawed. Like what kind of proof will be acceptable in this regard? As you already said, if a guy says \"we are gonna live together forever\" and seeing that the girl decides to have sex with him, then in that case I don't think the guy is guilty at all. Relationships fail all the time :/ because they are, lets be honest, the most retarded of our country. The poor and rural are just too uneducated, the rich are educated and mostly socially liberalised, but these people cling to the dredges of dried up hinduism and consume it asif they're next in line to fuck apsara's in swarga. but why? What are they pulling here? but they could always run free. That's why boys, strive for excellence, knowledge, money, power and hunger for good things. Abhi ke time mai ladkiyon ke peeche bhagoge toh disappointment alag se milegi, pehle jail hone ke chances hai. Aur sex hi karna hai toh paise de kar kar dena. Sorry to say this, but truth is truth. 3000 rs ke aage 10 yrs in jail bohot choti cheez hai. Chahiye to seal packed maal le 20000 de kar. I'm definitely aiming to become a sorcerer in this life, This law gives me a new found motivation. No clue, but aap RTI karke possibly jaankari le sakte ho of meeting minutes, drafts, objections etc of the particular section before it became law. What experts suggested, the 'official' reasoning used by committees to not integrate it, ye sab likely documented hai somewhere. Marital rape is still legal, what weird laws. :/ What if promise was true but later you changed your mind ? Let‚Äôs just enforce the existing laws on rape and sexual assault. That‚Äôs not being done already and now they want to enact more laws they won‚Äôt enforce. This just lip service and nothing actually is being done to protect women in India. The change needed is a cultural one, where women are not treated as property and given equal status to that of men in all aspects of society. No government or laws can fix that issue. It's hard to feel sad for him when you know that women are treated worse then cows in India. Better call Saul! But bro how will you prove the statement that you had a relationship without a pretense to marry? What if one fine day your female partner heckles you to marry or else face charges of section 69? Assuming you only had verbal agreements, it will not stand in court / police statement that you did not deceive your partner... Just by reading this section anyone can understand it is one sided weighted, favouring the women. We already have numerous fake feminist activists and this is gonna be a weapon to them. I hope there may be provision regarding opportunity for men to put their version too but if not then Males in India will suffer a silent Killing. No wonder why middle class Indian Males do not want to marry. It is a genuine problem that many females use the false pretense of fake rape cases and the man and his family has to suffer mentally, financially & societal pressure. Execute the executioner Responsibility is a two way street.. SECTION 69 !!!! It's ok, mai aapne haat se Kam chala lunga Also, there are cases in recent years where women have been prosecuted for false allegations. It's difficult to prove a rape allegation was made out of malice. So what you are asking for is already there. If you want rape laws to be gender neutral, that should be brought about. I might get hated for this but we need a law to control the lower class(beggars) population. I've seen it soo many times it's a family of 4 people are there are like 8-9 kids. That's isn't even benefitting the country man these 8-9 kids will 99% of the time continue to be a beggar and the cycle goes on Meanwhile SC casually asking girls why they were wearing short dress when they get sexually assaulted.Government is literally incentivising rape at this point Man as a guy living in India I hate how skewed the laws are becoming in the favour of the female gender. No this isn‚Äôt an Andrew Tate like rant where I‚Äôm asserting that females are evil but come on man. Are we seriously supposed to just give up? What about legislating some laws wherein a female is punished if she files a fake case of sexual assault on a man? (as many do) I‚Äôm not entirely sure about what the law is like concerning a man having more than 1 girlfriend (although I‚Äôve read some articles concerning the same wherein the man would be imprisoned if caught doing so) what about women who have more than 1 boyfriend? Man, I swear to God every day as a country we seem to be regressing further and further. Irony or on purpose? What kinda sad pathetic women wanted this? Exactly, similar law existed before as well Sure, Amit Shah started the meeting by saying \"how can we get Indian men to ra*e women? Think team, think hard. Next meeting is on 2 days when I want to hear at least 2 suggestions from everyone.\" I mean, I dislike the guy from the deepest depths of my heart & soul, but come on.. Maybe in a country where 73% of registered rape cases are fake.. at that point of time the judiciary can't make such a law which will make it 90% Fucking shit More power to already over powered women. Hey I just connected two things and it lead to an extreme example. Not pretty but still true. > But bro how will you prove the statement that you had a relationship without a pretense to marry? > > Because I've been explicitly, vocally clear that I didn't want to marry. Even if I hadn't, I don't buy that there's an implicit promise to marry, which could land me in jail eventually with this law. >What if one fine day your female partner heckles you to marry or else face charges of section 69? Then we'd have a clear, honest, explicit conversation. If you don't want to marry, be open about it. What's the issue? >Assuming you only had verbal agreements, it will not stand in court / police statement that you did not deceive your partner... Why wouldn't it? Why would you assume there's an assumption of a promise of marriage? You're scared of shadows. Sure, taken to the most insane and stupid extreme, what you worry about could happen. I don't believe judges are broadly and generally that insane or stupid. Do you? The government of India is making anything fun as illegal at this point üòÅ Yes this is an upgrade indeed, but not the upgrade we desire. The ways it can be misused are numerous and that's what make this a bad law. There absence of ways one can prove innocence on a short notice, meaning a longer court case which directly equals the inability of the man to get a job he deserves: because most companies don't employ people with criminal cases against them. And not to mention the one sided gender narrative of the law. The impact on women empowerment might be good, but it does not give the right to abuse only men using this law. Na sex karuga na karne dunga But i do know where they don't have a leverage at - r*pe cases, coz lawyers think its already fair. Shithole >Ask for gender neutral laws instead of hating on others That's what he said in the follow up comment. They do, if your social circle is twoxindia, you won't see such issues brought up or talk by males because males aren't allowed there. It's being talked about on onexindia tho. Ohhhh, I finally get why this law was passed. Prudish hags wanted youngsters to not engage in live-in relationships so they passed this law. Every day that goes by this country steps and slips on new gobar. time to leave the country while we can Everyday after I turned 18, I have started to not like this country anymore. God please protect men. Guys when will someone in this country listen to our problems, I fucking hate this country now, Thankyou government As a woman, what needs to change is the whole concept of looking down on a woman because she's no longer a virgin. This putting virginity on a pedestal and acting as if sex is a sacrifice women have to make for marriage/love is frankly disturbing. Its what resulted in this law, and it's also what tells women they can not and should not enjoy sex, much less sex outside a framework of marriage. Fuck that. Women can enjoy sex, it's ok if you have sex just to have sex, and it's also important to teach that it's not a duty to your husband or a price you have to pay to be married. This law goes directly against that. waaaaah ‚Ä¶ more ammunition for arranged marriage miscreants The former IPC was also biased against men. Any woman could file a rape charge even for consensual sex and then the onus would be on the man to prove otherwise Ye, I don't think the people who claim this is protecting women realise how badly it reduces women's agency on top of potentially screwing over men (the latter is obvious the bigger problem here). This is putting virginity on a pedestal and acting as if sex is a sacrifice women have to make for marriage/love is frankly disturbing. Its what resulted in this law, and it's also what tells women they can not and should not enjoy sex, much less sex outside a framework of marriage. Adding to that, very few women who face the most stigma from society due to loss of virginity will actually seek redress under this law because it forces them to admit they had sex. It will mostly be used by vengeful women, not ones who were genuinely deceived. As for the promotion, employment etc, that should really fall under normal sexual assault laws and not lumped together with normal relationships. Offering promotion or employment for sex should be coercion and fall under sexual assault laws (regardless of if they give people that) and not lumped in together with just normal relationships though. It's not your opinion. This law absolutely is rooted in the purity bs and assumes sex is something a woman doesn't enjoy but a price she pays for marriage. Also I'm sure many women who genuinely believe loss of virginity means their life is ruined will come forward and admit they're no longer a virgin. Totally the majority of cases filed will not just be women who are vengeful instead of women who were genuinely deceived and believe it ruined their life. What is really needed is to spread awareness of how consent works, destigmatizing sex outside a framework of marriage and getting rid of that virginity bs. But that takes time and actual work. Also, would many women from communities where this is equivalent to ruined life will come forward to admit they're \"ruined\" in the first place? Because they're lying. I support this law, but I'm not Indian. See, what they should do instead of this bs is teach kids about consent and teach girls that sex is not a price to be paid but something you can enjoy with or without marriage. We as a society need to accept a woman's life is not ruined if she's no longer a virgin or had pre-marital sex instead of passing laws to reinforce that shitty idea. >Because they're lying. I support this law, but I'm not Indian. Who's lying? And why do you support the law? Law still sucks even if it's for both genders. The solution to all this is pretty much societal change - a lot of Indians still believe a woman who has pre-marital sex is ruined for marriage and places a lot of value on a woman's virginity. That's the whole basis for this law. Sex is a price the woman has to pay for marriage. Thats also why the law is not gender-neutral because a man's sexual life is not held to the same scrutiny as a woman's (though you're of course called characterless by some, but it doesn't ruin you for marriage to others). But this mentality is dangerous both for men and for women. The law it spawned is obviously much worse for men, not debating that. But it also reinforces these ideas about purity and sex as a sacrifice for women. A better way would have been to teach about consent and safe sex and to work on destigmatizing sex without marriage as a whole. And of course, the whole woman's virginity is important thing. But ig that's too hard. Good luck proving intention in the court What a coincidence that such a law is named Law 69 The men wouldbe lying to get sex from women who think they're getting married. That's wrong imo. Because you're not an Indian, you're likely pretty naive and unfamiliar with the laws and how they're handled. Many of these laws are misused by women to file false cases. With new laws like these, the burden on the justice system would be ridiculous and awash with a million false cases in the coming decades. > But that takes time and actual work. Yups that's the conclusion I reached too. Chicken tikka what the fuck Section 69 This was much needed. Guy just take signature from the girl before having sex. >Having sex is a choice and it comes with consequences, personal responsibility ya know? I know. That's why men should not sleep with women who may cry rape later. Oh wait, that's wrong. Men should be allowed to do that. It's the women who should be more responsible with who they sleep with, and if they're tricked into sex, it's their bad decision. /S But that's the crux of it. Women who get tricked into sex and shunned by society should face the consequences , but men who have sex but later accused of rape should be protected./S >Guaranteeing enforced commitment doesn't give them their agency back Sure, but at least it protects them from predators who just want them for sex, only to discard them once they get it. If you don't get the point that commitment is not a right and you can't practically rob someone of their choice just to keep another person for feeling used then what's the point of living in a free country? And who decided that a woman's right to deny certain freedom takes precedence over a man's right to change his mind for whatever reason. And again you yourself call it rape when by all definition of rape it clearly isn't. Heck how do we expect people to respect consent in a country that doesn't even respect the concept of consent. So we should bend over backwards and trivialise rape before women take some personal responsibility, are they not adults? The law is supposed to protect women from predatory pick up artists who just want to trick women into sex, only to discard them later. Same law not applicable to women? if paramatma tells your atma to do so, then it is ok! The solution is to teach women sex isn't a price you pay for love or marriage and instead something you do because you genuinely enjoy it, not to make laws that have a high chance of being misused. What if the pua doesn't promise marriage but instead just tells you he loves you to manipulate you? And if it's only marriage that matters, you can just... Not have sex before marriage because you feel pressured to (ties back into properly teaching about consent). This law is a nothingburger that won't stop people from being manipulated. The whole law comes down to shitty \"a woman is ruined if she loses her virginity\" and frankly infantalises women. I say this as a woman myself. The solution here is to promote social change to reduce sexual repression in both genders and emphasis on purity culture for women. You are so blinded by the concept of evil women trapping innocent men into marriage that you can't see that men abuse the concept of consent to trick women into sex only to discard them later. And that means arguing with you is worthless. I don't give a fuck about men or women, I care about equality and personal responsibility. And again right to not be manipulated is not a fundamental right but the right to choose is (extension of right to be free). Arguing about something as basic is indeed pointless The leaders of this country have lost it. Just leave the country the best decision for men. Law is just a joke in this country Wow! ü§°ü§° Its like get a liscense to fuck or go in jail Mujhe kiya meri toh galfrend nahi hai I don't think it's about preference for most men, they will be single anywho We need to stop modi before he takes us back to the stone age Law for men in india is a joke! There aren‚Äôt such laws in the USA. You just made crap up. Shame on you for justifying male rape. Retarded Vakil here. This was already there in the IPC, not much of a difference now. Bruh I rejoined reddit like 3 days ago after a yearlong gap. How is anonymous people on Reddit a social circle? The latter refers to people IRL you actually know. Step out of Reddit üòÇ Where the heck did you get that stat dude? That is absolutely not true. Stop pulling facts out of your butt. Yeah sure, make light of the fact that now 1. Male r@pe by men (which was recognized up until now as a criminal offence) is no longer a crime and male r@pe by women was never a crime. 2. Women can screw over honest men by misusing this section pretty easily. I hope someone close to you doesn't get entangled in this sh*t. How the f#ck did you just make it all about women huh? This isn't about y'all! I do agree with your main point that one should be allowed to change their mind while in a relationship. However, I would like to point out that while 'right not to be manipulated' may not be a _fundamental right_ the erstwhile Indian Penal Code and Contract law protected against fraud and false promises in cases of agreements. This new rape section (and earlier judicial precedents) were based on this. Time to become Indian passport bro This countries parliament is joke...they can't even think critically... how their decisions gonna impact others..fucki...idiots Not all roses for you either dude. Male on male SA has now also been decriminalized. Ahh yes the new population control bill. Ek kam karo aise mat maro pura Zinda hi choro mat na What if women make a fake promise? I would agree with you if the law applied across genders. Unfortunately it doesn't. So even if the woman breaks up with a man, she can file a case under the section. It all depends on the woman and how evil is she willing to be to extract money from her ex. The point is, WHERE IS THE PROOF? WHAT IS THE PROOF? Did you not read the post? Any woman can say that after having sex with the guy, he promised ti marry me. It would be a he said, she said situation. 1- Men have been making light of rape and were busy abusing feminists when their rights were being stripped. You fought so much when SC tried to criminalise marital rape for the right to rape your wives, why not a peep for months when they were removing the protection of male on male rape? Too busy abusing women instead? 2- Fake cases already exist and happen and can screw over honest men. But are far less in number, almost negligible in number compared to the actual number of rapes (and many in india go unreported). I would also say hopefully women close to you don't get SA or harassed by men, but unfortunately, EVERY woman faced that shit already. I didn't make light of the situation. I am actually the one who pointed out everytime that your protection is being stripped away. Your gender chose to abuse feminists despite feminists also opposing removing 377 that criminalised male on male rape. You hate women that much ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's sarcasm right? No no Men really should go their own way. Then women would be safer. And so would men. üôÑ Section 69 nice Then that's the mother's problems, not the father's. He didn't spread his legs for another woman and made her pregnant with an illegitimate child, the mother did. There is literally no law for protecting men from paternity fraud in our country either. F**k women like these and why are you justifying it? Like i agree men should step up and protest against these laws. But not getting into relationship isn't gonna solve this. When there's a criminal outside your house you don't just lock your door and sit. You call the police and demand justice. Who TF told you I was against criminalizing marital rape? You don't know jackshit about me lady. Stop assuming all men support rape and are rapists and stop acting like false cases don't ruin a man's life. And 1. I have never f*cking made light of a r@pe case, NEVER F#CKING EVER. I would never do that. Rapists disgust me and if they are actually rapists then I am in support of cutting off their d#cks and throwing them in jail for the rest of their lives. My brother was one of the protesters who got sprayed with ice cold water in December 2012 outside of the SC. 2. I know that. But the problem is that the judicial machinery incentivizes women to file false cases when laws and sections like these prop up all the time. >I would also say hopefully women close to you don't get SA or harassed by men, but unfortunately, EVERY woman faced that shit already. Again, you no absolutely nothing about me, girl. A random autowala would flash his sack in front of my best friend in the morning right outside of our college. Guess what happened? The boys of our class beat him up the first time we spotted him. Unfortunately he got away and my friend didn't file a case, and I understood that unfortunately her parents would have taken it out on her. As for other women in my family, I know my mom did when she was young. And whenever that comes to mind my blood boils. Don't assume to speak for the male gender, you don't know jack shit about us. I have had explosive arguments with my relatives when they comment shit about my younger sister and her attitude of talking to boys in her class. Though thankfully most relatives and parents are very open minded in my family. >Your gender chose to abuse feminists despite feminists also opposing removing 377 that criminalised male on male rape. You hate women that much ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You're generalizing again. I am against the 377 being totally removed, much more than you guys because it affects close friends to me who are queer. And no, I absolutely don't hate women. I hate the bigots and hypocrites who will characterize all men into one category, and then mark any man who disagrees with their opinion into a misogynist and I hate the feminists who actually went out to protest that the Parliament once considered adding gender neutral language to these laws. I have nothing against women again, I just hate women who make it all about themselves. Much like the incels who cry about \"But men get SAed too!\" on a post about female rape. You're not much better than them. And when the criminal was inside the house? Men don't care about their own rights, they want to abuse women more. Men got riled up and protested criminalising marital rape but we're too busy abusing feminists when 377 was fully struck down and removed the protection men had from other men. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Men wanted to go their own way and not marry women or get into relationships when told they can't rape their wives. Why not do that now instead? üôÑü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'll tell you how I'm better than them. However worse a woman gets, men are far far far worse. As a queer woman, I know how 377 affects queer men more than you. And I would care for men after they've proven to not be abusive towards women - the men on reddit don't fall into that category. Your friends beat up the autowala? Great. He'd target that woman later when you and your friends aren't around to help her. Men take such revenge. More than beating up the guy, it's essential to ensure your friend is ok and they're safe the subsequent weeks - I say this in hope of actually making a point and not attacking you. I made a point that men literally lost their shit when marital rape was criminalised and sat back cooly when their own protection was stripped. It does show statistically men hate women more than their own fucking human rights here. üôÑ While I agree that it directly targets men and impacts y'all much more, the commenter does make a good point about how this impacts all of us. We should all be worried. This is not the \"win\" for women that many people densely claim it is. The people who make such stupid laws are the ones who \"make it all about women\" while completely ignoring/trying to gloss over how dangerous these laws are for all of us. Another law for women to destroy a man's life Exactly... I totally support your point. I understand that it infantilises women, but then the 'rape on the pretext of marriage' law has always existed back from the British times. And while I agree, socially this sets women back, but there are literally no legal consequences involved here for you guys. Whereas a guy will just go to jail on the whim of his girlfriend 's wishes. This law is pathetic. Not just judicial but political reform too It ultimately shows how deeply even the (supposedly) most \"pro-women\" laws are entrenched in the patriarchal constructs of sex and consent. Men and women desire and enjoy sex and consent is a two-way street!!! When will this stupid world catch up??? I can sense more murders lol The best way to control population is to increase education levels among the poor, and give increased financial independence to women. I don't know what you have in mind. The law is not supposed to do that. Thats a personal thing and absolutely should not be involved with the law. The criminal law is there to protect people against physical/economic harm or prosecution. However heartbreak and all that should be kept neutrally seperate from the law. >More than beating up the guy, it's essential to ensure your friend is ok and they're safe the subsequent weeks Considering I started picking and dropping her from her home every day from that day forth until she felt safe, I think that much was covered. Me and my friends (both girls and boys) also talked a lot to her so that she never felt alone or afraid. I understand where you're coming from in this regard, but to me my friend matters a lot more than a random creep. That creep was never seen outside our college too, at least not for the year or so we were there after the incident. I obviously am not gonna tell you every single detail about whatever happened, you're just a stranger on the internet. >However worse a woman gets, men are far far far worse. Hard disagree. If you think women are angels all the time, take a good Hard look at yourself. Are there not female killers? Are their not women who kill their husband's for their affair partners? I've seen women who killed their own child too. I've seen women who've massacred their own family including their own parents for their lover. Assholes exist across genders. Unfortunately in our country, that number is skewed heavily towards men. That I do agree with. I read about female serial killers and most women in that comments section were sympathetic to her. Heck, they were even sympathetic to Dahmer and Bundy. I guess because most of their victims were men. That should not mean however that you will label all men as misogynistic who disagree with your opinion. You are just undermining the weight of the word, nothing else. As for the men who are against criminalizing marital rape, well that's just scum. And scum should go to the trash, not to your head. Yep just look at Prajwal Ravanna Case, Media has forgotten and now that fucker will probably walk scott free. I guess you can label me with the same brush, because while I wouldn't endorse murdering family for your bf or wtv. I sure af would consider it self defence when women did it when the families were forcibly marrying women off Indian women suffer immensely due to AM and are societally brainwashed and shamed into it. If you're talking to women genuinely, you would have noticed this as well. The level of force associated with marriage in a country where marital rape is not a crime, contested divorce is a thing and no fault divorces don't happen is extreme. Obviously women criminals exist, as you pointed out - they're far far far less in number compared to men (in india atleast). There are bad people everywhere..but here's the thing - majority of women criminals are not rooted in sexism or gender bias. Men still harm women a lot more. Gang rapes, acid attacks, stalking and harassment - never taking no for an answer is far more common. There's a reason men aren't as scared as women to walk down an empty road after dark in india. There's idiots who hero worship criminals everywhere as well. Dahmer and Bundy got their due in court and convicted. You know who was released? Brock turner - a rapist. Heck, gujrat HC released the men who harmed bilkis bano and her family and it took two lawyers to fight tooth and nail to put them back in jail. Manu Sharma - who killed Jessica lal for refusing to serve him a drink was released from jail and given a BJP ticket (that news went into obscurity after that). It took almost a fucking decade to get Nirbhaya justice and one of them was not only let off the hook, he was literally given a tailor shop to set up in Delhi while his identity is protected. Imagine someone who did THAT touching you measuring your body and touching you. (Yes I understand the legal loophole there but still doesn't change the facts). The guy who was serially raping women from Bastian also faced no consequences. You don't know ME either. I went and stood as witness and faced shit to help a friend who was falsely accused of rape by his ex gf. If something is wrong, I would stand for it. But if it's supporting men after the collective behaviour of Indian men? No way. ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§è‡§ï ‡§¨‡§æ‡§®‡§ó‡•Ä: ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§®‡•á ‡§∂‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§®‡•å‡§ï‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§Ø‡•å‡§® ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¨‡§Ç‡§ß ‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§è ‡§§‡•ã 10 ‡§∏‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡•á‡§≤ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§≤‡§ó‡•á‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§ï‡§π‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á, ‡§á‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ó‡§≤‡§§ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à? ‡§¶‡§∞‡§Ö‡§∏‡§≤, ‡§Ø‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§π‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ó‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§á‡§∂ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§§‡§¨ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§ù ‡§Ü‡§è‡§ó‡§æ, ‡§ú‡§¨ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§ê‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ù‡§Æ‡•á‡§≤‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§´‡§Ç‡§∏‡•á ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§´‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è‡•§ ‡§∏‡§π‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§∏‡§π‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ö ‡§™‡•Å‡§≤‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¶‡•Ä‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ñ‡§°‡§º‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§™‡•Å‡§≤‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§®‡•Ç‡§®‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡•§ Laws like this make me less open to marry a non-virgin woman. Funny thing is that I don't even know why. This section manifests with all chauvinism the ideals of protectionism on which misogyny feeds. On the one hand, chastity of women is endorsed as a virtue legally. Therefore, it is ‚Äúin her (chastity's) interest‚Äù that the otherwise consensual sexual intercourse transforms to the offence of rape when there is no resultant marriage, and the promise to marry is proved to have been made without any intention of fulfilling the same. Several patriarchal norms are woven into the provision. Her consent for sexual intercourse when dependent on his promise to marry her, is subtly justified, and her chastity safeguarded. Therefore, when the promise was fake and sexual intercourse happens, it becomes an offence Source - Live law. I completely agree with this. If someone files a case on these grounds and questions the constitutionality of this section, the Supreme court might strike it down. Its not every BS the parliament makes is accepted in the country without opposition now im actually scared of indian women unironically,this is no longer a parasocial joke >There's a reason men aren't as scared as women to walk down an empty road after dark in india. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I don't like walking in the dark at night alone either. This country isn't safe for anybody, and obviously the women are the far greater demographic of victims, but men can get stabbed and robbed too. Of course again SA is generally not a problem we have to worry about, I agree with you there. >You don't know ME either. I went and stood as witness and faced shit to help a friend who was falsely accused of rape by his ex gf. If something is wrong, I would stand for it. Well good for you then. Sorry for judging you, I guess? But your comment came off as insensitive and hence I replied. I was a bit angry. >Indian women suffer immensely due to AM and are societally brainwashed and shamed into it. If you're talking to women genuinely, you would have noticed this as well. I mean a lot of my college classmates who got married off immediately blocked all the male classmate's numbers they had and cut all contact with their male friends. I guess they might have been forced to do so, which is sad. But my point was that I wasn't able to talk to many people after their AM as they blocked me and my friends collectively, and my closest female friends are all unmarried or have boyfriends. >There's idiots who hero worship criminals everywhere as well. True. I agree. >Dahmer and Bundy got their due in court and convicted. You know who was released? Brock turner - a rapist. Heck, gujrat HC released the men who harmed bilkis bano and her family and it took two lawyers to fight tooth and nail to put them back in jail.

Imagine someone who did THAT touching you measuring your body and touching you. (Yes I understand the legal loophole there but still doesn't change the facts). The guy who was serially raping women from Bastian also faced no consequences. Agree with you on all accounts. Sometimes I feel like becoming a vigilante and hunting these freaks down. You have no idea how angry I get every time I read such news. For every one step this country takes forward it also takes 2 backwards when it comes to stuff like this. Even in the college I'm currently working at has an issue with girls leaving their hostels after 9 PM at night for safety reasons. No such restrictions for the boy students. I believe they should instead increase campus security and allow women their freedom, these are adult women, often 25+ in age. Imagine gatekeeping them. I never said this country needs severe reform in laws for women and the way that they are executed. I just think that innocent men should also get a fair voice in the judiciary when it comes to matters like these posts, which they often don't. As for the actual rapists, I again say that I am in support of mutilating them and leaving them for dead. I think we are on the same side here. Just misinterpreted the comments you made. Apologies. yeah that's true but either way it's long process and none of our leaders are even interested on that topic. It's like Noone wants to touch that topic. I'll tell you a case since u said education a relative of mine has made a school in his village specifically for poor people who can't afford. But those same poor people won't send their kids to school and prefer that the kids to pick garbage or beg on streets.So maybe a law like kids under 18 should go to school compulsory no matter the financial condition This law has just killed courtship and marriage in one shot Men wanted to go their own way and not marry women or get into relationships when told they can't rape their wives. I don't know what men you are talking about. Certainly most of the men on reddit wouldn't justify this. Men got riled up and protested criminalising marital rape but we're too busy abusing feminists when 377 was fully struck down. This again I don't know any men in my surrounding upset about marital rape. Just because certain men support this ideas doesn't make the entire male population culprit. Don't reduce a significant amount of men who created enough shitshow to have SC quash it to \"not all men\" >This new rape section (and earlier judicial precedents) were based on this. Exactly my point, call it what it is. It is a fraud at best. Calling it rape is a disservice to rape victims everywhere and makes a joke out of the concept of consent. And also fraud is gender neutral, should be applicable to women who change their minds about marriage afterwards. The Indian law and judiciary is a joke. Don't get into such relationships in the first place. Stop thinking with your dick 87% of the time. I like this, but let's have it both ways. Wow bro, dint know we had nazi in house ? Did you bring your whip along side ? And I'm a lesbian from now on. Also laws like these are very well intended moves to divide and rule, policymakers who happen to be men are making these laws that screw up men because they know they're exempt from such laws due to their positions of power and with the use of media and other echo chambers they manage to convince men that feminism and women are to be blamed and not the policymakers and since false rape cases are easier to prove than actual ones it only adds fuel to the fire that is these already agitated men who go on blaming feminism. Thus achieving both goals at once all while keeping the freedom and rights of women at the minimum possible. It's almost genius if it weren't so evil. No country for men >I mean a lot of my college classmates who got married off immediately blocked all the male classmate's numbers they had and cut all contact with their male friends. I guess they might have been forced to do so, which is sad. But my point was that I wasn't able to talk to many people after their AM as they blocked me and my friends collectively, and my closest female friends are all unmarried or have boyfriends. This is the point though. A lot of cases it's subtle but very regressive manipulation and thinking. AM is one of the biggest societal evil - a casteist and misogynistic practice that noone seems to oppose properly - not even women. It's honestly astounding and shocking how many women defend the practice and often join in shaming women who choose to not marry or are childfree. It's not about 25+ it's everywhere. √Ät my office, during night shift timings, women aren't allowed to leave on their own. It's mandatory to take office cab - or have a registered family member/husband pick you up. And, this ends up excluding allowing bfs to pick up or women able to go alone (unless they have own vehicle). Yes it's good womens safety is taken seriously but honestly, the necessity of this is nuts. Esp cause office cab cuts from our salary, opting out and taking auto instead would save us money and cost about 2k less, which means men get to save 24k a year just cause they're men. Campus security doesn't help much when women want to step off campus. During my college days, at campus hostel, women literally had a 6pm deadline (and classes end at 5) so except weekends they can't do jackshit. Boys hostel had NO deadlines. Even living off campus, I had a 9pm deadline unless a family member came and picked me up and informed the hostel. There was an uproar a few years ago too, when the govt tried to show women empowerment by making bangles and sindoor tax free, while sanitary products are expensive af. What's worse is that capitalist exploitation has not just increased price of these products, but reduced the size and quality, which led to mishaps and miscalculation (including me) and wasting money and trips to gynaecs and stress thinking our flow was affected or increased and worrying about our health. When all the time it was capitalist exploitation. And there's NO regulations in place. I always thought women would disappear once they got married and they don't care for friends anymore. I always felt that when I was a teen and younger. But afterwards I came to realise it's only women who went into AM that vanished. Women who married their bfs, may have reduced contact a bit and not as free (esp after having kids) but they still make time, come to meet and hang out and spend time and call. It's ones who entered AM that seem to vanish completely. I am all for gender equal laws in general. But with how the society and crime is skewed in india, I can never stand for gender neutral laws here until the society is more egalitarian. I understand your anger. But I was trying to make a point that men literally hate women so much in india, that they wasted their energy opposing laws that protect women instead of fighting for laws that literally protect men and trans men. talk about cock blocking Or why not teach girls to simply not have sex without marriage and also to boys to not have sex without marriage. And bring back corporal punishment to those who are caught doing so by 4 witnesses. Agreed I literally said in my comment that the latter (how it affects men) is the bigger problem. Contextualising the law does not take away from that. Pointing out that it reinforces certain concepts does not take away from that either. I especially did not claim that women are the only or the major or the original victims of this law. Let's just hope it is vice versa too . What else do you expect from this pathetic government?? That‚Äôs actually what the govt is doing but unfortunately this is being missed you as a way to breed more! This is gonna fk some innocent but hrny mens lives ü§£ü§£ Why is it assumed in our country that only men have sexual urges and should be punished for that. What if consent is there? ye RSS wali soch hai RSS ke schools bhi girls ke alag boys ke alag hote hai wahi rule india mein karne ki koshish ki jaa rahi..........agar seedha seedha boys girls aalag alag wala rule laaye to bawaal hoga ......isiliye ye laaye hai 69 .......kal aage neeyam aaye ki shaadi se pehle sex karna Rape hai ......chahe wo engaged hi kyu na ho ... aur politicians kitna bhi sex karle promotion ka wada karke unhe koi nai rokega ......this is all Rss wali soch ......at this point ....I am starting hate bjp and RSS ......mere papa bhi isi soch ke hai ki ladko ladkiyon ko alag rehna chahiye RSS acchi hai desh ke liye ......fuxking hell dating culture on purpose hai RSS apni soch ab power mein aake pore desh mein lagana chahti hai aur main media iss pe baat nahi karegi ......kyunki unhe to dekhna hai ki rahul gandhi ne hindu ko hinsawadi kyu keh diya Bold of you to assume BJP fanboys have any interaction with the opposite sex consensually So banning pre-marital sex? You all overestimate women's education wrt the law Has this ever actually happened to you? \"sTaY sAfE\" Many men see any law that cd take many men who commit crimes like this, to task as \"misandric\" Misandric is a made up word btw. The correct word is misandrist. Pay a certain amount of taxes to have the right to have kids. The more you pay, the more children you can have. Except society isn't gender neutral dear, so some laws have to be made to compensate for the heavy hand of societal bias, for actual justice. Also how many men you know have been served this law and are inconvenienced by this? Maybe there is a law but how is it used and is it being misused? All these things matter before you get this paranoid. THAT should be changed. Exactly Exactly. This is the real \"misandrist\" issue right here, there is no other realistically dangerous misandrist law to men. Being gay is not a choice, and it's not a fad for you to pick up as and when you please. Lawmakers üíÄ What is with these comments about choosing to be gay? I'd rather be gay than be with men but it's not a choice to be a lesbian. Being gay is not a choice and it isn't a funny joke either. Mera Bharat mahan Not everyone is emotionally intelligent enough to be completely rational about personal matters. Also people don't show their true selves at the start of any relationship Someone consenting under coercion isn't regarded as full consent. If your job or livelihood is on the line, you're not in a position to consent properly. I get that sometimes the prospective employee themselves offer sexual favours in exchange for employment or promotions, but the power imbalance means that the onus is on the employer to rebuff them. This also ensures people don't get promotions or jobs unfairly. Basically, it's as much preventive (employers taking a huge risk by approaching or allowing such approaches) as it is punitive. App Idea üí° Pre-Coitus Consent- For both the parties. Read this Law and say that both of them are engaging in doing this deed out free will and no promises were made. Nope I had seen a sci-fi movie / show, where both of them speak into a device about consent. It's high time we make it a reality! It‚Äôs gay propaganda 101. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Also, Govt is low-key pushing people to be gay to decrease population. Very cunning. In real life, a good number of the people in corporate sector who are BJP supporters are in relationships. Who is even making these laws? Op reply please Not just political but the countrys mindset also has to be changed. This politics is just a reflection of that mindset. So what this section is essentially saying is, Women are juvenile children with low/stunted cognition who need to be saved (because they can't make decisions for themselves, duh) even if they are objectively adults & themselves CLAIM to be mature, responsible & free-thinking humans. Okay, got it. Wow congrats for the most deranged response I've ever rec'd on reddit Why so sour! If you don‚Äôt want to be gay - don‚Äôt! Consent is only banned in marital relationships here What is virginity? Any definition? How to prove virginity? To be honest I believe the concept of love is love once two people decide they love each other they should be punished by 20years jail if they break up. Sex no nex it do not matter, finances and time have equal values too you know. /s And the Section has the number 69 You are projecting your shitty circle and their activities on all of men then, shameful And adultery is legal? Our country is so extreme in this. In rural areas, girls can't leave houses, and rich women in urbans can just fuck up some random men's life. It's call being realistic ya idiot. You're saying that as if us men can't live without sex smh Section 69' How about population control inside jail?? This was already in IPC, wasn‚Äôt it? At this point whole Indian mens are facing a womanized nation and laws and it's too late. No one speaks about this matter.. From now request your government to delete \"Men and woman are equal\" from syllabus. Desh ka kanoon banane ka thekka bajrangdal ke neta ko diya hein kya ? What kind of logic is this? \"Having sex is only okay if you marry them after it\"?? The government has no business in people's bedrooms. What else can we expect from our country where the court decides a rapist has to marry his victim for the victim's \"justice\". Is there any way to revert section BNS69 , Is there a chance if we all collectively sign a petition to remove it . Genius masturbatory stroking by ModiXi We don't need a law, we need \\*\\*\\*\\*ing mandatory sex education and affordable contraceptives for the lower and middle classes. How much is your relative charging as school fees? Can those poor people afford to pay any fees at all? Are they even eating? Do they have a roof over their heads? You have no concept of poor. But you love looking down on them. Women are more likely to vote based on identity politics that's why politicians don't give a shit about men's rights they can essentially win most women votes at expense of few men's votes by making biased laws. In case of marrige and personal laws majority of the world is extremely gynocentic anyways. in 2013 woman protested against gender neutral law so better woman donot give advice why laws are not gender neutral false case is bigger issue woman protested against gender neutral law in 2013 you can search That's just an exception, why would women give up the privileged laws they have She said He said basis? No, only She said basis. Yes you are correct, once a guy gets into a relationship, he is at the mercy of his girlfriend totally. That sounds like an Indian population conduct problem, with lots of lying. You're right, I don't know how it'll get used but to me the idea is not bad. No he isn't charging anything it's like yk a normal village school and yeah I'm pretty sure they have mid day meals And yes there is a solid building. There are kids coming from other villages as well to learn there but the local ones who collect garbage and stuff to resell it don't send their kids to the school. And no I am not looking down on them it's just the truth you try to help them out but they are the ones who don't want to be helped True recently learned about that govt provides cheaper medical products the generic ones. Which are 10x cheaper not sure if there are the ones about which we are thinking I want to know specifically what happens when female employees itself offers consent to get promotions unfairly. How it will be then a problem for employer? Once they get what they needed, they can easily blackmail under these new laws, or even go public as they got assaulted. isse muze kya lena dena? mera toh koi partner hi nahi hai üôÇ Wow! Nailed it! Some of them, yeah, but they usually date fake religious women anyways. You know, the ones who are conservative, but only when it benefits them. A similar law existed in the IPC too. The SC managed to weaken that previous law years ago. Word is, judges have been trying to get rid of this law for years now, they're just waiting for enough public support, like when homosexuality and adultery was decriminalized. Actually for the first time, a lot of people are talking about it. Including respected feminists and judges and lawyers. The momentum must be maintained if we want this law to be removed, or at least watered down. No, because women always fight for their freedom, including religious women. Men on the other hand cling on to tradition and religion and never fight for their freedom. Doesn't matter if the man wins the case even, the process itself is punishment. The man will still have to go to court for years and pay for lawyers, not be able to go abroad etc So if I give her employment, I can have sex with her?? It's already there. Supreme court interpreted that false promise of marriage will lead to consent getting nullified and it will be considered rape. BNS just made it an official law with clear punishment. By their own logic, women should have stopped interacting with men long ago they way women have been subjugated by society and men for centuries in this country. Rapists still get away, even olympic medal winning medalist don't get justice and these people are scared of so called laws which have a history and pattern of hardly being enforced correctly. All these laws are made by men yet they find a way to abuse and humiliate Indian women over it. They definitely should. I have heard n number of stories around me where men get into a relationship for years, have fun, enjoy the companionship and then after wasting years of the girl they remember ki mommy/abba nahi maanege due to caste difference. Imagine being so spineless despite being a raja beta that your parents won't dare to disown you. It's not spineless behavior but deliberate deceit. I am hoping only such men get fucked by this law. I wish the law was only for men who get into a relationship and after wasting years and years of a girl's life remember that mummy/abba nahi maanege because of caste difference. I have heard n number of stories around me where men get into a relationship for years, have fun, enjoy the companionship and then after wasting years of the girl they remember ki mommy/abba nahi maanege due to caste difference. Imagine being so spineless despite being a raja beta that your parents won't dare to disown you and you still give this parents excuse. It's not spineless behavior but deliberate deceit. I am hoping only such men get fucked by this law. The Karnataka state government wanted to implement gender neutral laws on this and a feminist organization is already against it saying it weakens the law for women. Like dude, bringing a neutrality by including men could be raped too makes it weaker? How? Onexindia went nuts not understanding how this happens. The reason why that law aptly named Section 69 because the law fucks you‚Ä¶ Lmao Being gay is not a choice lol but you know absolutely nothing about queer people If they make laws all about women then why are you using \"misogynist\" keyword here? If it's all about women and nothing about men, shouldn't it be misandrist? Literally, just using a buzz word to make the crowd feel that \"kuch kaand ho gya hai\" won't work. Please use proper wordings as words have meanings instead of dropping a women-centric word-salad. If I did this same on r/TwoXChromosomes, I'd be butchered Someone's going to come up with declaration and consent form to be signed - every time before, during and at the end of relationships I'll tell you my own story. We got married last December after being in a relationship for 10 years. I am from a lower caste, she is from a higher caste. Her parents were against it for a few years but then they were okay, this wasn't a problem. But a guy(our classmate in primary school) wanted to marry her and did a similar thing as you mentioned. He went from house to house in their community and distributed a 'love-jehad' type letter. I never got contacted by anyone since I lived in a different city but many people 'visited' her parents and some visited my parents. She and her family stayed strong and did not give in to the social pressure so this dude could not involve law enforcement, fortunately, but this all lasted for a year and she and her family were harassed many times. Even when we went to a temple(temple in my small town where many people get married) to arrange my marriage, they said go get married and registered on legal papers first so that there wouldn't be any ruckus made by 'some people' from her side. Rather than going to jail for 10 years for a breakup I would rather unalive the randi and go to jail for 20 years How do you know which one is the crazy one , what he said is the best response, follow brahmacharya if you want to live in india otherwise leave This will not teach women a lesson but this will indeed save you from serving time in prison, follow brahmacharya or its ownüíö same and benefits , not to teach anyone anything , whatever happens to women is none of our concern indians are not the best at anything no point in breeding anymore What is our best strategy right now ? Not do anything that makes you vulnerable to these laws like getting married...... and then attempt to leave the country"
