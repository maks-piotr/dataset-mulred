And also I need to connect Mumbai and London by road. Just one more turn then.",
        "Playing Borderlands 2. I havenâ€™t had this much fun in a long ass time. I find rpgs to be slow but this one does it well. Killing enemies is always fun",

        "Was playing Red dead redemption 2. Really lovely game. Now playing assassin's creed valhalla. Initial gameplay seems nice. I didnt liked the recent titles in the AC series like origin and odyssy. Heard about valhalla a lot, so gave it a try",
        "I have finally started enjoying AC Unity, after going through movement guides on youtube. Parkour is still clunky, cover feature is quite bad but roaming through revolutionary France is becoming fun now.",

        "Yep I did. It took a while. But I'd say it worth every minute of gameplay",
        "Origin Odyssy and Valhalla, these are interconnected. From what I heard. Similar gameplay, parkour and combat. \nSo I chose valhalla to play, just to explore vikings and norse mythology more.",
        "Got into EFT a couple of days ago (level 5 rn), having a lot of fun. Just learnt woods, will be learning reserve and/or interchange next. I know I joined pretty late-ish wipe but next wipe it'll be an even better experience.",
