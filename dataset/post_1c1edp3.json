    "light_cleaned_comments": "Is it because of RSS against conversion or are they pulling the strings? This act should have been declared Illegal... How.is that even possible. Way to confront Buddhism Jihad /S Pretty sure this is unconstitutional, against Right to freedom of religion which is a fundamental right. Does the government not know the law themselves? Thank you Modi! Freedom of religion and religious expression less of a reality these days Buddhist are aunty nasunal invaders One by one sari minorities ka time ayega ! Shariah for Gujrat Oi! Converting to Buddhism eh mate? Got loicense for that? Next in line to bear the brunt of Hindutva propaganda. Buddhists beware. in UP, you need to put your name, age and address in the newspaper to ensure there are \"no objections\" to your conversion this is still better These state governments are such shitholes man. Why the fuck does the government care about my religion? What's next? They're gonna put brain implants to know which God I worship and see if it matches my certificate? Fucking idiots Post this is chaddi speaks and they'll start calling this Buddhism jihad. Or they'll do a ton of mental gymnastics to imply the same thing. George Orwell would have loved the fact that the law enabling this is called the **Freedom** of Religion Act. Gujarat is literally Florida when it comes to passing conservative laws Wait till they find out Buddhism IS Hinduism. you see, this makes certain hindus, who in their grand delusions think they are in danger because muslim men hungrily lust after their daughters, feel more secure the rights of man and citizen pale in comparison And what if you dont? Do religious establishments ask an affidavit for your religious allegiance? As long as you respect a relegion and dress according to customs, how does someone else even know what religion your are? Secure about what? That the lafandars that lust are from the same religion? Guys guys guys.....you don't get it. It's the love Jihad. We have to make sure they're not being love jihaded. Yes....This is completely Fucked up... Fraud happens , practising buddhism but on paper they are Hindus. Census fraud,should we support this? Freedom of religion yaa expression jaise shabdo ka hawala tb dete jb government conversion pr jail krti ya harass krti. Even if you follow a religious custom in your own life, personal law that affects you will be based on the religion that‚Äôs on your official identity. So even if you decide you are becoming Buddhist or Rastafarian or whatever, if you‚Äôre say a Muslim officially, Muslim personal law will be applied. Same goes for Hindu personal law. It is not part of Hinduism. They share some common beliefs, but no. It's not a part. So the way to tackle census fraud is...don't let them convert? Better headline: \"Gujarat govt seeks to prevent Dalits from escaping Hinduism\" It‚Äôs not a part of Hinduism. That‚Äôs the entire point of the ruling, read the article. Earlier, they were not letting Dalits convert officially to Buddhism because they said ‚ÄúiTS jUSt a BrANcH Of HIndUiSM VrrOo‚Äù. Now they officially recognised it as a separate religion, but you still need the courts permission if you dare to convert in Gujarat. Some random asshole ( \\*cough\\* Bajrang Dal \\*cough\\* literally any other orthodox religious group for that matter \\*cough\\* ) files a police case against you, mostly in cases of interfaith marriage At best you suffer legal harassment, at worst 5-10 yrs jail Yeah. But they did this after they took an L. Earlier they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúgive permission‚Äù to Dalits to convert to Buddhism because apparently ‚ÄúBuddhism is just another sect of avar santan kulcha‚Äù. But now they officially ruled that it‚Äôs a separate religion, yet they have to gain the courts permission to convert. Bruh, Am not saying that. and that is the problem. Anyone with enough clout can register a case against anyone, and legal harassment would happen. Religion doesn't even need to be involved. general problem with Indian legal system, especially true for retarded laws like this You are right these things can happen and do happen, but to what extent does the state needs to involved in your personal choice of religion? i do not claim to know the machinations of the delusional mind Without the gators and the booze and not to mention spring break beach goers. Do they have their ‚Äúflorida man‚Äù yet btw? Bhakts be like: Religion is personal. Politics is personal. Hence religion = politics lmao It's to control dalits. Most Buddhism converts are dalits Dvaita Bhaashan Then? I can practice hinduism today , Jainism tomorrow, Buddhism after that, now who tf authorised gov to poke in it? Why are DMs getting involved in religious conversions? Can they reject someone's wish to convert? How can you generalize this as fraud? In rural areas you get prosecuted for not following hinduism especially scs/sts so obviously they are forced to practice in secret? Do you go to a naxalite area in central India and start yelling that you're a right wing capitalist? If they don't want Dalits to convert then maybe they should tackle casteism instead of making stupid laws. Nobody should be forced to follow something where they are not accepted as equals. BJP is too focused on religious politics to even think about development First they came for the socialists ... Gujarat is one step ahead in reaching dictatorship The state has always cared about your religion. It was divided due to it. It gives subsidies in case you belonged to a particular religion. It taxes the proceeds and offerings received by the places of worship of a certain religion. Hmmm. TIL was taught Buddhism as a branch of Hinduism in school. Gross generalization. I wonder why the sub allows such kind of offensive dialogue on hindus. Ah okay. Because Siddhartha being an avatar of Vishnu, I made the connection of Buddhism as a branch of Hinduism like Jains or Sikhs during the wars. Oh well, TIL. not a generalization, I said certain Hindus, not all To assuage your ruffled feathers, I'll note that orthodox fanatics of all religions will happily abuse such laws to restrict interfaith marriage I talked about Hindus, because that's the community Yogi was pandering to when he brought in this law to \"curb love jihad\", and is the majority community there If Punjab, Kashmir or Nagaland pass similar laws, the same statement will apply there with the relevant majority religion swapped, I have no special quarrel with Hindus Way to show your ignorance/WhatsApp knowledge üôÇ. Both Buddhism and Jainism grew in opposition to the evils of vedic culture. They explicitly reject the Vedas. What we call Hinduism today didn't even exist then. It took shape several hundred years later. Why tf do we need their approval? It‚Äôs their wish to pray whoever they want, who r these mfrs? If they don‚Äôt give permission then? As if it can stop them from changing their beliefs. Pretty sure he‚Äôs going to bring this to all religions in future Gujaratis are crazy wow. I can‚Äôt imagine the haalat of their own children in the house. Dalits buddhists should vote for congress But‚Ä¶ sangis told me those are sects of Hinduism. /s You will know that you are as big of repressors as mughals . Just that you got the power late. üòÇ Personal law should have no precedence over civic/constitutional law in India. How the fuck is this even constitutional? it probably isn't, but will take a while before a case reaches the court system for example, Article 370 was a national topic, still took 4 years for hearings to start and 6 months afterwards for judgement to be declared States have the power to enforce such laws. It's alright man. No issues. Ah okay. Nah not WhatsApp just whatever I learnt back in school. Been out of touch. No issues. TIL. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Aka I want my disposable slaves Lmfao. U don't understand, development happens when you have cheap disposable slaves. How else will our glorious leaders maintain their power trip How can this be called freedom of religion act ? So 8f permission is not given ,one can't convert? Nah. Building temples is easier than to upset oppressive social structures. Especially when that system is also a core of our support Last year a whole village converted to Buddhism, making it the first village in India and Gujarat without a single dalit Hindu. Looks like saffron pigs are scared of Dalits leaving their disgusting drama. Further reading: Lol. Buddha being an avatar happened much later in Indian history. But sure, keep on believing that. What is the incentive for people to commit this fraud? Who the fuck cares about religion on census? People are whatever religion they say they are. If Hindus are converting, it's because they prefer a religion more than Hinduism. They are 100 % allowed to. Always remember, for saffron pigs Dalits are mere disposable foot soldiers who are asked to fight with poor Muslims on the streets while the Upper caste dogs chill in their 3BHKs and enjoy these riots. Hinduism is majority only because Dalits and tribals are still counted as Hindus. The day they leave this bigoted religion, Hindus will be forced to share their monopoly over political power with other communities. What is bajrang dal for then? They are so strong and smart they should be put to work for the glory of Hanuman As a centre right person, I condemn the move. What rationale could be used to justify something like this? The Buddha being an avatar of Vishnu is a later addition to Hinduism. Buddhists don‚Äôt believe that. Jainism and Sikhism are not branches of Hinduism either. Buddhism and Jainism are heterodox Sramanas that arose in the 5th-3rd Century BCE that explicitly **reject the Vedas**. They reject the Vedas and they were formulated before the writing of many puranas, they are specifically not Hinduism. Sikhism is also not a part of Hinduism, they explicitly reject the Vedas and the Puranas also, and believe in a monotheistic god. It‚Äôs extremely insulting and patronising to the followers of these religions to just say ‚Äúyou are all Hindus Saar‚Äù This is insane But i had heard all are same and part of Indian religions? Dalits who vote for the BJP are the most (sorry for my language here) are the most retarded. they gonna come after them once they deal with muslims >are they pulling the strings? When weren't they? They are pulling it since godse days. I'm telling you this again and again. RSS is the real life Hydra from marvel movies. They spread everywhere. BJP is just a face of it. BJP will die sooner or later. But RSS will continue to live in the shadows. What is the benefit they are getting by this fraud? Buddha is from Nepal. Buddhism is a foreign influence. He also ate beef! /S True If I start believing in Islam, Christianity, Sikhism or Buddhism or anything else, I will simply start following it. Perhaps fo to their religious places. What is this conversion? What prevents me from believing in whatever I want to? I can change my beliefs every day if I so desire. It is not. Gautam hated hinduism so much that he created a new religion. the state of uttar pradesh, gujarat and many others disagree unfortunately Not all of us bro! I'm a gujju and this doesnt go well with me at all! Like constitution ki spirit (religious freedom) ka toh respect hi ni kar rahe ye... thats just modi tho >Fraud happens , practising buddhism but on paper they are Hindus. Just who is getting harmed by this? Why do people care? Piece of shit state, the products of which are destroying the country every minute. ‚ÄúTo assuage your ruffled feathers‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna use that from now on ü™∂ feel free Im proud of you. I hope more younger generation wakeup bro the heck!!!!! btw whatever media tells abt gujarat is it actually true??? i mean ground reality?? yaa man i am tired of telling these things to hindus they should respect distictivness har jiz aajkal hindu ho jati hai You can‚Äôt order non veg in houses owned by gujjus in Mumbai, THE financial capital of the most(?) populous country in the world. And then bhakts say that india becoming a dictatorship is western propaganda. Isn't religion a personal choice under the constitution So the key to immortality is terrible looking half pants? TIL Wait but how does anyone determine my religion 'officially'? I haven't seen my religion written in any of my government documents. Are bhai sabko hi daal lo, Sikhism is a distinct and has equal parts Islam and Hinduism if any Obviously there are some legal provisions and restrictions based on religion in our laws. But how do they expect to enforce conversion prevention as such? It's completely incoherent - do they expect that someone will alter their sincerely held convictions because of legal dictates? I would recommend reading Ambedkar's Annihilation of Caste Just like the newspeak in US, ‚ÄúCitizens united‚Äù is actually Corporations united and ‚ÄúRight to Work‚Äù is in fact Right to Fire. They banned me for asking is yogi government better or worse than the previous governmentüòµ‚Äçüí´. Such a childish rubbish sub Yes, I came here to make the same comment. I have seen children of all central ministers studying and settling well in western countries, while there followers are being brainwashed and fighting in the streets. Always remember, for saffrons the Dalits are mere disposable foot soldiers who are asked to fight with the Muslims on the streets while the Upper caste chill in their 3BHKs and enjoy these riots. If you still don't believe me look at the representation of LC in leadership of RSS or HMS Hinduism is majority only because Dalits and tribals are still counted as Hindus. The day they leave this religion, Hindus will be forced to share their monopoly over political power with other communities. All of you bastards who sit and justify voting for the BJP. I hope you're seeing a sample of what they can do on a national level. License for starting a live-in relationship, license for converting to Buddhism‚Ä¶ Now do we need a license for hanging out as well? Why tf the state cares what faith we belong to? I read it in Tommy Shelby's voice. Article 370 hearing took years because supreme court judges are a bunch of pussies. How has this Act not been declared unconstitutional yet? There's an explicit Article about freedom of religion. Lord Voldemort wasted all that time LMAO Lord Voldemort wasted all that time LMAO I think PK recently said they want more than just your word they want ideological dominance (Prashant kishore) And that's UCC for you Ministry of Love intensifies. Please do not give them ideas. Count obc too What a clown show BJP is the mushroom, RSS is the fungus' mycelium. Hoxreus was a waste RAHHHHHH! Ideally speaking, they want your daughters and sons. Sons for the riot army, daughters to make babies. I mean if this isnt like the taliban, what is? Along the way, they will identify who will get which girl etc. Not too far fetched. So basically I am Captain America and my friend who is voting for BJP is Winter Soldier? Seems right. Wasn't Buddha in fact an avatar of Vishnu? So now you need the District Magistrate's permission to worship some designated avatars of Vishnu and approval not needed for other avtars? What a shit show this country has become. Par saar Sikhs toh hindu hi they /S Ghar ka bada beta is sikh saar. /S \"Gujarat\" where democracy goes to die... > ‚Äú‚ÄùWe‚Äôve observed a lapse in adhering to the prescribed procedure for applications seeking permission for Hinduism to Buddhism conversions. Furthermore, we‚Äôve received feedback from applicants and autonomous bodies suggesting that prior permission is unnecessary for such religious conversions,‚Äù the notification said. **Citizens of Independent India are not seeking permission**, they are just declaring their intent to follow different religion for your records. > The relevant Act was introduced by the government with the aim of curbing religious conversions achieved through methods such as allurement, coercion, misrepresentation, or any other fraudulent means. In an amendment introduced in 2021, the Act was revised to explicitly prohibit forced religious conversions through marriage. Guilty until proved innocent? similar to PMLA/UAPA? If they care so much, then ask them to do the census first and then bark about religion. You want to give subsidies, get the exact proportion of population for whom you are planning that. All these things are secondary. Anti conversion is only for minorities? Can't say about proper Gujarat but in other states where I've lived, they fall in a \"spectrum.\" I know quite a few in my own family who are very chill and open (our grandfathers, grandmothers do come from proper Gujarat so I don't know if that counts), others I know who are very closed off. Same with the few' gujju friends I've had. Well what does this mean if you are atheist or agnostic? And wow, looks like the entire world is having religiously based delusions. I bet the aliens are waiting for us to evolve away from religions. okay cool.....have a good day ahead!!!! But if Dalits leave then where will they pee?"
