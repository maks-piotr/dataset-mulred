The alliance which includes- US, UK, Australia, New Zealand other than Canada- called the accusations serious. The US said it was deeply concerned over Justin Trudeau’s claim about India’s role.",

On the alliance, Australian PM Anthony Albanese said, “I don’t talk about Five Eyes intelligence at a press conference...we don’t speculate on what intelligence is.\"\n\nI have read the WaPo article, every country refused to condemn India during G20 summit.

Trudeau was given his name along with others by the then Punjab CM CaptAmarinder Singh. Interpol had a red notice out for him. You do realise there are intelligence and security agencies constantly tracking and taking action against these sort of things, and they don’t need to advertise everything in NDTV prime time news. \n\nAt the same time, yes, killing a foreign citizen in the manner alleged is wrong. But till now there’s no proof made public or any formal charges brought by police. Trudeaus carefully chosen word mash was drafted carefully to be more jumble and mumble, but essentially he has announced now that they would be investigating, and at the time of announcement it seems they didn’t have any evidence. Only “credible” allegations. So… allegations. \n\nBtw mr Nijjars close friend one Arsh Dalla had a congress politician murdered in Moga, Punjab yesterday, and then posted about it on Facebook claiming responsibility.

I haven’t found any articles from the Canadian side about what he’s classified as and what efforts have been put if any to hunt him. \n\nIf he was assasinated then it might have been a more nuanced conversation, absolutely. \n\nBut he wasn’t the one assasinated. Hardeep Singh was. Some articles say he’s associated with these terrorists. It may very well be true, but I didn’t see any direct links like what they are able to show for Dalla and other similar terrorists. You say Hardeep has a red notice but I don’t see any evidence of it anywhere. I would assume the NYT would mention it in an article named “who is Hardeep”. They do not. They are no being biased I don’t think because they make sure to mention his shady methods of acquiring Canadian citizenship among other facts. \n\nDo you have evidence or articles showing  Hardeep  had an interpol red notice?",

Canada doesn't really have the nationalistic environment that India does, which is why the gains Mr Trudeau could have from this are limited (and are likely worthless in comparison with the repercussions his statement will lead to). People have also compared the Khalistani to Osama, but I believe that the difference is that the person who was assassinated was not a declared terrorist by most nations (which was the case with Osama). It is true that Canada has been soft on Sikh terrorism, but we cannot ignore the reality that the US (which has not been as lenient aside from allowing Sikhs for Justice to exist due to their views on the freedom of speech) has also not said anything that would indicate a position that benefits India.

It allowed us to not only pursue action against those who had funded the attacks from other countries, but became the basis of a massive international isolation of Pakistan which allowed us to maintain pressure on them for years. That had also, for quite a while, allowed us to also enhance our strategic presence in Afghanistan.\n\nThat's the sort of cooperation and engagement we're actively pissing away here. The next time a major attack happens in India, none of these organizations will receive the political authorization to work with India. Not unless the government makes concessions in some areas, or there is explicit and immediate value for another country. India just blew up years worth of goodwill, not just from Canada, but every major country allied with Canada or atleast keen to keep them conciliated. Definitely alliances like the Five Eyes grouping.\n\nAll for a non entity of an activist with the barest influence over problems in Punjab. And because instead of continuing to push after filing for extradition and gathering and providing evidence, they became impatient.

Police said that Baljinder Singh Balli (45), who was also locally known as ‘namberdar’, was shot twice. While one bullet pierced his chest, the other hit his thigh. Balli was the block president of Ajitwal village for the Congress party. Police said that two assailants came on a bike. While one entered the house, the other kept waiting outside.\n\n> Hours after the incident, fugitive gangster Arshdeep Singh Gill alias Arsh Dalla, also a native of Dala village but believed to be hiding in Canada, took to Facebook and claimed responsibility for the killing.

Samra is not the first listed gangster to be killed. Among those listed in 2021 was Meninder Dhaliwal.

Which is why China NOT doing is what makes them an outlier & rarity, esp when Degree/Level/Gradient of the threat is accounted for.",

        "Covert operations happen all the time. We had a really scary terror reign in Punjab from the khalistanis in the late 70s to late 80s. It was worse than Kashmir militancy where in Kashmir was just around a few isolated areas of Kashmir but Khalistani terrorism was violent throughout most of north india to down  as Pune. They managed to assassinate prominent figures including our PM. They bombed a plane with children and babies. GOi is rightfully worried about the newly raising khalistanis and don’t want them to go full throttle like the 80s. Numerous requests to tackle them was rejected by Canada. I don’t blame the RAW at all for doing such an act. They managed to kill four of them in UK, in Pakistan and Canada. Just imagine these mother fuckers in close hands with Pakistan! What did Pakistan did to us? Even recently? I was well aware of the violence during 80s I was a kid but it’s a daily menace. Probably you were not even born!",
        "Uh huh. Carte blanche to kill whoever you want, without trial, without confirmation of guilt. Totally fine.\n\nBut when Pakistan does it, it's terrorism.\n\nProblem is, when you aren't the biggest mofos around and need some aid, to the western countries whose citizens you've been executing, you're not so different anymore.\n\nAnd that's when that self interest you're pounding comes to bite you in the ass.\n\nKeep pounding your chest and thinking this was super smart to start waging asymmetric war against the West. Toss out decades of careful diplomatic policy to execute one dude who was a child when the last bout of violence happened in the 80s. Genius move there.\n\nBut I realize talking about little things like rule of law isn't always worth it in India. This is a country that takes great pride in jailing people on trumped up charges and holding them indefinitely without charges or evidence. Especially minorities. Now they're exporting that shit abroad.\n\nAnd there will be consequences bud. Doesn't matter to me if you're a kid or a boomer. The fact that you don't seem to understand how this shit works tells me enough. Your justifications don't change the fact that what India just did is not very different from the shit Pakistan pulls. In the past the fact that India was different gave it leverage. Leverage it used such as in the aftermath of the Bombay terror attacks.\n\nBut the supreme leader with his masterful understanding of entire political science doesn't need to worry about that right? Everyone's just going to bow down to us because... reasons I guess.",
        "Right! A Pakistani giving moral lessons.! I only read the first two lines! Now piss of to your stupid nation!",
        "Lol, it's cute that you think I'm Pakistani. I do agree my nation has been very stupid though. I've got no desire to piss off to it though since they've made it clear they'll happily jail folks with the wrong opinions, call them terrorists, urban naxals or anti nationals, and now they've escalated to murdering foreign citizens in broad daylight in other countries.\n\nIt's ok though. I understand you didn't want to read too much. Reading is hard. And it's easier to just wallow in baseless nationalistic pride and think you're something special.",
        "Nobody is going to give a fuck about this. This will settle down in a few days. There are much important problems for the world to worry about. India will continue to buy cheap oil from Russia, war planes from France, continue to manufacture for the west, Send tickets to space Yourself and Trudeau can go f*ck themselves and keep sulking living in an utopian world.\n\nAnd your point about keeping in jail indefinitely- yep jihadis like you are kept in prison forever you lot shouldn’t see the light of day. And oh well, that’s  what the west and Europe doing now as well.",
        "Pakistan used to think the same. As did Russia. It's the fallacy of authoritarian idiots to assume that they will always be different. Always protected. Immune from consequences.\n\nIt's odd that you've got such a strong sense of national pride and grievance, that you hold onto disputes and events from half a century ago. But seem to think them dumb westerners have no memory at all and will just forget everything overnight. I'm guessing you think you're super smart while the rest of the world is just filled with idiots eh?\n\nBut it's nice to at least get an open acknowledgement about little things like law don't matter. Best pray you never end up with the government disagreeing with your politics though? Might end up called a jihadi and jailed without a trial too.\n\nBut let me guess. That would never happen to you. Never ever. Totally not. Surely not to an ubermensch.",

        ">I honestly dunno about this. Would we really take such a huge risk to kill someone who wasn’t really a threat to India in anyway?\n\nI was making the same point in another thread. Unless there was an immediate risk to indian lives and no other way of avoiding it, this shouldn't have been done. Also now that this news has leaked this will give more momentum to their fringe movement than anything he could have done.\n\nPeople are comparing it to America assasinating Iranian general, but they seem to forget Iran is an hostile govt for America they dont care about their relations. Canada on the other hand is a friendly nation, assasination a citizen is obviously a very bad step. Even US Saudi's relationship has been frosty since Khashoggi was murdered. \n\nIndians might get a kick out of extra judicial killings like this and quote their favorite Akshay Kumar movies, but rule of law based countries will balk at it. The western nations are wary of anyone who does not follow rule of law, the implications will be distrust in every interaction with Indian govt",

He did it because it was going to come out in press, his own minister accepted that much. It was pure and simple political mechanisation to save his own skin, the fact that an ongoing investigation is coloured by it obviously wasn't his concern.",

So it's now happening. \n\nInitially why it didn't happen (esp for the Leadership since normal folk exiting Tibet wouldn't have had the means/funds to emigrate and neither would have West entertained them) I am is not sure. \n\nWest wouldn't have minded the Elites like DL coming to them but it is likely that DL himself didn't want to move abroad (possibly he felt by being closer to Tibetans, esp those coming from Tibet he'd have more leverage and be in the loop about what is happening rather than rely on intermediaries). \n\nChina also didn't want to create a Martyr by killing DL (besides he is also not a normal Separatist since he basically Re-Spawns to user gamer term, as idiotic as it is, that is what it is) so would have been moot play. But eliminating competent underlings would have been possible and a net positive (esp given hindsight now that things really didn't improve for Tibetan Exlies demands and China held firm on their stance).",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Five Eyes intelligence alliance backs Canada probe in Nijjar killing: What is it",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Canada's charge about India's involvement in the killing of Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was backed by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. The alliance which includes- US, UK, Australia, New Zealand other than Canada- called the accusations serious. The US said it was deeply concerned over Justin Trudeau’s claim about India’s role.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Well they should share the evidence with the country they're acussing of, at the very least Until evidence is produced no one can say much about the issue gotta wait for evidence If evidence is produced, what will your reaction be then? Would depend on evidence and ppl who are involved Well then let’s have it. Indians will probably be very happy if it's true, just saying Mr Trudeau has repeatedly asserted that he had raised the issue with the Indian government before. It's improbable that secret information of this kind will simply be revealed to the public. Doing so could jeopardise Canada's intelligence service. However, if all of India's allies (who desperately need it to counter China) are backing Canada on this, then we must pause and think. Then good job on RAW doing it, but shame on them for getting caught So if basically the evidence is given by people one doesn't like then the evidence can be discarded as motivation? I don't think even if was shared we would be knowing about it. Canada would say we shared the intelligence with India and India will say no such thing has been shared. Done deal. Media will run with lying West narrative and matter swept under rug. I think JT personally showed to modi on face last week but modi just won't do anything I never said that evidence needs to be produced and those involved need to be called out what happens after that is beyond me and you Pest control ain't wrong This essentially means India is open to similar ops from other countries. That is why this is such a big thing. Imagine other countries sending in agents to kill people they dont like. Didn't certain opponents of Putin mysteriously fall from hotel windows in Odisha? Russian MP vocal against Putin mysteriously fell from a hotel window in Odhisha Assuming Indian Government did had a role in this assassination, I still consider this deplorable. Indian diplomats were working hard since the last few years to project an image of the country as a “mother of democracy”. Media time and again called Modi’s governance as “vishwaguru”. Canada isn’t even an enemy territory and carrying out missions like these really goes on to tarnish the country’s image in the global stage. Reminds me of the time Saudi Arabia sent assassins to [kill a journalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi). Extra judicial killings are being supported by so many Indians in the name of nationalism. Seems like most people in India do not give a fuck about rule of law, ethics, and morality anymore. > The Washington Post, quoting a Western source, reported that the Five Eyes alliance refused to publicly condemn the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in a joint statement but \"privately raised’’ the issue before the G20 summit. Justin Trudeau also raised the issue with French president Emmanuel Macron, the report claimed. On the alliance, Australian PM Anthony Albanese said, “I don’t talk about Five Eyes intelligence at a press conference...we don’t speculate on what intelligence is.\" I have read the WaPo article, every country refused to condemn India during G20 summit. Read the article for yourself. Canada was completely isolated in its stance. The same thing goes on between India and Pakistan. We keep sharing evidence and they keep asking for more. And who condoned it? Probably shit places that want their oil for cheap. Do you know of any places like that? And who condoned it? Probably shit places that want their oil for cheap. Do you know of any places like that? Wow, imagine a similar line on killing of humans.. but now if those belong to your beloved faction? Wouldn't sit right, would it? Killing of terrorist should always be celebrated. Idgaf Not really. You wouldnt share the evidence of a murderer with the murderer while the investigation is ongoing, right? Modi and MBS aren’t that different Sounds good What morality does Khalistanis have? So you mean people who plan to kill innocent people and make crude motorcycle bombs are the terrorists and should be treated as such? I don’t understand how rabidly ALL the subs even the more liberal ones are saying “of course we have the right to kill terrorists wherever.” And the stupidest argument comparing him to fucking bin Laden. Till this came out I’ve never heard his name mentioned anywhere. Nytimes gets on record that even people in punjab including bjp party members had no fucking clue who he was. If he was the mastermind behind some terror attack sure at least make some argument. But if that was true he wouldn’t have been allowed to walk around freely in a country like Canada anyway. Obviously I think trying to carve a new theocracy out of India or anywhere is a bullshit idea but that doesn’t mean I’ll call anyone with that opinion a terrorist. If you want proof Canada has also ask proof to everyone calling him a terrorist. As someone said apparently this country can’t make up if they want to own up to this and say it’s justified or keep calling no evidence. I just don’t understand how the majority of idiots in our country think this is a hill to die on. Kill the fucking mosquitoes in the country then. \"Kiya hi nahi, kucch bhi\" \"Evidence dikhao, nahi to kucch nahi\" \"Evidence galat hai, compromised hai\" \"Haan kiya, lekin zaroori tha\" \"Oh shit, trade restrictions, visa restrictions, sanctions... consequences? Not like that?!\" Because it was diplomatically the annoying thing to do. Just like US making a deal with Saudi when they’re accused of the same shit. Why are you losing you minds over the death of a terrorist? Are you an separatist? If yes, hopefully you and family would meet a similar end soon ❣️ What happens is already beyond you. Just dont comment stupid shit. You wouldn't announce the result of an investigation when the investigation is still ongoing, Trudeau jumped the gun big time on this one. Coz right now they need us, coz china been fucking them over. Keeping relations good is for when they dont need us. Yes everyone in the world, ask the EU which in the one since the war started imported the most from Russia. India is a distant 3rd to EU and China. Show one actual news article of a EU nation saying it’s fine Russia kills people in other places. That wasn't what you asked, don't change the topic now when you have been proven wrong and for what it's worth India never said it's fine either. bhai jiski aukaat ho wo laga le trade aur visa restrictions. Phat k flowerpot ho jayegi unki bhi. 1999 mein bhi lagaye the humpe sanctions, kya ukhaad liya inhone hamara? as a nation, we're way too important right now in geopolitics and they need us more than we do. baki jisko iss fantasy world mein jeena h ki ye ho jayega wo ho jayega, toh woh jeeta rahe. Okay so I have seen people saying the Canadian PM is pushing this against India because it will help win him seats in elections that will be held in 2025. The problem with this is sikhs in canada is 2.1%. That is an extremely small minority , I find it very hard to believe that a country would make such big allegations just for such small numbers. The Current PM of Canada apparently has a very shitty reputation in the country What we are seeing right now is just the tip of the iceberg, both from India and Canada. Both sides are pushing their own narrative. rehne de bhai, he's living in some idealistic fantasy world of his where west good Russia bad and that's the end of it. I m really glad you're not in an important post. Anyone who goes with an attitude, \"i m too important, i m gonna go around be a bully, and not care about other important players\", may find safety temporarily. But eventually ends up on a path of self destruction. Oh no i have been proven wrong like what the fuck are you blabbering. The thread devolved into some subtopic so use that as an excuse because your brains heap memory can’t handle too many subjects? Its possible. But if he gets the backing of important countries and canadian allies by showing them the evidence... then thats a big deal. Kashoggi's evidence was not released either, eventually the audio was leaked to NYT by someone. But every big player already agreed that MSB was behind it, and releasing of evidence was not publicly required. There are many reasons why one would not want to publicly release evidence, one being you dont wanna compromise your sources, or you dont wanna interfere in an ongoing investigation. Rlnot releasing doesnt immediately mean it doesnt exist. Dude calm down tf down I can comment whatever I need to if u don't like it just move on your hatred is blinding you >What happens is already beyond you Ya but not beyond u mr ignorant snob I get that you had never heard of the guy. And I’m sure there are a lot of people and things you’ve never heard of. But perhaps, just maybe, that’s a very self centered approach to anything in life. The dude has been on India’s most wanted list for years. Trudeau was given his name along with others by the then Punjab CM CaptAmarinder Singh. Interpol had a red notice out for him. You do realise there are intelligence and security agencies constantly tracking and taking action against these sort of things, and they don’t need to advertise everything in NDTV prime time news. At the same time, yes, killing a foreign citizen in the manner alleged is wrong. But till now there’s no proof made public or any formal charges brought by police. Trudeaus carefully chosen word mash was drafted carefully to be more jumble and mumble, but essentially he has announced now that they would be investigating, and at the time of announcement it seems they didn’t have any evidence. Only “credible” allegations. So… allegations. Btw mr Nijjars close friend one Arsh Dalla had a congress politician murdered in Moga, Punjab yesterday, and then posted about it on Facebook claiming responsibility. While sitting in Canada with a Canadian citizenship. Do you think Canada should act against this guy? killing a terrorist is not bullying, it's serving justice. Bullying usko bolte h jo humko sanctions lagane ki dhamki dete the if we were to test nuclear weapons. Guess what, humne banaye bhi aur wo ghanta kuch nhi kar sakte humara. Iss baar bhi yhi hoga. It's time we pull down some nincompoops from their high horses and take down fuckers who create ruckus in our nation while sitting in comfortable shade of a terrorist harbouring nation like Canada. Its is not about the killing anymore. It is now a much larger issue that deals with geopolitics, that deals with how countries like China, Russia — and now India will been added to the mix. We will be seen as if we are influencing and trying to interfere in \"liberal\" democracies. We will be seen as necessary evil not an Ally. What happens, when/if tomorrow China is neutralised? Being an Ally or foe of a nation is not simply black and white, its a spectrum. Because things like this can have long term consequences, we might not face any issues from anyone today. Their politics, their public will hate us and we will be seen in the same camp as Russia, China, Saudi. We will be just a useful tool for them. There will be consequences just not the visible ones. Being an Ally is better than being a necessary evil. >The problem with this is sikhs in canada is 2.1%. That is an extremely small minority It's the concentration of population that matters more than just percentages. Calm down, you seem to be having some kind of a brain aneurysm. Im looking up the names you are mentioning and yes, Dalla seems to satisfy any sane definition of a terrorist and should be apprehended. The interpol seems to have issued a red notice for him as well. All news articles say he’s hiding in Canada that is not openly walking about. I haven’t found any articles from the Canadian side about what he’s classified as and what efforts have been put if any to hunt him. If he was assasinated then it might have been a more nuanced conversation, absolutely. But he wasn’t the one assasinated. Hardeep Singh was. Some articles say he’s associated with these terrorists. It may very well be true, but I didn’t see any direct links like what they are able to show for Dalla and other similar terrorists. You say Hardeep has a red notice but I don’t see any evidence of it anywhere. I would assume the NYT would mention it in an article named “who is Hardeep”. They do not. They are no being biased I don’t think because they make sure to mention his shady methods of acquiring Canadian citizenship among other facts. Do you have evidence or articles showing Hardeep had an interpol red notice? \"They should share the evidence\" lol do you think the Canadian government will speed post its intelligence reports to your house? This has likely already been communicated to India through diplomatic channels. After all, modiji is taking India to new heights on the international stage and we are reaping the extra 2ab from our ally Canada. I suppose I should be surrounded by people like this >Also is there a reason for not sharing evidence with India since the same has already been shared with the 5eye alliance Sharing the evidence exposes their sources to India. If they're trying to prevent India from committing more assassinations, that would be shooting themselves in the foot. It's not like the GOI protests anyone killing anyone here. I doubt if it was even investigated. Laws on how to engage countries exist for a reason. If everyone starts doing this, say good bye to national security. Did it make any difference in this specific context? How many seats does trudeau gain by doing what he did? He raised the issue during G20 sidelines, and apparently this news was about to hit the news. Canadian govt tried to buy some time, but the news agencies didn;t budge. They released the news minuted before Trudue's parliament speech, which changed the whole conversartion Oh I am not asking for evidence to be made public at all, I am saying does solid any evidence exist ? His exact words were, ***Credible allegations of a potential link****.* You have credible evidence not allegations, we know exactly who has been making these allegations for 3 months now but their own investigation agencies haven't made a single arrest in the meantime. Why would we trust anything that comes out after this point ? An ongoing investigation results have been announced before it concluded, the people who are actually doing the investigating now already have a predetermined conclusion given to them by the highest political figure in their land. I am sure they have solid investigation agencies but no matter how good an agency is, their results at this point onward are tainted. They already don't do that? So it really was like \"Oh no, but anyways\" meme I will wait for the sanctions. Lets see. If they do, and we dont point it out, it's our fault I guess. >1999 mein bhi lagaye the humpe sanctions, kya ukhaad liya inhone hamara? Delayed scientific progress by 20 years. Drastically slowed down investment in high tech industry, and therefore massively hurt our long term economic prospects. I am not that much verse in canadian politics. But from my understanding, currently it is a minority government so they Liberal party has to work with NDP and the leader of NDP party is sikh to form a majority government. There could be a case where liberal party is trying to appease the ndp party. Do check out this article where it explains how sikhs hold a lot of power in politics. Well, mudiji licks Arab arse, so there's that matter- slave relationship Trudeau also said that he personally raised the issue on his recent visit. I'm guessing an outline of the evidence would have at least been presented behind closed doors - find it hard to believe that it would have just been \"you did it, we have evidence.\" I guess govt. has decided to \"deny and underplay\" as their strategy, which I guess might work if they want to push this under the rug and let it fade in a week or so. Heard of pragya thakur, the self confessed terrorist who muddyji will never forgive? She's an mp. Tell us what you'd want to do to her. ok, and what we gained? we basically made sure that a full scale war bestowed on us by our unstable neighbours is out of the realms of possibility. We also told the west that we're not to be bullied by arbitrary rules that they've under the guise of intellectualism and \"peace\". I'll take the delay over continuous castration and humiliation at the hands of people who think they are superior to us any day. Purely speaking on basis of what I have read (which are Indian sources and thus biased), as many as 20% of seats in federal parliament are influenced by Sikh votes. These are closely contested seats decided by a few thousand votes and Sikh gurudwara practically act like US churches in rounding up as many votes as they can. That's the reason why all political parties in canada bend over backwards in showing their solidarity to sikhs who at the end of the day number less than a million. I am going out on a limb here and assuming you mean non India based articles. So I’m only giving you links to news houses who can be equally perceived to be not biased on the issue, on the same footing as NYT:- > A 2016 Interpol notice alleged that Nijjar was a “key conspirator” in the 2007 bombing of a cinema in Punjab. Nijjar was also accused of recruiting and fundraising, a charge that he denied, according to Global News. > Mr. Nijjar was accused by Indian officials of terrorism and designated a terrorist by New Delhi, leading authorities to place his name on Interpol’s wanted list, according to a report from the CBC. Coming to mr nijjars links with terrorist activities, the Indian police registered 10 cases against the man for various bombings murders and illegal activities. Which were flagged to the Canadian government long back. Here’s a news article from 2018 And another And one from 2023 April before the dude was shot, about ongoing criminal case against Nijjar and dalla as Co accused. This is more about the organisation he headed Obviously, the man won’t have a Facebook page declaring himself to be the leader because that will have him The Canadians haven’t indicated any proof of any Indian Govt involvement. I think Trudeau has jumped the gun to put diplomatic pressure on india and to save face with his electorate. Let’s see what they come up with, but at this stage I highly doubt there is any direct involvement. Exactly. Okay fair. He’s definitely on there as a likely mastermind. Thanks for the links. I still think it’s bullshit that india perpetrated an assassination on a country we want on our soil but this definitely muddies waters for me. Same things that should happen to jihadis and khalistanis Very well written bro. 👍 Yes, and their stance makes it appear that the process may have begun even earlier: We've obviously seen similar incidents before, but the fact that this issue was raised in such a open manner should raise some eyebrows. Canada doesn't really have the nationalistic environment that India does, which is why the gains Mr Trudeau could have from this are limited (and are likely worthless in comparison with the repercussions his statement will lead to). People have also compared the Khalistani to Osama, but I believe that the difference is that the person who was assassinated was not a declared terrorist by most nations (which was the case with Osama). It is true that Canada has been soft on Sikh terrorism, but we cannot ignore the reality that the US (which has not been as lenient aside from allowing Sikhs for Justice to exist due to their views on the freedom of speech) has also not said anything that would indicate a position that benefits India. They expressed their \"deep concern\" without saying much about respecting India's role in the democratic world. Surely jews in America and parsis in india are also an extremely small minority but hold vast amounts of influence and money. maybe its something similar that we are not aware off? They're just doing this for the giggles. These countries interfere in other countries all the time. I wonder what honorable Canadian citizen Akshay Kumar has to say about this. If i am not mistaken, many scientists working on nuclear submarine programme have died mysteriously. No country has the moral high ground to preach when it comes to geopolitics I honestly dunno about this. Would we really take such a huge risk to kill someone who wasn’t really a threat to India in anyway? I hadn’t even heard of him till it happened and i lived just an hour away from where he was killed. One thing the western countries are good at is banding together no matter what and They are very transactional with everyone else. They obviously cannot stand India being friendly with Russia and being non aligned. I am not saying 100% India didn’t do it. But it just doesn’t make sense that we did. Its one thing if we did this with someone like Dawood. There is already a growing sense of resentment towards Indians in Canada and indians are made the scrape goats for housing problems here and that narrative works well for the failed policies of the govt. Its also far from the truth. This accusation seems to have worked well to add fuel to that fire, so no one here seems to be in a mood to question the logic behind it at the moment. No one understands how diplomacy or sovereignty works. You cannot enter another nation and do what you want disrespecting their laws Its number of constituents you can win, not necessarily the percentage of votes So you want to equate our democratic country with a terrorist group? I don't believe Modi did this. Especially when he is working hard to project the image as you said. But if true, deplorable af. We're losing our image in a grand fashion Shocked pikachu face Now I don't feel safe shitting on Trump 😳 The only reason the GOI would protest that is because they don't like competition. As for national security, the BJP doesn't give a rat's arse about that. They've allowed a civil war type situation in a border state for months, and they took a woman who is out on bail facing terror charges and appointed her to the *Parliamentary Committee on Defence*. We just showed the world that we will be bully them and have their citizens assassinated when we have power. Why would they cooperate and help us develop? They already made that mistake with China. If they think we are the same, they aren't going to make another > Its is not about the killing anymore. It's very much about the killing. In India it's very normal to cancel your political opponents. Not how it works in true democracies. Yeah, you must be someone who has nothing going on in life. Some of us have shit to protect, careers that depend on economy and we also care about world respecting india. You should step away, and stay in your mammas basement. He did gave away his Canadian citizenship this year on 15th Aug. But who knows, maybe he's just back from completing an undercover mission. /s >The problem with this is sikhs in canada is 2.1%. That is an extremely small minority The issue with Canada is that Qubec does not vote for Trudeau's party or the main opposition party. Like ever. Therefore any national government has to be formed out of a majority from the rest of the states of Canada. Any small vote swing is enough for major electoral changes, hence the 2.1% sikhs are important. Looks like extra 2ab mil gaya .. He was not marked as terrorist by Canada. So from canadas perspective we simply killed a canadian. Even killing a terrorist without taking that country's help at all is bullying. Its undermining their sovereignty. Should canada start killing activists in india who are supporting 'make in india', and hurting canadian businesses? They can just call them 'terrorists' take no consultation from indian govt, and kill them. Would that work with you? Your talk is exactly like a bullys talk, when they thing the other side is not gonna do shit, and when they do retaliate the bully starts crying like a bitch. You are that bitch. So you want to justify a terrorist group because we are a democratic country? Basement? I am not as privileged as you, but all I have built is on my own. I will make a rap song about it. Its highly improbable hard sanctions will be applied. The comment was rhetorical. All the best for your career. I hope your contributions take the humanity forward. But that's going to happen mostly in China and USA, not retirement regions. What many dont realize is this stand can come back to bite them in their own arse. What if other countries start doing this to us and our citizens? If you avoid state to state dialogue and cant manage that amount of diplomacy, then WTF is the Diplomatic Corps doing? Machismo and posturing wont get you things in the long term that collaborating for things does. I suppose the only thing to do now would be to ask what is the proof they have. If the 5 eye intel teams agree, I would think the proof is probably pretty solid, but we should still would want to know. what a genius, equating make in India to a terrorist who is accused of bombing a theatre. Big brain move mate. Canada didn't mark him as a terrorist, that's exactly why I am saying that canada is a safe haven for terrorists and their government is in bed with those terrorists. What isn't clicking? and it isn't bullying to take the trash out. India made multiple requests to Canada for his extradition but Canada denied it. When namaste doesn't work, sometimes you have to twist the arm or safe harborers of terrorists assume that our requests are our weakness. It is not about Sikh votes only, Trudeau is being hammered on Chinese interference in Canada since many months. And if he did not get ahead of this story even a small leak would have made him look way worse. The candian intel diplomat asked to leave india was tit for tat for the indian intel diplomat asked to leave canada. I am sure the candian side proved by intel to the indians. >they took a woman who is out on bail facing terror charges and appointed her to the Parliamentary Committee on Defence. Can you please tell me who this is. Google hasn't been a help. It will also expose Indian sources. Modi/BJP clan is akin to an abusive husband. Tried to be all glossy to the outside world but a b**** at home. Now the veneer to the outside world is also slowly fading (not that they didn’t know before hand he was a ****+) But it doesn't get traced back to him If it gets traced to India, then it will intelligence failure >imported the most from Russia That doesn't mean they condone Russia's actions U don't get it Issue is getting caught. Pragya Thakur. Hon'ble MP from the marvelous city of Bhopal. The only thing she was known for before this, was being a terrorist and [a devotee of that great patriot of India, Mahatma Nathuram Godse](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-refers-to-godse-as-patriot/article33568997.ece/amp/). I wonder if all the idiots celebrating India's \"masterstroke assassination\" remember just how much intelligence support India [got during the Mumbai attacks](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fbi-help-proved-crucial-in-tracing-2611-attackers-boat-to-pak/article62022759.ece). It allowed us to not only pursue action against those who had funded the attacks from other countries, but became the basis of a massive international isolation of Pakistan which allowed us to maintain pressure on them for years. That had also, for quite a while, allowed us to also enhance our strategic presence in Afghanistan. That's the sort of cooperation and engagement we're actively pissing away here. The next time a major attack happens in India, none of these organizations will receive the political authorization to work with India. Not unless the government makes concessions in some areas, or there is explicit and immediate value for another country. India just blew up years worth of goodwill, not just from Canada, but every major country allied with Canada or atleast keen to keep them conciliated. Definitely alliances like the Five Eyes grouping. All for a non entity of an activist with the barest influence over problems in Punjab. And because instead of continuing to push after filing for extradition and gathering and providing evidence, they became impatient. Yes Canada's political groups often collaborate with separatist elements. But these sorts of domestic pressures ebb and flow as elections are close or not. As political parties change. For fuck's sake. (Thanks btw) Issue isn't morality. Issue is cost benefit analysis Is some chest thumping really worth exposing intelligence assets, international awkwardness, and potential humiliation? There is nothing difficult in killing them. U can get some money and hire some assassin's to kill them when they are out for jog. Problems arise when u get caught But above comment questioned morality. > Would we really take such a huge risk to kill someone who wasn’t really a threat to India in anyway? That is exactly the sort of reckless faux machismo cowboy behavior I'd expect from our current PM. It's exactly the \"shoot first, ask questions later\" attitude that he demonstrated during Demonetization. In case it isn't clear, these may be good attributes if you're a scrum master, but they are not good attributes if you're running a country of 1.5 billion people. So I think our govt is fully capable of thinking they could do this. I still am not convinced they had the ability to actually execute it, and the only reason for my skepticism is that right now all we have is an allegation from Trudeau. True I did not even know about him before he was killed. He wasn't some hafeez Saeed level person. Too much risk The Sikhs are indeed small in numbers, but they have a lot of money in Canada. They can be campaign donors and other types of influential financiers. That said currently the Liberal/NDP coalition might be what's driving this more than voting blocks itself. Bold of you to assume that the people who are celebrating this can think about all these long term consequences Morality is getting caught It might be considered some sort of james bond level Mission. But if u had to expose ur assets to kill one person walking on the road with no security and a person who isn't even direct threat to India then it was stupidity. > the leader of NDP party is sikh yes but the NDP is not a Sikh party. they couldn't care less about Khalistan. I mean BJP got mandate from 30% of population yet got overwhelming majority. Sikh refugees in Canada are spread out unlike Indian Punjab, so their votebank can certainly matter in places. Then say that the execution was wrong. What question morality? Thank you for elaborating the point eloquently. Realize that Trudeau is trying to salvage flagging popularity ratings. He needs to appear as a \"strong statesman\". Making baseless allegations against India resolves both, his statesmanship issue as a defender of Canadian sovereignty, and also panders to Sikhs in Canada, especially the extremist fringe, who punch far above their weight politically in Trudeau's liberal party. All he has to do is repeat the line that the evidence is \"classified\" but \"credible\" so he never has to produce it, and enough Canadians will believe him to make a difference to his ratings. He can always say \"India Human Rights Bad\" whenever India raises the point about the lack of evidence. Canada did that same thing when they didn't bother properly investigating the Sikh extremist airline bombing of IA 182, when the bomb was planted Canada, for 20 years after the bombing. They simply resort to whataboutery when questioned about what they're doing about their Sikh extremism problem. > Weeks before Trudeau’s announcement, Canada had asked its closest allies, including Washington, to publicly condemn the killing, according to a Western official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a diplomatically sensitive matter. But the requests were turned down, the official said. >A spokeswoman for Canada’s foreign minister said claims that “Canada asked allies to publicly condemn the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, and were subsequently rebuffed, are false.” why would they ask for public condemnation before announcing publically themselves. That's a completely docent point. I'm calling out op on the assertion that 2.1%sikh votes matter. the US also asked india to cooperate with the investigation, which is significant: it means india is not cooperating. despite top level intel people from canada coming to india just for this. Some level of evidence still must be made public else people will be taken for a ride again like on iraq. At some point importance of classifying intel to protect intelligence apparatus becomes insignificant vs the ramifications the claims can cause. Especially since this incident looks to be getting used as an excuse to restrict the movement of Indian immigrants to tackle housing and cost crisis in Canada. Majority of their sub are demanding it and so government now has the consent of their people. he had no choice. the news was already out. canadian press was about to publish. Interpol Red Notice is not an arrest warrant. If india had evidence it should have sought extradition from Canada, with whom we have an extradition treaty. the fact this did not happen means Indian evidence would not stand up in Canadian extradition proceedings. As someone who has roots in Punjab and hashing proximity on ground, Punjab has an ongoing gangster problem. There’s killings everyday by or of some gangster. The nexus between Canada based gangs/ militants/ groups, including the same organisations and people who are involved in Khalistani movements (who also rely on criminal activities to raise cash, guns, etc.) is well known by now. * * * * * * * Killings by and of gangsters in Punjab and Canada are a common occurence due to this nexus and rivalries:- This is literally yesterday: > A local Congress leader was shot dead at his house in Dala village of Moga district late on Monday. Police said that Baljinder Singh Balli (45), who was also locally known as ‘namberdar’, was shot twice. While one bullet pierced his chest, the other hit his thigh. Balli was the block president of Ajitwal village for the Congress party. Police said that two assailants came on a bike. While one entered the house, the other kept waiting outside. > Hours after the incident, fugitive gangster Arshdeep Singh Gill alias Arsh Dalla, also a native of Dala village but believed to be hiding in Canada, took to Facebook and claimed responsibility for the killing. In a Facebook post purportedly posted from Arsh Dalla’s account, he blamed Balli for ‘introducing him in the world of crime’ and for ‘harassing his mother’. A very famous case of the death of Sidhu Moosewala: > Moose Wala was shot dead by unidentified assailants on 29 May 2022; a Canada-based gangster, active in Punjab, claimed responsibility for the killing, which the police said was the culmination of an inter-gang rivalry.[15] > Punjab-origin gangster Amarpreet Samra alias Chakki, 28, was reportedly shot dead in Canada’s Vancouver in the early hours of Sunday when he was coming out of a wedding venue. > According to reports in the local newspaper Vancouver Sun, Samra was on the dance floor at Fraserview Banquet Hall with other guests less than 30 minutes before he was killed at Fraser Street around 1.30 am. > Samra was reportedly with the ‘UN Gang’, and according to sources, he was shot by men belonging to a rival gang called ‘Brothers Keeper Group’. > Both the brothers are involved in drug trafficking in the US and Canada. Both of them have huge stakes in the business with their rival gangs which included the Brothers, the keepers group, Wolfpack, and the red scorpion group. More info about more such cases in the past from another article about the same incident:- > Vancouver Sun also reported that Samra was the intended target of another attempt in May 2021, but a case of mistaken identity led to the murder of correctional officer Bikramdeep Randhawa instead. Samra is not the first listed gangster to be killed. Among those listed in 2021 was Meninder Dhaliwal. He didn’t figure in the 2022 list because on July 24 that year, he was gunned down in the town of Whistler, along with Satindera Gill. Two persons were arrested in that regard: 24-year-old Gursimran Sahota and 20-year-old Tanvir Khakh, both from the town of Surrey. In May 2021, Dhaliwal was also among six gangsters identified by the Vancouver Police Department as posing a danger to the public simply because they were potential targets for rival gang members. > Gurjant Singh, 30, was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne men when he was working at his garments shop at Deenpur village of Tarn Taran on Tuesday. > Canada-based gangster Lakhbir Singh, alias Landa, who is wanted by Punjab Police in several criminal cases, has taken the responsibility for the murder of a shopkeeper in the border district of Tarn Taran through his alleged Facebook account. Yeh Inka roz ka hai. They are their own worst enemies. I think it’s far more likely the gentleman’s death, owing to his proximity to criminal activities, was under similar circumstances. Sincerely hope it’s literally just them killing each other. Lawyers in a case do share information between parties before a hearing, unlike what gets shown on TV. It's not necessary to reveal informants or intel processes that led to it, just the results of the findings like photos, audio, location and transaction histories. It's not like RAw could destroy evidence now after getting caught. Why our terrorists ur \"citizens\" US would never do such things . Does anyone even bother to even read about what they are posting about? They sought his extradition in 2022. Official channels were moved. > Over the years, India had, several times, communicated its concerns about Nijjar's links to terrorist activities. In 2018, former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh handed over a list of wanted persons to Justin Trudeau with Nijjar's name included. > Then in 2022, the Punjab Police sought the extradition of Nijjar as he was wanted in cases related to spreading terrorism in the state. > Nijjar was wanted in several cases, including the 2007 blast that killed six and injured 42 in the city of Ludhiana in Punjab. Here is a news report from that time what morality you have if your morality is based on the morality of your opponents? some guy involved with the Kanishka bombing was killed in a very similar way last year in Surrey itself. almost certainly same people. they figured they'll get away again i guess. > Over the years, India had, several times, communicated its concerns about Nijjar's links to terrorist activities. This is not an extradition request. for reference see the Vijay Mallya extradition case. it's a judicial process they have to send lawyers file court documents. > Then in 2022, the Punjab Police sought the extradition of Nijjar as he was wanted in cases related to spreading terrorism in the state. Sounds like the extradition failed in the courts. Where does it sound like that to you? the extrdition process can only end in 2 ways: rejected, or actual extradition. So where does it say it failed or even reached its logical conclusion. I’m assuming you would know that the vijay Mallya extradition case is ongoing till now since 2018. > though in this case i don't hink the actualy extradition was filed in the courts, or there would be info online. The news report says it was filed. It quotes a senior officer of the Punjab police. I think you’re going out of your way to draw conclusions. Stop living in fantasy world. You can never be moral with an immoral who is seeking your destruction. Be moral and they will succeed. 😂 Great analogy All countries do it. You think KGB or CIA have not killed people in India? shark_breed 2h >ok, and what we gained? we basically made sure that a full scale war bestowed on us by our unstable neighbours is out of the realms of possibility. We had ensured that in 1974, with the first successful nuclear test. 1999 tests didn't add anything beyond the demonstration of the capability to produce and explode nuclear weapons. Ergonomic then and producing higher yield as well as tactical weapons, refining delivery systems, targeting systems, etc. requires much much more testing, which was never on the books. The biggest achievement of the 1999 tests was to help Pakistan official become a nuclear nation. Till then, they had not demonstrated capability. Our 1999 tests provided them the opportunity. >We also told the west that we're not to be bullied by arbitrary rules that they've under the guise of intellectualism and \"peace\". Lmfao. We literally gave up the moral ground from which we should have been hectoring the west to cut down and eventually eliminate its nuclear arsenal, that will eventually cause massive pain and suffering to all of humanity. >I'll take the delay over continuous castration and humiliation at the hands of people who think they are superior to us any day. You'll also take mandirs and statues instead of schools, colleges, hospitals, research institutions, scientific and human progress. We know. Did India present evidence? It doesn't matter. You're not realizing the long term consequences of letting go of the higher moral ground. Next time a country like US carries out an extrajudicial killing in india, which they do routinely in african south american countries, india will have no ground to stand on saying, \"thats not cool\", AND canada, UK, aus will not support that call. They ll say fuck you, you did that. So sanction, no sanction, its juts bad for india, if not repaired quickly. Your attitude of \"jo ukhaadna hai ukhaad lo\" is childish. This is not your 5th grade playground. No, dummy, equating 2 extra judicial killings. You take one step down, they take two steps down. You think they're gonna go, \"oh, new rules, extrajudicial killings are allowed ONLY if its a terrorist\"?!! FUCK NO, dunbass! They're gonna go, \"rules gaye bhaad me, jo beech me ayega india me hi ukhad denge\" Yeah, this is not a court case. Treudo is not fighting in a court. He is fighting to get support from political leaders of other countries. > Then in 2022, the Punjab Police sought the extradition of Nijjar that could mean anything. maybe they just prayed every night for a miraculous extradition. did they put to together a legal team and file paperwork? no. Canada has a functioning legal system. Cases don't just get sat on like in our glorious country. so you have no morals of your own, and you expect everyone to have no morals either. When did the CIA kill PPL in India? Any evidence? I agree it used to happen a lot during the cold war, but most western countries have avoided in recent times because it brings a bad reputation. Remember wikileaks. No, I know they don't have morals. And I am not willing to act morally with them anymore. by definition you are correct, but if you look at the opinion article, it explains how sikhs hold a lot of power in politics. > no. See the other report from 2022. They’ve filed extradition requests as per treaty and the allegation is that Canada is doing exactly that, lol, sitting on the requests without taking any decision. Here’s the procedure under the treaty:- >Article 8 > Extradition Procedures > The request for extradition shall be made through diplomatic channels and shall be supported by the following: > * information concerning the identity, description, and location of the person sought; > * a statement of the facts of the case, and > * a statement of the laws of the requesting State > * describing the offence and the punishment therefor. > Where the request for extradition is for a person accused of an extradition offence it shall also be supported by: > * a copy of the warrant of arrest, and such evidence as, according to the laws of the requested State, would justify his arrest and committal for trial if the offence had been committed within its jurisdiction including evidence showing that the person sought is the person to whom the warrant of arrest refers. > Where the request for extradition is for a person convicted of an extradition offence it shall be supported by: > a copy of the certificate of conviction or a copy of the judgement or order of conviction; and evidence that the person sought is the person to whom the conviction refers; and, if such person was sentenced, by: a copy of the judgement or order of sentence; and a statement showing what portion of the sentence remains to be served. Here’s a news report about India’s allegations on Canada:- > At least nine separatist organisations supporting terror groups have their bases in Canada and despite multiple deportation requests Ottawa has taken no action against those involved in heinous crimes including the killing of popular Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, officials said on Tuesday. > Multiple dossiers have been handed over to the Canadian side but India's deportation requests have gone unaddressed, they said, adding at least nine separatist organisations supporting terror groups have found their bases in Canada. > Eight individuals involved in terror activities and as many gangsters, who have been conspiring with Pakistan's ISI, have found a safe haven in Canada, the officials said. > They said that deportation requests for these people -- including Gurwant Singh who was involved in terrorist activities in early 1990s -- have been pending with the Canadian authorities for years now. An Interpol Red Corner Notice is also pending against him. > The officials said Indian authorities had requested for the deportation of Gurpreet Singh, who is also involved in terror cases, and provided his Canadian address but no action was taken. > They said the request for deportation of dreaded gangsters including Arshdeep Singh alias Arsh Dalla, wanted in 16 criminal cases, Satinderjit Singh Brar alias Goldy Brar, who took responsibility for killing of famous Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, had been submitted with evidence against them but no action was taken by the Canadian government. i went though that article and it refrains from saying extradition was sought for Nijjar specifically. It lists a whole host of others tho. never heard of this paper. is there a better source. the article plays fast and loose with words like \"handed over multiple dossiers\", \"requested the deportation\", and \"extradition requests\", all of which mean different things. the fact that you don't see the ability to actually produce and explode nuclear weapons as something pathbreaking goes to show how little you know about all of this. Also, don't throw around the \"further development and refining is never on the books\" because none of that took place after smiling Buddha. the Emergency and further governments little to nothing to actually further the nuclear program till 1995. We weren't designing some huge payloads and/or smaller tactical nukes. We basically were doing \"ji huzoori\" to the west. Why should we even have that moral High ground. our position was that we should also be nuclear capable and the whole ordeal of only 5 nuclear countries is arbitrary and extremely discriminatory. Why exactly are you trying to shadowbox arguments that were never made? also, what exactly happened to that cutting down? Because as I see it, the two nations who were in that arms race still have about 50x the total warheads we have. At the height of the cold war, they already made so many that even a slight reduction changes nothing. their total warheads can still destroy the earth multiple times. haan bhai, west Wale to humare fufaji lag rhe the na Jo aake schools, colleges aur hospitals banate. We already know how many colleges, schools and hospitals they built in nations that had no nuclear weapons between 92 and 2010. these are the same people who were willing to attack us in 1971 so pardon me if I don't really believe in their hospitality and \"care\" for us. I too have a mixed response to everything. We have to atleast acknowledge that activity of khalistani leaders has risen, and so has activity against them > Just a few days before Nijjar's killing, Khalistan leader Avtar Singh Khanda died in UK's Birmingham on June 15. Khanda was suffering from cancer but his supporters alleged that the chief of the Khalistan Liberation Force had been poisoned. > On May 6, Khalistan Commando Force chief Paramjit Singh Panjwar was shot dead near his residence in Lahore when he was out for a morning walk. > In July 2022, Ripudaman Singh Malik, an accused in the 1985 Air India bombing, was killed in Canada's Surrey. > In January 2020, Harmeet Singh was killed outside a gurdwara in Lahore. I want to see hard facts and not rely on speculation. But the matter seems suspicious. Don’t forget ‘Bulldozer Yogi Shree Dhongi’ China most definitely is not Killing Tibetans inside India. So many countries indeed do it but not All (major ones since it's moot to suggest Fiji is murdering someone on other countries, etc). Also from the post-title question, > What is it It's basically the thing that rules this Planet, for now. 5 Eyes is THE most powerful State-Network that exists currently in the world. No NATO or even China-Russia combined partnership is a match for it currently (simply because of non-Military domain vectors, it's Intelligence and Media apparatus is unmatched). LEMOA/LSA (2016), COMCASA (2018), BECA (2020) had already been signed between US-India. This is also a huge part of why India-China relations took a nosedive in 2010s. These 3 Agreements are not trivial, they are of massive significance. US is not also Agreement bound so maybe India took this step after having gotten these de jure ratifications. US could reduce the amount of Information sharing, etc but it won't be able to cut it outright. India played US/West here. Maybe it overplayed it's hand (very likely since this person was not that relevant and 2nd you don't just bitch slap an underling inside the Imperial Core. Canada is that underling. Slapping it makes US look bad because Canada on its own is nothing). I’m not saying they are accusing because of this. But 2.1% is more important than you think. You need to consider Quebec which doesn’t vote for the two main parties. Also Sikhs have the tendency to vote in blocks based on their Gurudwar. So 2% doesn’t translate to 2% of seats. It’s actually about how many seats they have influence. I don’t think he showed anything. But likely brought it up with Modi. That’s probably the reason he was snubbed If equivalence was applied, it wouldn't exist in the No 1 or near its vicinity slots, but it isn't if the shoe is/would-be on the other foot. Imagine another State killing Indians inside India. If Indians were like, this is bad but price of being a major world state, lets carry on. But what is most likely going to happen is hysterical over-reactions because how dare someone do that to us. We already have \"Thok do saale ko\" culture. Others can also join in. Certainly. Anyone who saw how many of our nuclear scientists died in *mysterious circumstances\" can tell something is always up. It's all a matter of \"Jiski lathi badi us hi ki bail'. All developed nations have carried out extrajudicial killing. The outrage is mostly, \"How dare they?\". Not that I support any country indulging in such assassinations, including India. But if we had to shame or punish countries who have done this, then a lot of skeletons will have to be dug out. For Trudeau the best case scenario is the US and UK take strong stand to condemn Indias actions. Like they did with MBS and Khassoggi. Worst case is feeble opposition. Like they are doing now- lip service. So far it’s not looking too good for Trudeau. I really don't understand why they'd assassinate this guy. Like, there are bigger fishes we've had our eyes on. This guy is a relative non entity. And then to do it on the white man land is really too much because things likes these do see light of the day. I really don't think India would do it. And they'd definitely not risk it before the g20 These things are done privately unlike Ms. JT who was happy he could blame India for something after the G20 cold response. Tibetians don't engage in terrorist activities across the border. They live in exile and their stand is geopolitical activism to garner support. Khalistanis on the other hand have actively promoted violence and destruction as a path for secession. What in the heck are you on about. Tibetans LITERALLY were an armed insurgency funded by US AND were LITERALLY getting air-dropped on air sorties conducted from East Pakistan. Guess where the flight path goes through, TLDR, NOT through South Pole. Tibetans have a LITERAL Govt-in-Exile. Their leader is a Living God of their Religion (or the dominant sect less one belives the propaganda that all Tibetans are just 1 thing, they're not). And that Religious leader won a Nobel Prize and has direct access to corridors of Power at a world stage that hardly has peers among Seperatists. Guess what? THAT LITERALLY counts as State sabotage & seperatist activity. Or are you one of those who think there is only and only 1 way to skin a chicken? Remind me again which Khalistani leader (THE Undispted Leader of ALL Khalistani separatism that is not isolates) get to regularly have Private meets at White House? And then Indians (most likely of your sort since no one coherent enough in history could write the trite you just did) whine and hysterically flip out when Naxalts or NE insurgencies are mentioned as someone some giant conspiracy directly abetted by the Chinese. And lastly, the immediate and precipitating cause of the most devastating war in last 150 years of Indian history (1962, not just the result by the long-term consequences of it) was the result of Tibetans and their Seperatist activities (which were nearly exclusively from India, a direct next door neighbour). Canada DOES NOT border India, last anyone checked a map. Khalistan as a REAL impending threat to the Indian State exists on a Lower Hierarchy of Significance (comprehend what spectrum means on a non-Binary thing) than Tibetan Separatism exists for PRC. What the OP comment about said was mostly correct, nearly All countries do do this sort of thing. Which is why China NOT doing is what makes them an outlier & rarity, esp when Degree/Level/Gradient of the threat is accounted for. US calls it concerning? US?! US is like the epitome of hypocrisy. 😂 US has a long history of such stuff (cough Fidel Castro cough). Oh no he had a choice, he could have simply said we can't comment in an ongoing investigation. He deliberately choose to save his political skin instead of doing the mature thing and in the process ensure that the entire thing turns political. the Globe and Mail published the intelligence assessment minutes before he spoke in parliament. so actually, he wasn't even the first one to reveal it. The solution wasn't to be in a rush on who told what first, the solution is not to comment on what is still an ongoing investigation of sensitive nature and international importance. Trudeau wasn't rushing to be first. He wanted the investigation to complete before speaking about it. But an intel whistleblower had leak the details to the Globe & Post. Trudeau asked them to hold off a week but they said only 24 hrs. >Trudeau wasn't rushing to be first. He wanted the investigation to complete before speaking about it. Of-course he was, his speech and the news published within 30 minutes of each other. The parliament was already in session when the news published, the main objective behind announcing it in such a dramatic manner is to preempt any criticism for *hiding it.* Even though hiding it is the more responsible thing to do when till all facts has been established. India just went and shat on a whole raft of binding international agreements about the sovereignty of nations. You think they'll have any leverage to insist America keeps following others? They could piss all over it now and all India will be able to do is whine about it. He hasn't announced the results of the investigation. The media was aware that the assassination was carried out by agents of India, and they'd already released that to the public. The PM of a country announcing that they have evidence of the assassination of a Canadian by foreign powers on Canadian soil is called being transparent with the public. I am sure “ghar mein ghus kar maara”. /s. Akki is lifting this story now. An ace actor, attains a foreign citizenship, now in cahoots with the govt, asked to carry out a spy mission in his citizenship country to save his reputation and career, he agrees but first surrenders the citizenship and retakes India’s, goes to the mission, kills the bad guy and comes back. His next movie becomes a superhit after a long lineup of duds. As if it didn’t happen before. Should have a look at how a lot of our scientists died mysteriously. It doesn’t happen anymore though. >> The Washington Post, quoting a Western source, reported that the Five Eyes alliance refused to publicly condemn the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in a joint statement but \"privately raised’’ the issue before the G20 summit. Justin Trudeau also raised the issue with French president Emmanuel Macron, the report claimed. Trudeau: Hey Macron, these guys killed one of my people. Macron: ok, can you buy a few Rafale jets? Trudeau: Hmm, no? Macron: Alors tu peux te faire foutre. Then India should take some tips from Russia Mumbai attacks we got intelligence because a load of western citizens including Israelis were killed. There are 100s of situations where we didn’t get any shit. A lot of our scientists got killed - pretty sure it’s CIA plus the so called moral wests involvement. Yes. And now you've gone and made yourself the country that kills western citizens. Starting to understand how this little thing about self interest works? Anyone read this ? Covert operations happen all the time. We had a really scary terror reign in Punjab from the khalistanis in the late 70s to late 80s. It was worse than Kashmir militancy where in Kashmir was just around a few isolated areas of Kashmir but Khalistani terrorism was violent throughout most of north india to down as Pune. They managed to assassinate prominent figures including our PM. They bombed a plane with children and babies. GOi is rightfully worried about the newly raising khalistanis and don’t want them to go full throttle like the 80s. Numerous requests to tackle them was rejected by Canada. I don’t blame the RAW at all for doing such an act. They managed to kill four of them in UK, in Pakistan and Canada. Just imagine these mother fuckers in close hands with Pakistan! What did Pakistan did to us? Even recently? I was well aware of the violence during 80s I was a kid but it’s a daily menace. Probably you were not even born! Uh huh. Carte blanche to kill whoever you want, without trial, without confirmation of guilt. Totally fine. But when Pakistan does it, it's terrorism. Problem is, when you aren't the biggest mofos around and need some aid, to the western countries whose citizens you've been executing, you're not so different anymore. And that's when that self interest you're pounding comes to bite you in the ass. Keep pounding your chest and thinking this was super smart to start waging asymmetric war against the West. Toss out decades of careful diplomatic policy to execute one dude who was a child when the last bout of violence happened in the 80s. Genius move there. But I realize talking about little things like rule of law isn't always worth it in India. This is a country that takes great pride in jailing people on trumped up charges and holding them indefinitely without charges or evidence. Especially minorities. Now they're exporting that shit abroad. And there will be consequences bud. Doesn't matter to me if you're a kid or a boomer. The fact that you don't seem to understand how this shit works tells me enough. Your justifications don't change the fact that what India just did is not very different from the shit Pakistan pulls. In the past the fact that India was different gave it leverage. Leverage it used such as in the aftermath of the Bombay terror attacks. But the supreme leader with his masterful understanding of entire political science doesn't need to worry about that right? Everyone's just going to bow down to us because... reasons I guess. Right! A Pakistani giving moral lessons.! I only read the first two lines! Now piss of to your stupid nation! Lol, it's cute that you think I'm Pakistani. I do agree my nation has been very stupid though. I've got no desire to piss off to it though since they've made it clear they'll happily jail folks with the wrong opinions, call them terrorists, urban naxals or anti nationals, and now they've escalated to murdering foreign citizens in broad daylight in other countries. It's ok though. I understand you didn't want to read too much. Reading is hard. And it's easier to just wallow in baseless nationalistic pride and think you're something special. Nobody is going to give a fuck about this. This will settle down in a few days. There are much important problems for the world to worry about. India will continue to buy cheap oil from Russia, war planes from France, continue to manufacture for the west, Send tickets to space Yourself and Trudeau can go f*ck themselves and keep sulking living in an utopian world. And your point about keeping in jail indefinitely- yep jihadis like you are kept in prison forever you lot shouldn’t see the light of day. And oh well, that’s what the west and Europe doing now as well. Pakistan used to think the same. As did Russia. It's the fallacy of authoritarian idiots to assume that they will always be different. Always protected. Immune from consequences. It's odd that you've got such a strong sense of national pride and grievance, that you hold onto disputes and events from half a century ago. But seem to think them dumb westerners have no memory at all and will just forget everything overnight. I'm guessing you think you're super smart while the rest of the world is just filled with idiots eh? But it's nice to at least get an open acknowledgement about little things like law don't matter. Best pray you never end up with the government disagreeing with your politics though? Might end up called a jihadi and jailed without a trial too. But let me guess. That would never happen to you. Never ever. Totally not. Surely not to an ubermensch. But doesn't the ccp committe thank their lucky red stars or whatever over the years that Dalai didn't go to US/UK or even France instead ? All this without the Canadian side providing a shred of evidence. >I honestly dunno about this. Would we really take such a huge risk to kill someone who wasn’t really a threat to India in anyway? I was making the same point in another thread. Unless there was an immediate risk to indian lives and no other way of avoiding it, this shouldn't have been done. Also now that this news has leaked this will give more momentum to their fringe movement than anything he could have done. People are comparing it to America assasinating Iranian general, but they seem to forget Iran is an hostile govt for America they dont care about their relations. Canada on the other hand is a friendly nation, assasination a citizen is obviously a very bad step. Even US Saudi's relationship has been frosty since Khashoggi was murdered. Indians might get a kick out of extra judicial killings like this and quote their favorite Akshay Kumar movies, but rule of law based countries will balk at it. The western nations are wary of anyone who does not follow rule of law, the implications will be distrust in every interaction with Indian govt >He hasn't announced the results of the investigation. No he has done much worse, he has announced out loud the **possible** result of the investigation before the investigation concluded. &#x200B; >The media was aware that the assassination was carried out by agents of India, Trudeau exact words were ***Credible allegations of a potential link***, it might change in the future but you have credible evidence not allegations. Whatever they think they have doesn't seem to fit the criteria to be called an evidence otherwise Trudeau would have said evidence. &#x200B; >The PM of a country announcing that they have evidence of the assassination of a Canadian by foreign powers on Canadian soil is called being transparent with the public. Read his statement in parliament and tell me where he used the word evidence, he didn't and he didn't do it out of some higher ideal. He did it because it was going to come out in press, his own minister accepted that much. It was pure and simple political mechanisation to save his own skin, the fact that an ongoing investigation is coloured by it obviously wasn't his concern. Tibetan Exile's diaspora (that went to India, Nepal and esp their children and grandchildren now) are moving outside of India (not all but it's noticeable amount now) to Western countries (like Swiss, UK, US, Canada, etc). So it's now happening. Initially why it didn't happen (esp for the Leadership since normal folk exiting Tibet wouldn't have had the means/funds to emigrate and neither would have West entertained them) I am is not sure. West wouldn't have minded the Elites like DL coming to them but it is likely that DL himself didn't want to move abroad (possibly he felt by being closer to Tibetans, esp those coming from Tibet he'd have more leverage and be in the loop about what is happening rather than rely on intermediaries). China also didn't want to create a Martyr by killing DL (besides he is also not a normal Separatist since he basically Re-Spawns to user gamer term, as idiotic as it is, that is what it is) so would have been moot play. But eliminating competent underlings would have been possible and a net positive (esp given hindsight now that things really didn't improve for Tibetan Exlies demands and China held firm on their stance). > The problem with this is sikhs in canada is 2.1% I think it's a sometimes key swing vote though; demographics that always vote the same way don't get the same energy devoted to keeping them How is this any different from the Saudi's murdering the US journalist. Canada condemned Saudi for that. Why wouldn't Canada condemn India for this? Saw somewhere a local publication was going to run this story and JT wanted to save face and said it before the publication did. He's already under heat with the Chinese pulling these stunts there beforehand."
