        "I am a huge tekken fanatic. Been playing tekken for ages. 1997 in parlours. I used to stand there staring at the screen for hour. No coins no money. Just pure facination. I became one of the best players in town beating people at local game parlours and feeling like a king those days. \nNow i ejoy all the titles on my PC.\nMax Payne 2. The first game i cracked. Took me a while before I could do it. It came around 2003. Me and my brother were over whelmed, when we saw max doing the bullet time. Crazy era for gaming. \nI now mod GTA 5 and 4. Experimenting stuff. I am planning to make one game for my family where every character is from my family. I am also including my Doggo in that. Can't wait on my New VR setup and PC hardware to arrive so i can start modelling all my relatives and family.",

        "I'm planning on  playing Spiderman 2018 because I got a PS4 but can't afford to right now due to budget constraints. \n\nI've seen gameplay footage of it and it looks amazing, no pun intended. I've played the PS2 version on my friends console and it blew my mind as a kid. Am hoping it would have a similar feel now as well. From what I've heard they've nailed it in the 2018 one too. \n\nWon't be able to get it for now, but soon lol.",
