        "Yup. Saving all fragile for AR 45. Might use original for low level domain rather than ley line blossom. I see more value there tbh.",
        "Yup, a much better option. I'm AR 55, and I rarely do blossoms even now. The game gives you enough Mora and Adventure books through the Battle Pass and the events, so you can make do without doing the blossoms unless you're in a hurry to level up a particular character.\n\nYou will feel a Mora pinch as your characters reach Lvl70+ and their talents go 6+, but that can be remedied by doing bounties, requests, and an occasional Wealth blossom or two in a week. No need to dedicate a large amount of your resin to it. Honestly, just take your time with leveling your characters up, embrace the RNG, and you'll enjoy the game's grind.",
        "Yup. All about the journey mate, all about the journey.",

        "Oh, of course. But 4 stars lose their value in end game when compared to 5 stars. Fragile Resins are a rare commodity, so best to save them for 5 stars, even if you can't guarantee a good 5 star artifact by using them.  If nothing, your shit 5 star artifacts are a better level up fodder for good artifacts than a whole bunch of worthless 4 stars.\n\nPersonally I don't even use my Fragiles to farm 5 stars, but save them for days when I decide to level up a character's talents. That way I can manage to farm all the necessary talent books in the same day. Feels like a better investment to me due to the guaranteed returns, but mathematically it makes no difference.",
        "Nice. I enjoy the grind. AR49 at the moment. I finish my dailies and just roam and forage for an hour or so. Farm ascendancy materials for team 2 for Spiral Sbyss. But I find great joy in min-maxing everybody, so that keeps me busy.",
