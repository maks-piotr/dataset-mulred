        "Those 11 armed men were PLA-M (people's liberation army Manipur-meitei) a separatist meitei militant group. They carried out many ambushes against our Indian army which took the lives of many and injured several others.  A few years back they bombed an army Colonel entourage which took the lives of the colonel, his wife, his kid and several other Central forces",
