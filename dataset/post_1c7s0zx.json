    "selftext": "6 years back my parents joined a spiritual meditation group called ‚ÄúSahaj Marg‚Äù. Which is not called ‚ÄúHeartfulness‚Äù.\n\nInitially I was skeptical about this group but didn‚Äôt stopped them because they are not asking for money and focus on meditations. I thought what could go wrong with meditation.\n\nLater covid happened, and one day my parents watching a video of master called [‚ÄúDaa ji‚Äù (Kamlesh D. Patel)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamlesh_Patel_(Daaji)). He was speaking in English and telling his devotees to cure covid by [‚ÄúNeti kriya‚Äù](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_(Hatha_Yoga))\n\nI told my parents to stop listening to this man, this is BS. They ignored me.\n\nFortunately next news papar debunked this myth of Neti, and told people to stop believing it. Then they somewhat listened me.\n\nIn 2022-23 a girl on kbc comes and told on national television that she can see blindfolded which is thought by ‚ÄúHeartfulness‚Äù subgroup ‚ÄúBrighter Minds‚Äù. Everyone mesmerised by the demonstration on KBC. \n\nI called this BS again and told them it is already exposed on stage by ([Narendra Nayak)(President of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Nayak)Later that episode were withdrawn from most place even sony apologised for airing it.\n\nFew months later my father told me that it is not a scam and he have seen it live. Now his whole devotee group is going to promote it in local school and make them join it.\n\nI told him stop doing this you got scammed and now you are scamming people. But we had heated conversation he told me you wont understand this is a spiritual thing. Even knowing I am the most educated person in the family.\n\nRecently one of my loving relative also put his son in this blindfolded reading program by ‚ÄúBrighterMinds‚Äù, my father now pushing my niece into this.\n",

Initially I was skeptical about this group but didn‚Äôt stopped them because they are not asking for money and focus on meditations. I thought what could go wrong with meditation. Later covid happened, and one day my parents watching a video of master called [‚ÄúDaa ji‚Äù (Kamlesh D. Patel)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamlesh_Patel_(Daaji)). He was speaking in English and telling his devotees to cure covid by [‚ÄúNeti kriya‚Äù](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neti_(Hatha_Yoga)) I told my parents to stop listening to this man, this is BS. They ignored me. Fortunately next news papar debunked this myth of Neti, and told people to stop believing it. Then they somewhat listened me. In 2022-23 a girl on kbc comes and told on national television that she can see blindfolded which is thought by ‚ÄúHeartfulness‚Äù subgroup ‚ÄúBrighter Minds‚Äù. Everyone mesmerised by the demonstration on KBC. I called this BS again and told them it is already exposed on stage by ([Narendra Nayak)(President of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Nayak)Later that episode were withdrawn from most place even sony apologised for airing it. Few months later my father told me that it is not a scam and he have seen it live. Now his whole devotee group is going to promote it in local school and make them join it. I told him stop doing this you got scammed and now you are scamming people. But we had heated conversation he told me you wont understand this is a spiritual thing. Even knowing I am the most educated person in the family. Recently one of my loving relative also put his son in this blindfolded reading program by ‚ÄúBrighterMinds‚Äù, my father now pushing my niece into this.",

I am always surprised by how gullible the human brain is and how such groups/cults indoctrinate people beyond dissent. I am really sorry OP that you‚Äôve been going through this. I feel like your parents are a victim here too. I hope you find a way to save your niece from it and your parents as well. I wish you compassion and patience. anything that is a gift to human kind becomes a big corporate business scam. Really? I've been to their meditation centre in Hyderabad(Kasha Shanti Vanam). Stayed there for a week. Did not feel like a scam to me. It was actually very peaceful. Ask them to read something by smelling invisible ink xD As I told you ‚ÄúBrighter Minds‚Äú is sub group of ‚ÄúHeartfulness‚Äù that do this scam for money. They smartly make a different entity for this to keep main group name clear from it. They really do meditation which may not be scam. But their meditation have strict rules that is preached via WhatsApp and YouTube. All devotee do these meditation when WhatsApp group tell them to do in their home simultaneously just like robots. It feels more like cult than a meditation group. Unfortunately I won‚Äôt be able to save my niece. But if somehow we can write about this scam in Wikipedia page of ‚ÄúKamlesh‚Äù and ‚ÄúSahaj Marg / Heautfulness/Brighterminds‚Äù I think thousands of kids and parents can be saved. Apply parental controls on your parents' electronic devices. I can‚Äôt reach these kids otherwise I could have already exposed them. Soon I will get a chance to meet my relative‚Äôs kid . Too late for this, they have huge group of devotee who meet each twice a week. Watch videos on YouTube and get commands on WhatsApp groups. They are beyond retrieval. Try to ensure you have control of how they spend their money -- coz next they will start giving big donations. I think India is too religious to be spiritual I am so sorry for your loss. I know how this goes you are embarrassed, you start talking to your parents less and less and you will distance yourself and when they realise they have lost their child they will either blame you or worse your partner in future saying you have changed because of her. At this point if you are financially independent just support them as much as you can but live your own life happily independently and separately, it's a lost cause. Yes same goes education system Add yourself and multiple other people and start reporting the group from all over the place Sony did air it though Forget the funding if this was actually a scam why would sony even entertain them ? Omg, my grandparents joined this organisation in the 70s > Spirituality is gift to human kind Like a placebo effect? Sahaj Marg has a literal city, called Kanha where celebrities like PV Sindhu turn up. Their celebrity list is huge, this Kamlesh guy even got ‚ÄúPadama Bhushan‚Äù. It's hard to prove a scam. You can debunk a approach but they can go ahead with, there are many other ways we teach and what not. Unless you are legally convicted, everything is legal what u have done. I hope your grand parents stick to meditation part only. Religion/Spirituality is a BIG SCAM in India. Make fun of them, embarrass them whenever they bring up this shit. Be very cruel about it, they will get over it. Older people are usually set it their ways from years of subtle indoctrination and rationality only works if they have a thinking brain to begin with. Shame is a good motivator for the people without thinking brains. I am already very cruel about it. This is why me and my father goes into heated conversation Multiple times. But most relatives of mine are gullible religious people, they will rather believe him than me. Why? What did they need any funding for? Watch the episode I had a classmate who could identify any color just by touching it. He learnt it from these mid brain activation classes. Guys, this kinda stuff is real imo. Even my family believes in sahaj Marg. I hope they haven't tried to financially scam your family. Please do tell us if they ever tried to financially scam your family so that I will keep a closer look at my family spending over there (my family has been following them for the past 25 years and we were never forced to give any money). BTW our family experience has been good with sahaj marg they meditate in there aashram. I agree that their smell reading is some kind of little scam trick. Otherwise they are a good spiritual organisation which teaches people to meditate and other things. This organisation is much better than Sadhguru's and other spiritual organisations. People have a primal need to to \"Belong\" to group, tribe etc. The religious nature of Indian society makes spiritual cults with miraculous claims easy to attract common folks. It will very difficult to get away from this cult . He has been sufficiently brainwashed so unless he gets into something else ,this is here to stay. Put your foot down you see financial loss happening. Seems like inspired from plot of lucy movie Currently they donate 500-1000 max sometimes. I can‚Äôt know their cash transactions. Even if I know can‚Äôt stop them to donate. My father is retired 5 years back so it gives them too much time for such things. If it makes your parents happy and the group isn‚Äôt taking money from your parents, drop the issue. You can‚Äôt force people to have a scientific temperament. Afaik they don‚Äôt ask for money, but people joined start giving sooner or later. Their meditation part is okey but pseudoscience and scam parts are not. I agree with this part - that let them stay happy with this group. But scamming other parents and kids is totally wrong, I don‚Äôt want my parents to become scammers. Nope its just a trick, just like magicians do trick. Search ‚ÄúMidbrain activation scam‚Äù on YouTube and you will find how they do it. Can‚Äôt control their spending they are not that old. They just entered in 60s Oh man, whatever u said already happening. Thanks god they don‚Äôt blame my spouse for it. Because they know I was always not a religious person. I am financially fully independent. I miss old them. Too communal* to be spiritual as someone studying totally from youtube and ed tech since past two years, i agree. Could you not just describe in a line or two? I don't watch TV. You get receipts after donation. That scam is so successful because it makes kids lie for you. The kids are under so much peer pressure to smell the colors, they peak and lie. These things fuck up young minds. Smh Exactly üëçüèº they put pressure in kids to read blindfolded. They show them ‚Äúsee others can do it why can‚Äôt you.‚Äù Then they deliberately make such blindfolds which allow them to peek. This crap smelling thing also made it to shark tank india and did not get called out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwggmQVqwhE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwggmQVqwhE) Damn, my mom's family is pretty big in this. They joined way back in the 80s. Its crazy how totally involved people get in this. I mean as a kind of support group its great.. But when people get too involved in this is when it gets dangerous. You need to have a Balance in life. Why don't they learn it first? Tell your dad to read blindfolded and ask why he can't do it. How tf are \"schools\" even allowing this BS, are the teachers and principal retarded? Hey bhagwaaaaaaaan! This is the same group in which my maasi, her 2 kids, and daughter-in-law are all certified preceptors. Meri maasi ki family mein saaare log are members of it. OP, this post got me like ü§Øü§Øü§Ø These kinds of organisations are genuinely just prey the week minded,I remember watching one malayalm movie called \"trance\" Fahad was the actor n that's how I got to know some of these \"religious organisations\" really just are a money making buisness,some might really help,but there are many which just prey on weak n simple minded people,it's modern day scam but in the name of religion n god,n current environment doesn't help when everyone is on the edge with this. It's actually a vicious cycle somewhat like mlm that is like I did it n I lost it so I have to earn back a little bit,so let's connect others as well. The sad part is I don't think u can help much,they are adults n u can't do much other than talking about itüòÖn making others in your family members to understand is even harder coz then they will say \"Ghar walo to involve hai,to hme a \"lecture\" derhe?\" It's so hard to make sense to brain washed people,with this incident I remembered another incident which happened in reditt only,where a boy was talking about how his parents got involved in one such organisation and they are truly devoted to this and are planning to donate their money to them,I mean BIG money,and house if I am not wrong,this guy was freaking out,about what to do next? Like how can he prevent it from happening...and I remember thinking what can even anybody do with this,like they are adults you genuinely cant do muchü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rohit Sharma. And also previous President Ramnath Kovid. Actually as claimed by some very long term devotee, ‚Äúsahaj marg‚Äù used to be real good. No pseudoscience no scams. Their initial master were good and very restricted about keeping in apart from religion and cult. But when this Kamlesh guy becomes successor of it he made it more like cult and promote pseudoscience/ scams. He started pushing political interest within organisation. Some old devotee didn‚Äôt wanted this to happen and leaved it after 30+ years involvement. Even teachers lacks critical thinking. Critical thinking in India is very rare outside reddit. They don‚Äôt teach it to anyone older than 15+ years in fear of getting exposed using lame excuses. Don‚Äôt try to correct them, you will lose your relationship with them. Btw not every devotee involved in this scam, some goes and only meditate. Part of this organisation is scam and promote pseudoscience. Aap sahi keh rhe hain. I am very attached to my maasi and her family as they supported me a lot in my disputes with my parents. AFAWIH, they joined this Mission because my mausa had a really horrible drug and alcohol addiction who was very violent and abusive towards my maasi who got married to him as soon as she completed school. Bahut saal ho gye, mausa k nashe ki aadat chhoot gyi, bass zarda khaata hai and kitaabein padhta rhta hai. I too underwent few meditation sessions, and it was amazing. Bass main regular nhi reh paati. I am quite neutral in matters like these, especially because my maasi and her family are able to keep a balance Keep it in balance, some very long term devotee claims that before this Kamlesh guy started leading as successor. There were pure meditation nothing else. No pseudoscience no scams. This guys ruined this organisation now it becoming like cult. Sounds like Herbalife Been trying to stop my relatives from using their crappy products Chari ji aka P. Rajagopalchari majorly Sahaj Marg achieve krna meditation se wale point p zor dete thhe. AFAIK, Daaji is a PhD in Pharmacy. Shayad usi wajah se wo itna dimaag chala rhe hain pseudoscience ghused kr Yes right, Old devotees exactly said this . Its insane to me that someone as educated as principal allows bs like that, but then again there was that video today of a principal getting a \"facial\" instead of teaching during her shift, and literally biting the other teacher like a dog. Kudos to the other teacher for exposing that bitch. Didn't read the whole thing but read the last paragraph. This mind-brain activation thing came to my school like 8 years back. I think I was in 7th class. I know all this is fake, but I swear at the time it seemed to work. They did some session which I don't remember. Then they made us blindfold and then gave us some coloured balls. They were all identical except colour. We had to touch and smell them and tell their colour. And I don't know how but I could tell it correctly most of the time. Are you able to repeat this magic with any other object or just they gave it to you? Do you remember peeking and each balls smelling different? I didn't try with anything else. And as I said the balls were identical. Also, I'm not saying it worked for everyone. It worked for some and not for others, but it worked for me. I didn't peek. Thinking more about the \"session\", I remember they made us lie down, close our eyes and listen to some soothing sounds they played. My parents and whole lot is in this group, I personally studied in the school started by them. they started with meditation and recently only i am hearing all the other stuff that has started. Tbh meditation they teach is awesome, although i am not an active practitioner i meditate when i feel the need of it Okay, I know Brighter Minds and they don‚Äôt teach you to smell words. People tried to claim fame by citing this group or course. Sahaj Marg or Heartfulness has nothing to do with these people lying. I remember the Jal Neeti suggestion from Kamlesh Patel, but he clearly called out this will clear your congestion and let you breathe better. It‚Äôs a normal yoga practice. It‚Äôs like someone saying you should exercise daily vs understanding that they said walking will cure Covid. Do This! There is a you tuber who was exposing the daaji scam until Heartfulness started copyrighting him for everything. He still talks about it quite a bit. Gratefulness Meditation Apocalaughs Now and his other channel is Pockets of the future. Here is a link to his latest video. He has been a follower of Sahaj Marg for like 30 years but sees right thru the Heartfulness SCAM. Daaji is a POS My brother has learnt brighter mind, and he can read any book blindfolded you provide, any text on phone or image, he can exactly tell what you are thinking and even what colour of inner wears you are wearing inside. It is definitely not a scam. Don't get fooled try to make him read in completing dark room. Even i can read blindfolded as I tried multiple times as I can see from gaps. > he can exactly tell what you are thinking and even what colour of inner wears you are wearing inside. If this is true why dont you claim 5 lakh price that Narendra_Nayak is giving away for passing his test it is easy money for you. I have experimented in all the ways. He can read even from behind his back, dark room. Google him. This post has 1% of entire organisation what heartfulness does.... U have no idea What this organisation does...... they cater to the right wing group, and a good political background is also supporting it."
