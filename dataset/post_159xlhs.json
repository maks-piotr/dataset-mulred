    "selftext": "Saw , a recent post mentioning why no one protests against govt? The reality is govt can misuse draconian laws and person life will be ruined. **In 2019 , Bjp govt made amendments to UAPA and made it much more draconian . As per the 2019 amendment, the power of government to proscribe terrorist organization is now extended to individuals, i.e. the government can name individuals and label them as terrorist on the basis of suspicion, without following any due process or trial.**\n\n**The BJP made this amendment in 2019 and bill was passed by voice vote.**\n\n[https://lawwire.in/an-analysis-of-unlawful-activities-prevention-amendment-act-2019-through-the-prism-of-constitutional-values/](https://lawwire.in/an-analysis-of-unlawful-activities-prevention-amendment-act-2019-through-the-prism-of-constitutional-values/)\n\n**Why is UAPA draconian? Everyone must know about it and read the points**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Section 15 of the Act, defines the term **Terrorist Act**. However, it is seen that the definition provided in UAPA is substantially different from that being used and promoted by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism.  UAPA does not provide for any such measure or safeguard against potential abuse, which given the history of this legislation is necessary.\n* As per the UN Special Rapporteur on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the definition of 'Terrorist Act' focuses on three elements; use of deadly means, with an intent to create fear in the mass or with the intent of compelling government or International organisation to do or refrain from doing certain thing with an aim for promoting an ideology.\n* **On the other hand, UAPA covers a broader spectrum creating ambiguities by including death or injuries to any person, damage to any property, etc.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **It also includes any act that is \"likely to threaten\" or \"likely to strike terror in people,\" granting the government unrestricted authority to label any ordinary citizen or activist a terrorist without the commission of these acts or actually committing them.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Section 43(D)(5), 'Denial of Bail'  (must read) -** This is the most problematic provision of the Act, as this prevents the release of an accused on Bail, if once the chargesheet has been filed by the police, then it is impossible to get bail.  **The court will only look at chargesheet and not analyze any evidences or circumstances. This is known as \"prima facie\". This means For the grant of bail, it only looks at the plausibility of one side’s evidence — that is, the Prosecution’s. It binds the court to look at only the case diary or the police report, which has not been challenged by cross-examination . It forces the court to make an effective determination of guilt or innocence based on one side’s unchallenged story. It is virtually impossible to get bail**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Police can keep in jail for 180 days without filing any chargesheet . It allows the police to detain an accused for six months at a stretch without producing any evidence against the accused..** **Nearly 75% cases have no charge sheet filed . Also , UAPA follows \"guilty until innocent \"principle. The burden of providing proof of innocence lies on accused.**\n\n[https://www.legalserviceindia.com/legal/article-7517-uapa-a-draconian-law-dire-need-to-revisit-the-legislation.html](https://www.legalserviceindia.com/legal/article-7517-uapa-a-draconian-law-dire-need-to-revisit-the-legislation.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/mumbai/story/two-men-acquitted-uapa-charges-tajola-jail-navi-mumbai-1816255-2021-06-17](https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/mumbai/story/two-men-acquitted-uapa-charges-tajola-jail-navi-mumbai-1816255-2021-06-17) **( jailed under UAPA and released after 9 years in jail.  Indian court acknowledged they were wrongly jailed )**\n\n[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/22-of-cases-registered-under-the-uapa-from-2016-2019-ended-in-court-conviction/article61752993.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/22-of-cases-registered-under-the-uapa-from-2016-2019-ended-in-court-conviction/article61752993.ece) **( Only 2.2 % of cases registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act between the years 2016-2019 ended in convictions by court, according to data presented by the Union Home Ministry in the Rajya Sabha. This means less than 3%)**\n\n**Police has used this draconian law against activists, students, journalist. Only farmers escaped from this law, because bjp didnt want to anger rural population.**\n\nThis is why people are scared to protest. Also , there are other draconian laws like NSA ( used against siddique kappan and other journalist) and sedition law ( this law has been declared unconstitutional in pakistan and UK , but still applies to India. govt doesnt want to repeal it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

The UAPA has indeed been criticized for its draconian provisions, allowing the government to misuse its power and potentially ruin innocent lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 2019 amendment that extended the government's authority to label individuals as terrorists without due process is especially concerning. This undermines fundamental human rights and creates ambiguity in the definition of a \"Terrorist Act.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSection 43(D)(5) further complicates matters, denying bail to accused persons based solely on the prosecution's evidence without considering any counterarguments. This provision goes against the principle of \"innocent until proven guilty\" and makes it virtually impossible for individuals to obtain bail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe prolonged detention without filing chargesheets, and the burden of proving innocence falling on the accused, has led to severe injustices. It is alarming to see how this law has been used against activists, students, and journalists, affecting their freedom and inhibiting their right to protest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe low conviction rate under the UAPA raises serious questions about the law's effectiveness and fairness. People are indeed scared to protest due to the potential consequences under this draconian legislation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe must address these issues and reevaluate the UAPA to ensure that it aligns with principles of justice, human rights, and democracy.

        "Most detainees are jailed for about 4 years on average, without trial or bail, if no evidence could be found. And much longer otherwise. This is the crucial part of the law.\n\nWe could see how the law works in the comically flawed Bhima-Koregaon case. The older detainees died, the disabled detainees suffered without basic amenities, and the rest got bail after many years of imprisonment. Practically all were senior citizens from highly respectable backgrounds, and they had access to good lawyers. The trial will continue for decades.\n\nThe people want laws like this. They vote for this. They applaud every encounter, though they know what is happening. If you know the 2019 Hyderabad rape case encounter or the film \"Jai Bhim\", you will understand that police were just following protocol. They have a ready list of poor people they can shoot/imprison to please the politicians and the public. Justice and human rights are not the hot topics of election campaigns - crime reduction is.",

        "I wish I could agree with you.\n\nbut at the risk of downvotes, here's why I disagree with your thesis:\n\n1. Preventive detention laws and broadly read anti-terror laws have a long history in India. The first of these, IIRC, was the Rowlatt act (the same one that led to Jallianwala bagh). so there's something about governments in India that make them want to have a law that punishes thoughtcrime. That aspect isn't the BJP's sole province, it seems to be a fact of life.\n2. The problem that led to the UAPA being used the way it is, is the failure of laws like POTA and TADA and MISA to stand up to judicial scrutiny. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I think UAPA was meant to be an omnibus anti-organized crime act (similar to MCOCA or goondas acts in various states); but when the courts struck down POTA, the state (at that time UPA, but could've been anyone, see 1 above) decided to put POTA provisions into UAPA. that is the original sin, IMO\n3. the designation of individuals as terrorists is again something that's very easy to abuse (and has been in the examples you cite), but it's hard to see how you'd not need provisions similar to these, in today's world of internet-connected terrorists, who don't need to meet in one place or profess to a common cause in front of witnesses, to conspire together. \n4. the most important thing - UAPA doesn't seem to be the primary method the government is using to suppress dissent. There's no pattern that I can discern as to who gets hit with UAPA, vs the ED or the CBI or other attacks. I tend to believe that there's no central puppetmaster, but that it's bigoted and entitled investigating officers on the ground who decide to \"fix\" opponents, and use provisions of the law that are available to them. \n5. I don't think the opposition gets to use the presence of UAPA as an out. No political opposition has been targeted using UAPA. and while the terror charges seem to be specious, it seems reasonably clear that all the UAPA accused have had proximity (may be legitimate, maybe just sympathy) with proscribed organizations. I don't think they would deny it even. eg Anand Teltumbe, Ferreira and Kpobad Gandhi with the CPI(Maoist); Siddique Kappan with PFI. **I AM NOT saying that they deserve to have been jailed.** just that the opposition may claim that they're being victimised using UAPA, but that just wouldn't be true.",
        "How to use ChatGPT to farm karma.",
        "1. While the appeal of having preventative laws are understandable. Globally these kinds of laws have a horrible track record of being abused. The real underlying question is about how useful these laws actually are. A naive perspective would be that since only 2.2% of the cases are found to have convictions, we could come to a conclusion that the law is virtually useless to the law enforcement agencies. Secondly, a deeper dive into circumstances, analysis of time criticality of the convicted cases would tell us whether or not these types of preventive laws are even necessary given the realities of law enforcement.\n2. Could you please expand on this. Are you saying that the absence of laws like POTA is the reason we should have UAPA ?\n3. I’m not sure how this point factors into your argument. Yes in an internet connected world anyone can be a terrorist. But even in these scenarios, one would need evidence to come to the conclusion that they are a terrorist. If the suspicion does not arise out of investigation, legitimate means of surveillance (one with checks and balances), it becomes an avenue for exploitation.\n4. Fair enough, but the general applicability of the UAPA and it’s terror potential against corruption cannot be discounted because it’s the least used tool.\n5. I agree with you but as far I can see, this makes a weak argument to retain UAPA.\n\nGlobally these kinds of omnibus terror laws are created as a response to fear. I think that is the problem with these kinds of laws, they are created for the wrong reasons. While all of the points that I could understand are valid, I don’t they sufficiently dilute the OP’s arguments.",

This means For the grant of bail, it only looks at the plausibility of one side’s evidence — that is, the Prosecution’s.\n\nI love how these laws are always written in such a way as to pretend that judicial and legal corruption isn’t actually a widespread problem, lol.",
        ">We could see how the law works in the comically flawed Bhima-Koregaon case.\n\n“Comically flawed” is a good way to describe the entire case, yeah. \n\nSo far as I’m aware, at least several reviews have confirmed that the digital evidence underlying the UAPA charges was planted on the accused parties’ computers post-arrest by the Pune Police Department. \n\nIt isn’t even very compelling evidence, either. The police are asking that rational adults—prosecutors, judges, and the public—believe that a group of dedicated, experienced “Naxalites” shared documents referring to each other by their full, legal names while conspiring to kill the prime minister of India. \n\nYou could’ve asked an undergraduate English student to come up with a more convincing plot.",
        "I do agree with the poor track record, i was just saying that these seem to be zombie legislations that have a looong afterlife. Kill one, and another one raises its ugly head. \n\nI am not saying we should have uapa. I'm saying that putting pota provisions into uapa seems like a bad compromise. Except that the sc seems to be ok with this. We would maybe have done better with another terror law that was purpose-built, and written to pass judicial review. Rather than introduce the same vagueness into both.\n\nRe surveillance etc, I'm not aware of how much power law enforcement has in these matters (probably a lot). But i don't know how custodial interrogation would be denied. Especially given how weak our investigation abilities are. We've failed completely to find checks and balances, or strict oversight over warrants in these matters. That seems to be as much of the problem as the vaguely written law. \n\nThe fact that it _is_ the least used is relevant, surely? And that's the only way to discount it. \n\nThere is no argument to retain uapa. \n\nBut op's overall argument is that this is why there's no dissent. To me, this is a cop out by the opposition. If you think that your opponent is a dictator, it apparently excuses you from taking political action as you would in a democracy. That seems absurd to me.",
        "I can draw opposite conclusions from your own explanations.\n\nTADA-type laws are a problem because they are not really within normal judicial oversight and safeguards. This should be the whole of our argument against them. The courts cannot declare such laws unconstitutional, which is why we should hope that a more liberal government repeals them. Indeed, all parties like such laws when they are in power because their popularity depends on the appearance of shutting down crime. Besides this, BJP misuses this law in a specific way, as I point next.\n\nThe BJP never tried to jail dissidents, or take away the rights of citizens. (Clearly, we freely abuse Modi without consequence.) Rather, they act in a subtle and selective way, so that the more inconvenient and influential voices are punished and made an example of. That may be through the ED/CBI route, or through the application of UAPA/NSA. You point out that the victims have some \"proximity\" to banned organizations. But this is just a way of saying leftists and Muslims (the two dissident groups against the BJP) should be exposed to being linked to such organizations and shut away for life. None of the Bhima-Koregaon accused - including Anand Teltumblde - have links to CPI (Maoist), though that is the highly fanciful charge against them. You can also see that any politically-active Kashmiri is quickly arrested as a terrorist, when in reality, freedom of expression is meaningful only when given to inconvenient people.\n\nYou suggest TADA-type laws are required to track down terrorists. Governments instil fear to take away freedom. Even the freedom conscious Americans surrendered all their rights under the Patriot act and FISA, under the fear and anger of 9/11. We didn't need Snowden to tell us - it is right there in the laws. The American government could do warrantless surveillance, and no court turns down a FISA warrant. Technology has advanced by leaps and bounds since then. Rahul Gandhi has said with respect to the government's use of Pegasus, \"I presume my phone is being tapped.\"",

I am not, i think they should go. \n\nBut a, i am trying to understand why they are a standing feature of our governance, irrespective of who is in power. Which makes me believe that no, a more liberal government isn't going to repeal uapa very easily. So the best we can hope for is a better law that allows for some oversight and checks over sweeping powers. \n\nB, if a law is on the books it will be used. Apparently in India at least, it will be abused. In my opinion, the move to designate individuals as terrorists was inevitable given the times we live in. The abuse of those provisions to jail dissidents is also inevitable. Sorry if that sounds cynical. If uapa goes, the next law will probably do the same thing. \n\nC, I've said this again in a comment below: but concern a and b, I am saying that uapa isn't used all that often. It's used quite specifically against certain individuals. To compare uapa with the prevention of corruption act or the pmla isn't the same. So no, the mainstream opposition ought not to claim victimisation in the same sort of way.",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Saw , a recent post mentioning why no one protests against govt? The reality is govt can misuse draconian laws and person life will be ruined. **In 2019 , Bjp govt made amendments to UAPA and made it much more draconian . As per the 2019 amendment, the power of government to proscribe terrorist organization is now extended to individuals, i.e. the government can name individuals and label them as terrorist on the basis of suspicion, without following any due process or trial.** **The BJP made this amendment in 2019 and bill was passed by voice vote.** [https://lawwire.in/an-analysis-of-unlawful-activities-prevention-amendment-act-2019-through-the-prism-of-constitutional-values/](https://lawwire.in/an-analysis-of-unlawful-activities-prevention-amendment-act-2019-through-the-prism-of-constitutional-values/) **Why is UAPA draconian? Everyone must know about it and read the points** &#x200B; * Section 15 of the Act, defines the term **Terrorist Act**. However, it is seen that the definition provided in UAPA is substantially different from that being used and promoted by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism. UAPA does not provide for any such measure or safeguard against potential abuse, which given the history of this legislation is necessary. * As per the UN Special Rapporteur on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the definition of 'Terrorist Act' focuses on three elements; use of deadly means, with an intent to create fear in the mass or with the intent of compelling government or International organisation to do or refrain from doing certain thing with an aim for promoting an ideology. * **On the other hand, UAPA covers a broader spectrum creating ambiguities by including death or injuries to any person, damage to any property, etc.** &#x200B; * **It also includes any act that is \"likely to threaten\" or \"likely to strike terror in people,\" granting the government unrestricted authority to label any ordinary citizen or activist a terrorist without the commission of these acts or actually committing them.** &#x200B; * **Section 43(D)(5), 'Denial of Bail' (must read) -** This is the most problematic provision of the Act, as this prevents the release of an accused on Bail, if once the chargesheet has been filed by the police, then it is impossible to get bail. **The court will only look at chargesheet and not analyze any evidences or circumstances. This is known as \"prima facie\". This means For the grant of bail, it only looks at the plausibility of one side’s evidence — that is, the Prosecution’s. It binds the court to look at only the case diary or the police report, which has not been challenged by cross-examination . It forces the court to make an effective determination of guilt or innocence based on one side’s unchallenged story. It is virtually impossible to get bail** &#x200B; * **Police can keep in jail for 180 days without filing any chargesheet . It allows the police to detain an accused for six months at a stretch without producing any evidence against the accused..** **Nearly 75% cases have no charge sheet filed .

He is close to modi. UAPA is never invoked against people like yati narsginghanand who gave calls for genocide. From what I’ve read the 10k long NIA chargesheet revealed he mobilized funding, leadership and intellectual support to maoists and was also instrumental to the think tank of CPI(M) which is a banned Naxalite org. \"Bring Dalit & Muslim forces together all over with militant section of ppl being organised\", says his letter seized by NIA. If people are unhappy with the govt, there are ways to practice democracy. But if you are discussing guerilla techniques to deal with govt, you are constructing a road towards the prison. Do NOT expect leniency from security agencies in such extremely sensitive matters of internal security. You shouldn’t respond to/argue with Chaddis. You ignore them or report them if they break the rules. I will tell you one example. Nihang Singhs defend Dasam Granth fiercely. Scholars say it is a combination of Guru Gobind Singh Ji's own writing, court poets, and translation of Sanskrit granths so that ordinary people can access and understand what pandits thought about them. in 2010, one Nihang, Purshottam Singh, was involved in one such debate. He was picked up under UAPA and Police branded him a Babbar Khalsa terrorist. Court acquitted him fully in 2014. But all the websites and statistic collectors had already branded and done scare mongering. Funny thing, come 2023 this Purshottam Singh is dining with RSS guys... I have freedom of expression,right to criticize gov. Bjp-not any more I have right to vote Bjp after 1-2 year -not any more chargesheet is not evidence. I mentioned in the post that chargesheet is not cross examined . This means they can claim they got some information but it wont be cross examined. It is treated as \"prima facie\".

What does this say about the agency? It's literally the Rowlatt act which was during the British India. What crimes did they commit to deserve to be imprisoned for years without trial, according to you? Having draconian laws like sedition and UAPA does not befit a democracy This law is For helping the BJP. Master stroke law. Na rahega baans na bajegi bansuri You've brought up some critical points about the UAPA, and I completely understand your concerns. The UAPA has indeed been criticized for its draconian provisions, allowing the government to misuse its power and potentially ruin innocent lives. &#x200B; The 2019 amendment that extended the government's authority to label individuals as terrorists without due process is especially concerning. This undermines fundamental human rights and creates ambiguity in the definition of a \"Terrorist Act.\" &#x200B; Section 43(D)(5) further complicates matters, denying bail to accused persons based solely on the prosecution's evidence without considering any counterarguments. This provision goes against the principle of \"innocent until proven guilty\" and makes it virtually impossible for individuals to obtain bail. &#x200B; The prolonged detention without filing chargesheets, and the burden of proving innocence falling on the accused, has led to severe injustices. It is alarming to see how this law has been used against activists, students, and journalists, affecting their freedom and inhibiting their right to protest. &#x200B; The low conviction rate under the UAPA raises serious questions about the law's effectiveness and fairness. People are indeed scared to protest due to the potential consequences under this draconian legislation. &#x200B; We must address these issues and reevaluate the UAPA to ensure that it aligns with principles of justice, human rights, and democracy. Additionally, other laws like the NSA and sedition law should also be reviewed to safeguard citizens' rights and promote a more transparent and just society. Most detainees are jailed for about 4 years on average, without trial or bail, if no evidence could be found. And much longer otherwise. This is the crucial part of the law. We could see how the law works in the comically flawed Bhima-Koregaon case. The older detainees died, the disabled detainees suffered without basic amenities, and the rest got bail after many years of imprisonment. Practically all were senior citizens from highly respectable backgrounds, and they had access to good lawyers. The trial will continue for decades. The people want laws like this. They vote for this. They applaud every encounter, though they know what is happening. If you know the 2019 Hyderabad rape case encounter or the film \"Jai Bhim\", you will understand that police were just following protocol. They have a ready list of poor people they can shoot/imprison to please the politicians and the public. Justice and human rights are not the hot topics of election campaigns - crime reduction is. Elect a bunch of thugs to power and where’s the surprise this is the shit they do? A fundamental legal principle in a civilized state is the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise. Apparently, that doesn't work in a \"CiViLizAtioNaL StATe\". Do you realise that Congress govt brought this law in the first place? Did you read the 3rd statement that mentions **BJP amended it to its current form**? No? Thought so. I wish I could agree with you. but at the risk of downvotes, here's why I disagree with your thesis: 1. Preventive detention laws and broadly read anti-terror laws have a long history in India. The first of these, IIRC, was the Rowlatt act (the same one that led to Jallianwala bagh). so there's something about governments in India that make them want to have a law that punishes thoughtcrime. That aspect isn't the BJP's sole province, it seems to be a fact of life. 2. The problem that led to the UAPA being used the way it is, is the failure of laws like POTA and TADA and MISA to stand up to judicial scrutiny. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I think UAPA was meant to be an omnibus anti-organized crime act (similar to MCOCA or goondas acts in various states); but when the courts struck down POTA, the state (at that time UPA, but could've been anyone, see 1 above) decided to put POTA provisions into UAPA. that is the original sin, IMO 3. the designation of individuals as terrorists is again something that's very easy to abuse (and has been in the examples you cite), but it's hard to see how you'd not need provisions similar to these, in today's world of internet-connected terrorists, who don't need to meet in one place or profess to a common cause in front of witnesses, to conspire together. 4. the most important thing - UAPA doesn't seem to be the primary method the government is using to suppress dissent. There's no pattern that I can discern as to who gets hit with UAPA, vs the ED or the CBI or other attacks. I tend to believe that there's no central puppetmaster, but that it's bigoted and entitled investigating officers on the ground who decide to \"fix\" opponents, and use provisions of the law that are available to them. 5. I don't think the opposition gets to use the presence of UAPA as an out. No political opposition has been targeted using UAPA. and while the terror charges seem to be specious, it seems reasonably clear that all the UAPA accused have had proximity (may be legitimate, maybe just sympathy) with proscribed organizations. I don't think they would deny it even. eg Anand Teltumbe, Ferreira and Kpobad Gandhi with the CPI(Maoist); Siddique Kappan with PFI. **I AM NOT saying that they deserve to have been jailed.** just that the opposition may claim that they're being victimised using UAPA, but that just wouldn't be true. How to use ChatGPT to farm karma. 1. While the appeal of having preventative laws are understandable. Globally these kinds of laws have a horrible track record of being abused. The real underlying question is about how useful these laws actually are. A naive perspective would be that since only 2.2% of the cases are found to have convictions, we could come to a conclusion that the law is virtually useless to the law enforcement agencies. Secondly, a deeper dive into circumstances, analysis of time criticality of the convicted cases would tell us whether or not these types of preventive laws are even necessary given the realities of law enforcement. 2. Could you please expand on this. Are you saying that the absence of laws like POTA is the reason we should have UAPA ? 3. I’m not sure how this point factors into your argument. Yes in an internet connected world anyone can be a terrorist. But even in these scenarios, one would need evidence to come to the conclusion that they are a terrorist. If the suspicion does not arise out of investigation, legitimate means of surveillance (one with checks and balances), it becomes an avenue for exploitation. 4. Fair enough, but the general applicability of the UAPA and it’s terror potential against corruption cannot be discounted because it’s the least used tool. 5. I agree with you but as far I can see, this makes a weak argument to retain UAPA. Globally these kinds of omnibus terror laws are created as a response to fear. I think that is the problem with these kinds of laws, they are created for the wrong reasons. While all of the points that I could understand are valid, I don’t they sufficiently dilute the OP’s arguments. >The court will only look at chargesheet and not analyze any evidences or circumstances. This is known as \"prima facie\". This means For the grant of bail, it only looks at the plausibility of one side’s evidence — that is, the Prosecution’s. I love how these laws are always written in such a way as to pretend that judicial and legal corruption isn’t actually a widespread problem, lol. >We could see how the law works in the comically flawed Bhima-Koregaon case. “Comically flawed” is a good way to describe the entire case, yeah. So far as I’m aware, at least several reviews have confirmed that the digital evidence underlying the UAPA charges was planted on the accused parties’ computers post-arrest by the Pune Police Department. It isn’t even very compelling evidence, either. The police are asking that rational adults—prosecutors, judges, and the public—believe that a group of dedicated, experienced “Naxalites” shared documents referring to each other by their full, legal names while conspiring to kill the prime minister of India. You could’ve asked an undergraduate English student to come up with a more convincing plot. I do agree with the poor track record, i was just saying that these seem to be zombie legislations that have a looong afterlife. Kill one, and another one raises its ugly head. I am not saying we should have uapa. I'm saying that putting pota provisions into uapa seems like a bad compromise. Except that the sc seems to be ok with this. We would maybe have done better with another terror law that was purpose-built, and written to pass judicial review. Rather than introduce the same vagueness into both. Re surveillance etc, I'm not aware of how much power law enforcement has in these matters (probably a lot). But i don't know how custodial interrogation would be denied. Especially given how weak our investigation abilities are. We've failed completely to find checks and balances, or strict oversight over warrants in these matters. That seems to be as much of the problem as the vaguely written law. The fact that it _is_ the least used is relevant, surely? And that's the only way to discount it. There is no argument to retain uapa. But op's overall argument is that this is why there's no dissent. To me, this is a cop out by the opposition. If you think that your opponent is a dictator, it apparently excuses you from taking political action as you would in a democracy. That seems absurd to me. I can draw opposite conclusions from your own explanations. TADA-type laws are a problem because they are not really within normal judicial oversight and safeguards. This should be the whole of our argument against them. The courts cannot declare such laws unconstitutional, which is why we should hope that a more liberal government repeals them. Indeed, all parties like such laws when they are in power because their popularity depends on the appearance of shutting down crime. Besides this, BJP misuses this law in a specific way, as I point next. The BJP never tried to jail dissidents, or take away the rights of citizens. (Clearly, we freely abuse Modi without consequence.) Rather, they act in a subtle and selective way, so that the more inconvenient and influential voices are punished and made an example of. That may be through the ED/CBI route, or through the application of UAPA/NSA. You point out that the victims have some \"proximity\" to banned organizations. But this is just a way of saying leftists and Muslims (the two dissident groups against the BJP) should be exposed to being linked to such organizations and shut away for life. None of the Bhima-Koregaon accused - including Anand Teltumblde - have links to CPI (Maoist), though that is the highly fanciful charge against them. You can also see that any politically-active Kashmiri is quickly arrested as a terrorist, when in reality, freedom of expression is meaningful only when given to inconvenient people. You suggest TADA-type laws are required to track down terrorists. Governments instil fear to take away freedom. Even the freedom conscious Americans surrendered all their rights under the Patriot act and FISA, under the fear and anger of 9/11. We didn't need Snowden to tell us - it is right there in the laws. The American government could do warrantless surveillance, and no court turns down a FISA warrant. Technology has advanced by leaps and bounds since then. Rahul Gandhi has said with respect to the government's use of Pegasus, \"I presume my phone is being tapped.\" Any law that allows detention without quick path to trial is draconian. We tend to associate it with British but it doesn’t mean that modern rulers have greater sense of judgment. Umar Khalid cough cough .... 🙃 Isn't the UAPA just another name for the Rowlatt act of 1919? The same act which drew the jalianwala baghitla massacre. Maybe we should start calling it with us original name. Sorry if it sounded like i was justifying tada/pota/uapa. I am not, i think they should go. But a, i am trying to understand why they are a standing feature of our governance, irrespective of who is in power. Which makes me believe that no, a more liberal government isn't going to repeal uapa very easily. So the best we can hope for is a better law that allows for some oversight and checks over sweeping powers. B, if a law is on the books it will be used. Apparently in India at least, it will be abused. In my opinion, the move to designate individuals as terrorists was inevitable given the times we live in. The abuse of those provisions to jail dissidents is also inevitable. Sorry if that sounds cynical. If uapa goes, the next law will probably do the same thing. C, I've said this again in a comment below: but concern a and b, I am saying that uapa isn't used all that often. It's used quite specifically against certain individuals. To compare uapa with the prevention of corruption act or the pmla isn't the same. So no, the mainstream opposition ought not to claim victimisation in the same sort of way. Same vague thing that hand wavingly becomes proximity. > The BJP made this amendment in 2019 and bill was passed by voice vote. What laws are being passed, without discussion/debate in current session, while the opposition is ~~distracted~~* busy pursuing the Manipur issue? * the timing of lifting the intrnet ban and allow release of the Manipur shame video is suspect."
