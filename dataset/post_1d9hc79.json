Yes Modi didn't lose as you wanted and maybe your vote didn't impact as much as you wanted but it did impact a lot and the loss is the proof of that where a dictator government couldn't be formed. I wish that you go and vote for all elections no matter how difficult cause even though it might seem that your vote does not matter, it does matter to people that can't vote and to people that are helpless to save themselves your vote has helped them and given them hope that maybe Modi can lose.

Poorer ones in villages and other places as well as protesting farmers who's voices have been suppressed but now since Modi didn't get majority those people have had a sigh of relief. These people will have in their hearts a gratefulness that might give them hope to live their lives and have a hope to escape oppression. Be sure to vote in the next elections for these people.
