Specifically enjoyed the class/religion/caste/gender commentaries and production quality. _Sherni_ was also pretty good, though less intense. I finally started Nichijou yesterday.

I really tried to get into this podcast with forcing myself to listen multiple episodes because I love Dan Carlin and Mike Duncan't podcasts, but I couldn't get past the background stereotypical sitar music, and cringy dialogues. I wish they would have kept it simple. watched this really weird anime called BATOOM! 5 episode in and idk how i feel, its entertaining though I recommend Barry And Mr In-between which share a lot of similarities with patriot. Google: Zeitgeist: The Movie (2007) YouTubers : \\&gt; Lemmino (would suggest starting with his DB Cooper video) \\&gt; Nexpo \\&gt; Barely Sociable \\&gt; Down the Rabbit hole (Fredrik Knudsen) \\&gt; Blameitonjorge \\&gt; Dark Matters \\&gt; ReignBot \\&gt; Kendall Rae TV Show: \\&gt; X-Files (Fiction) \\&gt; Project Blue Book (fiction) \\&gt; Mr. Robot (Fiction) \\&gt; The wire (fiction) \\&gt; Black Mirror (fiction) \\&gt; Mind Hunter (fiction) \\&gt; People Magazine Investigates (True Crime) \\&gt; Forensic Files (True Crime) Podcasts: \\&gt; Project Nova \\&gt; BBC Tracks \\&gt; Last podcast on the left \\&gt; Blood Culture \\&gt; Unexplained Mysteries (Parcast) Movies: \\&gt; The Zodiac \\&gt; Marathon Man \\&gt; The Adjustment Bureau \\&gt; The Parallax View \\&gt; Fight Club \\&gt; V for Vendetta \\&gt; Zeitgeist: The Movie \\&gt; The Truman Show And ofc, the best of them all, Infowars :) Where did you watch it. I couldn't find it on prime or netflix. anyone watching/watched Loki :) Themks üòöüòö &gt;!Gand Faad Dunga!&lt; Me üëΩ... The story's really good. Matribhumi I've just begun Boardwalk Empire, currently towards end of S1 and have found it a bit slow . I've enjoyed The Wire, Narcos and other crime based series so hoping the same for this. George likes his chicken spicy üî• It is slow paced but definitely worth it. S2 and S3 are excellent. Insidious is pretty interesting but only the first one after that I feel like it gets boring and repetitive Blackmirror se zyada emotionally disturbing aur kuch nahi Watched Raiders of the lost Ark again. Such a perfect movie! Most of today's action movies aren't half as engaging as Raiders Have seen Barry..will have to watch Mr inbetween.. thankss Have to say, the opening theme is pretty dope, this was my first battle royale'ish show in any medium when I watched it 5-6 years back, I enjoyed it a lot but sadly it never got adapted further I was on a roll watching Korean movies once Watched oldboy, I saw the devil, memories of the murder, few more I think don't remember the names though Stacked weekend I have to say I would suggest watching Asobi asobase Hinamatsuri As well, very fun 1 cour shows I've seen Asobi Asobase. I died laughing watching that as well. I've to check Hinamatsuri out. I'll do that soon. Thanks for the recommendation! :) I would suggest people to read Metamorphosis Warning, not for the faint of the heart though Nice You are welcome Your username suggests you must have already completed gintama minus the final movie TOSHIIII!! If you haven't read it already, I would suggest reading [Samsa falls in love](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/28/samsa-in-love), a short story written by Haruki Murakami and sort-of based on Metamorphosis but reverse where an insect becomes a human being.
