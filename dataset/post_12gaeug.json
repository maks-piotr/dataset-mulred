        "Hi, there's certainly a major safety issue for women around the country. However, I hope you'd agree that poor legal frameworks help nobody. Also, it takes away conventional protections from people in the LGBTQI+ folks in the country who are susceptible as the current laws strictly define men as perpetrators and women as victims.",
        "Because men are the perpetrators of the sexual assault and murder of men, women, children, LGBTQIA+ or animals 99.9999999 times. Most of the victims do not come forward because they know they will be accused of lying. What you're doing is uplifting the uplifted in India.  Anyone can lie in a testimony in any criminal case, there are already laws that punish you for lying in court. Why do want to give even more power to rapists. Why specifically go for rape victims when the number of real rape cases compared to false rape cases is infinitely more.",
        "I feel it is rather harsh to use the word \"rapists\" and \"men\" interchangeably. The case of silence in the aftermath of sexual assault is also applicable to female-on-male sexual crimes, and there's no way of us knowing the real numbers pertaining to the same cause the laws are stitched up in such a way that sexual crimes committed by women, in totality, cannot even be acknowledged from a legal purview. It helps nobody, people still get raped, nobody's better off with this \"us vs them\" mentality. Rape is about power, and power dynamics are not always dictated by gender, race etc. From one circumstance to another, people develop different hierarchies.",
        "Dude, touch some grass. Every woman in India has been harassed or assaulted by atleast one MAN. Every female foreingner has been harassed by atleast one MAN.
