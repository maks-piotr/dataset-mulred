Please solve my doubts I’ll be on the bandwagon to declare him guilty too.\n\n1. If you read the screenshot, it said- the situation got heated up and escalated. As a man with no other info, there are several ways this could have been said. Maybe if he raised his voice. Maybe if he, as alleged, raped. Maybe if he hit her. Maybe they were playing fifa and he took it personal. Maybe he cursed her. Maybe he said some personal things. Point being, this apology isn’t an evidence of rape. How do you, me or any third party deduce this to be rape?\n2. Even if the screenshot said I’m sorry I raped you, how do we check authenticity of the screenshot. I can make a screenshot like this in 5 minutes with your username stating you stole ₹10 lacs cash from my house and now I want my money back. Will you believe it?\n\nAs far as the case is concerned, I’m all about justice. If the girl had, rape, molestation or even being hit physically, I’m with her. I want to make this public. I want news media to cover this too. All power to the girl all my support to her. But I don’t know the two parties personally, so how can I convict the guy? Basis what?\n\nWe need a formal investigation. We need police involved. We need evidences. And if the guy is a culprit, I hope he rots in jail. F\\*ck, I’ll run him over with my car. But until we can’t say with evidence, why go after someone and their families?\n\nAnd regarding his personality and how this has been a repeated behaviour, let’s call that out. Let’s prove everything against him and make his life miserable. But until proven, we can’t ruin his and his family’s life.\n\nJust imagine if someone alleged something like this against you, and it was untrue but the media trial declared you guilty.\n\nMind you, I am in no way trying to protect that guy. But rather I’m taking a stance against media trials.",

A liar when telling a lie is usually accompanied by a dissonance of facts. In the first line it was twice and yet the very next sentence it becomes \"the man\", a clear dissonance of what you are thinking vs what you are writing. You can read this up, it is called the Reid interrogation technique\n>When I called them out, both of them looked angry and offended. If it happens again, I'll probably report to the cabin crew and will consider a police complaint. \n\nA person caught in an act of sexual conduct can be reported by anyone, not to mention a person caught doing something like this would be more scared than offended since offense on a person mostly/only comes from a clash of logic and reason. I doubt the men would get offended \"both times\". And I doubt a man masturbating on a plane would have not made news by now, TWICE. You are in no way  the only flier flying/sitting next to the supposed accused man. I am not telling that you may be lying, I am just saying it reeks a lot of it.\n\nBeing a victim of sexual grooming, people like you spewing lies just make our own battles and traumas laughable.",

That undermines it because it’s stated very broadly and on a false positive report.

This could be particularly likely if there were no public statements made against the doctor outside of the legal context. A defamation case hinges on proving that false statements were made publicly, causing harm to the doctor's reputation. If these elements are not present or cannot be adequately demonstrated, the doctor's case may not succeed.\n\nFurthermore, initiating a defamation suit could inadvertently escalate the situation. It might prompt the other side, presumably the minor and their representatives, to file a civil suit for compensation against the doctor. In such a civil case, as previously mentioned, the threshold for proof is lower than in criminal proceedings. This means that while the criminal case didn't meet the high standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt', a civil case requiring only a 'preponderance of evidence' could potentially be more problematic for the doctor.\n\nThis needs to be weighed carefully by the doctor's legal team. The doctor's action, intended to clear his name and seek redress for defamation, could ironically lead to him facing a civil lawsuit with a more favorable burden of proof for the plaintiff. This situation could expose the doctor to significant legal and financial risks.\n\nTherefore, while a defamation suit is legally feasible, it carries the risk of public perception issues and extracting an emotional toll on the doctor and his family, but also the possibility of not achieving the desired legal outcome and inadvertently opening up a new legal battleground.",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Source:",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Is specifying the origin necessary for every post ? 🤦 Yes it is very much important in this case. Were you not alive in 2022? Did you forget how much our own media and people sent death threats to him and his parents? I am happy that justice prevailed I can only imagine how he would have felt while being abused by people when he was innocent When an Indian-Origin does something great, news outlet be like: Indian achievement. When an Indian-Origin does something wrong, news outlet be like: calm down it’s Indian-Origin. He was cleared by the court did you even read that? Yep. The point is. Had it been news regarding the person becoming CEO the word origin would had been skipped conviniently. Idk man as far as I remember everytime I read articles about this they mentioned it as Indian origin only Either way a very weird thing to focus into Homie took the pill why the fu\\*k they put his photo Sounds like a case of racism and stereotyping, along with some wrong assumptions about what's happening on the airplane. Unfortunately, there are many people out there who just look at Indian men and think we are all perverts. New fear unlocked Because his identity is \"him\" Man. I hope this guy is compensated for what he would have gone through. I hate media trials. They declare the guilt with no evidences. A few days ago, on one of Indian subs, someone posted the name of 3 guys from Bombay (heetik shah and 2 more). The allegation of rape came from someone who made an insta account and uploaded a Snapchat screenshot of this guy saying sorry for the matter getting escalated. While I agree, that victim, if actually these things happened, would be in a traumatic state. And full support to her. But these people on reddit were calling out the guy’s insta handle, his parent’s names, his mother’s business name, asking people to go give them hate. I commented on that post that should we not ask for more evidence before declaring this guy guilty and going after him and his family. lol I was heavily downvoted, abused and ridiculed. Prob more to do with melanin content and senastional headline He should sue those assholes back for defamation Wait did he masturbate or did he not? how on earth can someone mistake something like this! Yes it means he did not More like \"He/Him\". Would've been different if it was \"Him/They\" Thank you. WHY THE FUCK DO WE HEAR A RA*E, SE*UAL ASSUAL OR SE*UAL HARRASMENT CASES INVOLVING INDIANS WITH THE CULPRIT COMING OUT NOT GUILTY !!!! > The prosecutors were disappointed with the case’s outcome. What are they on about? Why would they still be on his tail after he proven innocent? It's good that they are taking action for wrongdoing against minors ,but the lines \" Prosecutors felt disappointed with the outcome \" irks me. Stupid Americans and their weird obsession of everyone who is not a redneck should always be wrong No, it just means that the prosecution could not demonstrate to the satisfaction of a jury that he was guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. No one in this thread could say for certain what happened before the verdict, and that remains the case now. US courts are not in the business of declaring people innocent, which allows them to protect more innocent people from the criminal justice system. Western teens scare TF out of me. Not only do they act wayyy older than their age, they also pull disgusting little stunts like these and never get punished for it. How does one get the urge at such a random place to pull off somthing like this??? The purpose of uploading the case and culprits information is to spread awareness about the case to the people Racism and uhhhh land of phreedome Smells like racism radicalism of the teen to me 🤷🏻‍♂️ What on earth led to this misunderstanding in the first place! Like wtf?? Oh sorry my bad I did not see the link. So he was wrongly accused. It's the perfect combination. Young white girl in America. Virtually untouchable. Did you even read the news? After african-americans its the indian-americans on the queue. Some men do masturbate on planes, I am a frequent flyer and so far it happened to me twice (I am a woman) that the man sitting next to me was masturbating. When I called them out, both of them look angry and offended. They would've done the same for a white man Actually it's you that sound racist towards white Americans. bruh there has been so many anecdotes from women coming with how him and his friends do that a lot in bastian,public shaming is only how this gets reduced. there is evidence of him saying sorry and accepting it too and youre iut here doing but what if. this is why things are so shit,there is a time to wait for another side and a time to take a stand. this is def not that case I never said the American was white. I just gave the most plausible reason for such an absurd accusation on an Indian man sitting right beside his fiance. >with some wrong assumptions Bechara khali khuja raha hoga That’s because at least 80% are indeed perverts. You know that many women express how they got harrassed most frequently when they were under 16 (shy/defenseless)? This alters young girl’s minds to constant fear of it happening thus sometimes accusing the wrong person. It’s horrible that he got accused for no reason, but you can’t be surprised when these kinds of things happen in actuality all the damn time. Most absurdist and sexist claim I have ever heard in my life. Do update us on the FIR that you file along with the cabin crew report. Indians are well behaved abroad as far as I know. Too well behaved actually. But not in their motherland India. We indians are afraid of eachother here. Doubt the Lnd of Freedam will help a defamation case against a minor I hope he gets compensated for that and sues them for the headline. What’s the point? There are countless such cases in India itself where men have been made scapegoats, and left hung to dry when the accusations eventually fall apart on closer inspection in courts. Vishnu Tiwari spent 20 years in jail on false charges. Sarabjit Singh lost his army job. Dozens of men were victims to the infamous Rohtak Sisters and their “prank”. And these are just the ones that caught the media fancy. The latest in this series is the case against those boys from Mimbai who were accused of rape, and are being denied bail for some reason. I hope due legal process is followed and they get a fair trial. It did not say she is white. It only said American 'Absurdist and sexist' claim stating the fact that some men masturbated next to on planes? Looool. You're absurd, mate. And certainly sexist too. Not true. I’m not sure which country you’re talking about but Indians are looked down upon for their poor behaviour in several places. This includes staring at people especially women, treating service staff like personal slaves, poor personal hygiene and being obnoxiously loud. It’s so bad that in places like Switzerland, Bali and South Korea there are specific behavioural instructions for Indians. Idk why we’re trying to paint this false image, we are not respected in most places because we neither respect ourselves nor our fellow citizens. This is common for Indian. Rarely Indian filing defamation case. I never said people don't masturbate on planes. I just said singling out men is sexist and absurdist. And I'll still be waiting for you to post that FIR so do keep me updated. His sorry was evidence? Wait, I have 2 questions. Please solve my doubts I’ll be on the bandwagon to declare him guilty too. 1. If you read the screenshot, it said- the situation got heated up and escalated. As a man with no other info, there are several ways this could have been said. Maybe if he raised his voice. Maybe if he, as alleged, raped. Maybe if he hit her. Maybe they were playing fifa and he took it personal. Maybe he cursed her. Maybe he said some personal things. Point being, this apology isn’t an evidence of rape. How do you, me or any third party deduce this to be rape? 2. Even if the screenshot said I’m sorry I raped you, how do we check authenticity of the screenshot. I can make a screenshot like this in 5 minutes with your username stating you stole ₹10 lacs cash from my house and now I want my money back. Will you believe it? As far as the case is concerned, I’m all about justice. If the girl had, rape, molestation or even being hit physically, I’m with her. I want to make this public. I want news media to cover this too. All power to the girl all my support to her. But I don’t know the two parties personally, so how can I convict the guy? Basis what? We need a formal investigation. We need police involved. We need evidences. And if the guy is a culprit, I hope he rots in jail. F\\*ck, I’ll run him over with my car. But until we can’t say with evidence, why go after someone and their families? And regarding his personality and how this has been a repeated behaviour, let’s call that out. Let’s prove everything against him and make his life miserable. But until proven, we can’t ruin his and his family’s life. Just imagine if someone alleged something like this against you, and it was untrue but the media trial declared you guilty. Mind you, I am in no way trying to protect that guy. But rather I’m taking a stance against media trials. Amongst many other skills you're lacking, your reading comprehension skills are also sadly inadequate to understand my posts. I hope you know defamation cases can win you money and what was even your point to compare the cases in india?? Here in finland i have never heard or seen eny issues with our share of indian immigrants they even taught us to play criket as teens Caught up in Wrong Camera Angle ? It depends. Engineers, technicians, and doctors have a good reputation. Taxi drivers not so much. Though scamming taxi drivers come from all nationalities. I'm a woman. I'll go into the street, find the first scary looking man and accuse him of trying to molest me because the sexual harrasment in my country altered my mind. Being vigilant, being scared are all valid but accuse an innocent person, be it man or woman, of a crime they've never done should never be excused. This case is _different_ than the Mumbai case. Multiple women have found the courage to stand up against the sexual assaults that they’ve been subjected to by Heetik Shah (you named him yourself here). Multiple women are not crazy to falsely accuse one man, FFS. 🤦‍♂️ Why was the judge near his fiance? I mean your comment just reeks so much of bs that I don't even know where to start. >Some men do masturbate on planes Your first sexist claim >I am a frequent flyer and so far it happened to me \" twice (I am a woman) \" that the \"man\" sitting next to me was masturbating. Your 2nd point of lie. A liar when telling a lie is usually accompanied by a dissonance of facts. In the first line it was twice and yet the very next sentence it becomes \"the man\", a clear dissonance of what you are thinking vs what you are writing. You can read this up, it is called the Reid interrogation technique >When I called them out, both of them looked angry and offended. If it happens again, I'll probably report to the cabin crew and will consider a police complaint. A person caught in an act of sexual conduct can be reported by anyone, not to mention a person caught doing something like this would be more scared than offended since offense on a person mostly/only comes from a clash of logic and reason. I doubt the men would get offended \"both times\". And I doubt a man masturbating on a plane would have not made news by now, TWICE. You are in no way the only flier flying/sitting next to the supposed accused man. I am not telling that you may be lying, I am just saying it reeks a lot of it. Being a victim of sexual grooming, people like you spewing lies just make our own battles and traumas laughable. I am an Indian living in South Korea for 3 years, never heard of any \"instructions\"?! You could have made your point without making up stories. >neither of us can understand what happened Clearly his dick is a third party proven not guilty...not innocent Coz prosecutors' bosses (DA) have a quota to meet so they can flaunt it in the n next election campaign innocent until proven guilty, my guy I have never seen anything like this in 3 years, been welcomed everywhere in the country - in fact, found Koreans to be very hospitable to foreigners. Are you sure it's real? Did the Indian embassy comment on it, seems like it is tagged? This true. I have been half a year already in Saudi arabia, and every morning on the spot where I wait for my company service to pick me up, there always one Hindu Indian guy that is on jogging. And everytime he passes by me, he always look and stare at me weirdly. They are among the most people I've encountered that always give big deal to skin color and race origin. And I am an white skinned Asian. Just because you’ve not seen something, does not mean it doesn’t exist. The red pill nature of this comments section is sad Yeah, good that he opted for a judge and not a jury. The jury would have definitely announced him guilty because of racism. [Family guy](https://media.tenor.com/tT98FP7mMEEAAAAM/printer-family-guy.gif) Unhinged absolutely unhinged opinion this isnt a case of false accusation as much as youre trying to make it. its a case of rich people with connections getting away with crimes,lapping them up isnt gonna help any one of us. lord help us all The court ruling is not guilty. Innocent until proven guilty is only pre-trial, my guy U are getting downvote omg. Smartest, most sensible comment I have seen in a long time Canada entered the chat. Have you seen the racism in Canadian comment sections? Most of it is for being Indians not assimilating to western culture, poor hygiene, etc. So not guilty is not equal innocent.... Incredibly incorrect information. It applies both during and post-trial as well. For people who do horrible stuff, we can understand their reasons, their problems that led to them doing that but that does not make their actions right. Using empathy to judge right and wrong is clearly a dumb act. Most frequently is highly nondescript. Yes harassment happens and needs to be addressed, but is it all the time or just made more prevalent by sensationalism journalism that gladly sells all types of fear and outrage bait like hotcakes? Thus leading to expectation and added sensitivity. I would argue media obsession and attention to some topics often make them more extreme especially when it comes to strong emotions and impacts all of our developments. Hell even this app will gladly try to suck you down bad rabbit holes that mess with your mental if you let it. Girls have to deal with a lot but there also have been events where some manipulate and falsely accuse boys to ruin their lives out of spite or for clout. I don’t want to do the stupid gender war spiel (to me it’s always been a money/power gap war hidden as other things to distract) over this where we both leave thinking the other is some stupid idiot, but like, you are trying to use an actual relevant, rational justification in a subreddit where there was such a false accusation. That undermines it because it’s stated very broadly and on a false positive report. Makes people more skeptical of it overall cause the defense will be pulled out for anything. Not trying to gaslight and tell you to never speak your truth, because there are cases where harassment a******* getaway with it when they shouldn’t. (Normally cause they have money and power). And people should stick together so their voice is lost but there’s also times where we have to accept that someone in our perceived tribe can do wrong. If you are super familiar with details I’ll back off but it doesn’t seem so. If you are closer to this situation then talk it. But in my evaluation it’s more like a bit of an asspull argument for an asspull argument exchange at the moment. No no, I’m not trying to make it a case of false accusation. I’m simply trying to say, let’s believe evidence and not accusations. I apologise if my comment came out like this is a false accusation. I didn’t intend that. I solely intend to understand how, we, as a society evaluate cases that come to light and not be the judge ourselves. Hes an american, what does this have to do with us? /s They have elections for post of public prosecutor? TIL This reminds me of that one time in a crowded bus but the back of the bus, where I was seated, was relatively empty and this one guy pulls his p*nis out, shakes it and flashes me, all under 15 sec. I was so grossed out but immediately stood up and went to complain to the conductor but the guy unboarded as soon as he could.🤢🤢🤢 OP's being unfair to you. Welcome to USA. Comments like this and women like you scare me the most. You may feel that Indians behave poorly - that's your perception. My point is, there are no \"behavior instructions for Indians in South Korea\". I know right? I don’t even know what I’m saying wrong I’m trying to be as politically correct as I can How was his fiancée next to him 💀 Something that should only be done if a guilty verdict is reached. >Multiple women are not crazy to falsely accuse ONE man, FFS. Lol no. Look up the case of Ex-Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy. He was accused by 9 women and he was found not guilty on every single accusation. The point is you never know. It's best to leave it to people who are actually trained in handling this shit. Sue them back for defamation Throw that minor b*tch in jail! Lock her up with the same sentence duration that the accused would get if convicted. I read most of what you said, and I agree with this woman when she says that your reading comprehension needs work. Cna tou stop being pos press and give the actual title you're saying a not guilty verdict is a verdict that the defendant is innocent? Post-trial? The court is giving an \"innocent\" verdict? Do you have any proof that this is how courts work? Indians are kinda chill over here in the US What are you talking about? How is saying \"Some men masturbate on planes\" a sexist claim? It's just a statement of fact. The second point is internally consistent? Maybe you don't understand English particularly well but there is nothing contradictory in what was said there. Yes. Court has not proved innocence. It has only proved that the defendant is not guilty. Yep... depending on the state, they even have elections for judges, police chiefs (sheriff), comptroller (aka controller in the US), and other public office positions that would ve unusual in India Apparently lower court judges are reluctant(idk the right word) of issuing bails. Lol no fucking way should minors be separated from their families. The saying is innocent until proven guilty. Not innocent when proven not guilty. Grammatically itself the saying cannot be applied post-trial Yes, because there’s no such thing as an ‚innocent‘ verdict. Look up literally any court or law office and check this. It’s like asking if a not-wet verdict really means they’re dry. I have two problems with your comment. Hear me out, I’m trying to get educated. I might be wrong, please help me see things from your perspective. Point out how and where I am going wrong. 1. If you say this case is different than others, are we not making victims who have suffered rape/ molestation/ other unjust treatment, at disadvantage? Why should someone who was subjected to these atrocities be treated differently just because their perpetrator was not a regular offender? Should we not evaluate every case with the same degree? Why should victims of first offenders be treated differently? 2. Secondly, I don’t know if multiple women outed him. If they did, more likely than not, they were saying the truth. But, have we verified the truth? How can we say with conviction that this guy is guilty? Of the previous occurrences too? Me and my group of friends can also launch a full fledged attack on someone, anyone, right? Mind you, I’m sorry for this previous statement, I’m not trying to undermine any person who went through his assaults, but merely trying to evaluate situation from a neutral standpoint. I’m not taking his side. If he was an actual culprit, I really hope he rots in jail. I’m just trying to establish my point that we should investigate into things before we believe it. I’m aware my comment will be heavily downvoted. I know it sounds like I’m undermining multiple people who might have faced actual harassments. I apologise to them all. I’m not for this behaviour. 1.Some men do masturbate on planes Commenter claims most ment masturbate on plane. (Yet when you search \"plane masturbation videos almost all search results are women 💀) 2.I am a frequent flyer Commenter flies in planes frequently 3.and so far it happened to me twice (I am a woman) that the man sitting next to me was masturbating Twice men sitting next to her started masturbating (sounds to me like some sort of narcissistic trait at this point and looking at commenter post history) 4.. When I called them out, both of them looked angry and offended. The men were offended instead of scared (why? Idk.) 5.If it happens again, I'll probably report to the cabin crew and will consider a police complaint. Why not report it the first time and instead wait for another chance???. So tell me which part of the comment did I get wrong since your reading comprehension is so good I read most of what you said, and I agree with this woman when she says that your reading comprehension needs work. > it happened to me twice (I am a woman) that the man sitting next to me was masturbating She framed the sentence that way, because she's referring two different instances of a man masturbating next to her in a flight. This is not the commenter getting \"caught up in her web of lies\". Besides, you accuse the commenter of being sexist, while also going out of your way to make assumptions about her integrity Considering she was clearly right about the fact that some men masturbate on planes, your visceral reaction to her comment and vehement denial of her experience, does reek of something, but I can't tell what There's no such thing as an innocent verdict because the court hasn't proved innocence. The evidence considered is not for the defendant to be proved innocent, it's for him to be proved not guilty, so the court cannot make that verdict. You're almost there. > It’s like asking if a not-wet verdict really means they’re dry. Proving the absence of something doesn't prove the presence of anything else. You're assuming since one thing is not proved then the opposite must be proved. These are not prime numbers, the verdict is not binary. Not guilty is a verdict given when reasonable doubt is taken into consideration, there is always a case of the courts being wrong. \"A not-guilty verdict does not mean that the defendant is innocent, but rather that the prosecution has not met its burden of proving guilt.\" This is literally what the law says. So please stop being ignorant and read up. he is the victim in this case. then why his face is not being blurred? when its some female, special care is given to not leak their identity, why not him? I'm a girl and I'm so disheartened to see not only this man got wrongly accused but now noone seems to care of his privacy. fuck this gender bias of media!!! This should be posted on r/news and r/worldnews. Matriarchy moment So it's entirely plausible that a sexually spun up and repressed Indian guy might do this kind of thing (happened to my wife in an international flight, and she knew because he actually touched her multiple times in places you aren't supposed to touch people), but in the case of this poor doctor, it sounds much more likely he's simply the subject of racism and paranoia. The only evidence to the accuser apparently was that his pants weren't entirely zipped. I can't tell you how many times I've checked my zipper and thought (\"crap, how have I been walking around for an hour with my fly unzipped?!\") I think it's a travesty too that this would be in the news and for his face to be plastered all over the place. He was declared innocent, and a lot of people won't read past the headline. Someone declared innocent shouldn't continue to have their reputation ruined. This is the post Jury would have been stupid tbh, they wouldnt help but be sensationalized by the news. Look here mudhead I'll explain something. Hypothetically: You have 3 bananas. You keep it under heavy surveillance. It gets stolen by a 5ft 2in woman. Police arrested and produced me in trial for stealing the banana. The court rules that I am NOT GUILTY because 1. I am taller than 5ft 2in and 2. I am a man. So am I innocent or am I still 🤡guilty but only not guilty because court said so 🤡 Those opinions are often of Indians in Canada. Other countries Indians have been amazing immigrants like the UK, US, Ireland etc. He wasn’t proven innocent, he was found not guilty. There’s a big difference between the two. Yes because they have point system for their promotion. They receive points every year on number of judgements given , number of cases decided , number of settlements effected etc. Their career can be severely affected if the high court / Supreme Court passes strictures. Therefore they chose to err on the side of caution and prefer to not think outside the box. They will simply do the conventional thing. However High Court Judges and Supreme Court judges don’t have any point system or promotion system. Therefore they are relatively flexible / fearless in making decisions Fr. False accusations that include sexual misconduct/rape can potentially ruin the social and/or professional life of any man. Search \"plane masturbation videos\" and tell me how many men come up in your search. Then I'll accept the claim as a \"statement of fact\". Accusing a single gender when other genders post exactly the same thing for money just screams sexist and uneducated to me. Idiots like you are the reason why Andrew Tate exists. Mr Ben Shapiro over here. You cannot use an analogy to prove anything \"mudhead\". Life doesn't work like that. Evidence for different cases varies differently. Most importantly THIS IS WHAT THE LAW SAYS: \"A not-gulty verdict does not mean that the defendant is innocent, but rather that the prosecution has not met its burden of proving guilt.\" Now hypothetically get this information into your head and hypothetically gain some iq points as well, you're bringing down the national average. Hypothetically, of course. >these people on reddit were calling out the guy’s insta handle, his parent’s names, his mother’s business name, asking people to go give them hate. That's just to bring awareness. Heetik Shah is powerful and rich. Has industrial and bollywood friends. Got Salman Khan's lawyer (One of best criminal lawyers in the country). So chances of the victim getting justice are very slim. This reminds me of the movie “The Hunt” aka “jagten” Dude, in the last 12 months, at least 8 desi parents have killed their spouse and/or kids in the USA. Dude, in the last 12 months, at least 8 desi parents have killed their kids in the USA. Shame Just in UK: Sexual harrasment is very common and blatantly all young girls experience it some point. These problems run deeper than the surface. Ew don't name Ben Shapiro here. He's one hell of cringe person I don't want to associate with 🤮🤮 Well anyways moving onto this incident, the judgement of Not guilty = innocent here because there were other eye witnesses along with his own Fiancee who was sitting next to him on the flight. And the judge cleared all the charges against him on the basis of these witnesses. If you still think he is guilty of masturbating even with so many witnesses' testimonials, I think you just hate him in general for no fault of his. >Most importantly THIS IS WHAT THE LAW SAYS: >\"A not-gulty verdict does not mean that the defendant is innocent, but rather that the prosecution has not met its burden of proving guilt.\" What you and I think is of no consequence of this is what the law says What is there hard to understand? How can you be surprised that these things happen all the time? I understand that you don’t talk to women often and jump to conclusions but cmoon now. Just in uk: He wasnt proven innocent, and they're the prosecution of course they say that. I love it when crusty male redditors get so up in their feelings about 'false' claims of abuse. For some reason y'all never care about other injustices this much 🤔 Don't worry, no western women would ever want to have sex with your crusty ass anyway Pageet For a minute I wasn't sure you were talking about India or USA Says amtrakJoesHOE. I don't think you care about \"injustices\" so stop strawmaning. You are so full of shit, the toilet’s jealous. Have a nice day, somewhere else. How exactly was he cleared of wrong doing? It's not clear. You can have two people sitting next to you on a plan. I wonder if he was covered In a blanket and bouncing his leg and the girl misunderstood and it never slipped down? We have cameras in all public places why not planes What are you even trying to say in this bizarre rambling reply? You think that no men have ever masturbated on a plane? Or maybe only things that are on video are real? Im not going to look up that search term, but I bet there's plenty of results. Enjoy, if that's what you are into. Indecent exposure is well documented as a gendered issue, with the majority of perpetrators of indecent exposure being men, and the majority of victims being women. You can check relevant statistics in UK, US, and other reports. This is non controversial information to anyone with basic common sense, never mind just a few cursory internet searches. Is this a joke? It's literally one of the worst places to be born female. It's so hilarious you prove how different the privileges are there. Men are scared of the big bad threat of false accusation, even though it's extremely rare and girls are often punished for anything that happens to them. Meanwhile women and girls are scared of the very real threat of gang rape, which literally happens very often. It would be filed against the parents… Is this supposed to be some kind of slam dunk or something 😂😂😂 yes you pageets need to know where you rank, it wouldn't hurt your feelings if you didn't know it was true. His fiancee and he claimed there was no blanked and no leg shaking. No, a jury is more likely to have members who dissent. A judge who is racist would be worse. According to American law, I assume trial was done I America (too lazy to read the article) but when you are declared as not guilty, it means that the evidence provided was not enough to prove a guilty verdict. He isn't innocent, but is not guilty of the crime. Prosecution was unable to show enough evidence that he committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. He in no way is innocent, he could have very well committed the crime, and there is no evidence of it. But tbf, that's like speculating cuz I assume all the relevant evidence is brought to table, discussed, and is not enough to show that the person committed the crime. No racist btch this was supposed to be a fvck you. Now Fvck off. Where do rednecks come into the picture? This flight was from Honolulu to Boston. No rednecks to be found in either lmao Bruh actually tried framing men as victims in India lol Yeah I wouldn't say the US has the best Indian immigrants. Especially in the past few years. > He wasnt proven innocent Innocent until proven guilty. It's fuck According to the law, which I don't give a fuck about. Slavery was legal. White men owning your country and fucking your women, also legal 😂 Bruh don't piss that asshole he may get angry and start a mass shooting in schools Think of being born in poor sections of africa and Iran, North Korea, many central American countries, Islamic nations. There are lots of countries worse than us. Scary, growing up in the states one of my best friends family took in 2 cousins when their uncle was on drugs. One of the girls (11 or 12) accused the step dad of molestation and such. After horrible month of him in jail and investigation she admitted she made it all up. She turned out to be a bad kid when she’s grew up. in the US media it's allowed to shame someone publicly before they are proven to be guilty Genuinely asking, was he beyond any doubt found to be not guilty of the crime or was he given a \"not guilty\" verdict because of the benefit of doubt? Asking cuz both are very different things and the article doesn't mention what it was. If its the former he should definitely sue the prosecutors cuz the accusations are proven to be false but if its the latter then the comments here make no sense which are calling out the girl for false accusation as it would not be proven to be false This is exactly the problem with guilty until found innocent narrative That’s discrimination. Law is just for the poor and the rich. Just because he is rich means he and his family should be subject to online bullying? Doesn’t make any sense. So what he hired the same lawyer as Salman khan did. YOURE collectively shaming someone for having money as well as a lawyer who has made his reputation by working for years and now charges a bomb. Neither is wrong. And what awareness is generated by asking people to boycott and spread hate on his mother’s business? Or his family? I mean, even if he was the culprit, proven also, what’s his family’s fault? It’s always the straight cis guys Read the title and news source again No, that’s not it. It won’t be good optics for the doctor to take action against the family of the complainant as she’s a minor. My prediction…the doctor is going to get into legal trouble again in the next 5 years. Just my prediction. Lmao who are we to point fingers at them? Look in the mirror, false cases are norm here, and people get their lives ruined like daily, much more than America. We need to fix our own law system first. Atleast it concluded trial within 3 days Racism If it quacks like a duck. There's a reason indians have a reputation for being sexual .miscreants. It is so interesting to me that women like you believe acknowledging the social/legal disadvantages men face somehow detracts from the issues women face. So many of you will complain to the moon and back when men bring up male issues in conversations where women are discussing theirs, but the moment someone draws attention to the gloomy legal circumstances of men, your response is, \"B-b-but what about the women women have it so much worse what about meeeeeee?!??\" It’s not. Statistically speaking. Feelings wise sure. The girl in Mumbai case has been moving from pillar to post for the proper process to be followed, in terms of hearings, the accused and her medical examinations etc. And she isn't getting it due to the accused being from influential family. She's doing this while being slutshamed and victim-blamed by 95% of male Indian internet. Apparently we are only supposed to be skeptical of victims now and pre-emptively blame them, rather than the accused. *Even if they are only asking for the process to be followed.* Lol, I had planned to never travel by train after college and use flights exclusively. I guess I have to move it up a tier and only travel business or first class. I just don't want to be near any human. Same here brother, same here Never sit next to a teenager. To can request a seat change if you don’t want to sit next to them An excellent fucking movie!!! This anti Indian hatred is growing in us . I keeping my distance from kids after watching that movie Are you funny in your parody or a complete and total idiot? It’s so hard to tell these days… I’ll assume your joking and wish you well :) Usually the prosecutors evaluate \"winnability\" of cases like this before putting it from of a judge or jury. So they probably felt like they had some case but they didn't. They will never say anything like \"the right verdict was delivered\" Careful, don't incite her to make false accusations against you. Why his face is shown everywhere? You can be the sheriff without any law enforcement experience, it's weird as shit Note how they emphasize **\"Indian origin\"**, I bet if he cured cancer it'll be American doctor cures cancer We're quite happy being the ethnic group with the highest average income in the US, nearly double that of white Americans. So yeah we know where we rank. Now run back to 4chan with the rest of you incel neckbeard losers and go whine about \"pajeets\" stealing your jobs or whatever. You trailer trash will never compare. In theory it's supposed to act as a form of government transparency by eliminating the possibility of shadow trials. What really sucks is knowing if they're actually innocent doesn't factor into this equation, if they think they can get you convicted despite knowing you're innocent they're gonna try their best to throw you in prison Says the loser from his basement. >Law is just for the poor and the rich. Not really, rich people (specially bollywood) got away with some of high profile crimes. Ex: Salman Khan, Sanjay Dutt >Just because he is rich means he and his family should be subject to online bullying? Online bullying is bad but honestly, it is nothing compared to the crime in question. >I mean, even if he was the culprit, proven also, what’s his family’s fault? Supporting a criminal is crime in itself. So if his family aided in crime or fallout, they should be punished too. That's such a fucking disgusting thing to accuse an innocent person of Lol they are probably a school shooting drug addict. I mean if they knew they're innocent then they wouldn't push the conviction that hard. Technically they're largely driven by numbers and not much else. Like I seriously doubt this guy would have gone to prison even. Probably would have fined him and put him on a RSO list. Nah you’re getting it wrong. Why are we not raising a concern that proper process is not being followed? Why are we not making that the agenda rather than deciding who is guilty and shaming him and his family? Why are the posts being posted asking for her support not condemning the police / authorities? Why are the posts being made with a guilty verdict in media? I don’t get that. Also, made up stats to further your agenda. While I agree some section of society (male and female both) are shaming her and blaming her (note: I’m absolutely against that); not 95% of Indian male are from that category. From numerous posts, I did see a lot of male audience sympathising with her and supporting her, me included. But making up a narrative to further your opinion is, in my opinion, wrong. What are you talking about? Please tell me has an Indian ever robbed a store or something in the USA or caused riots? Most Indians are very grateful to have work in the states and I don't feel they will ever sabotage their own and India's reputation there. He just described his trial as a nightmare that's finally over, do you think he's interested in reliving it all over again in a defamation case? He's a physician, so I imagine he's doing well financially already. Also, are you suggesting that the accusation from the minor was race related? Because the American judicial system seems to be mostly just biased against black Americans, and then primarily in criminal matters. For whatever reason today doesn't seem to spread to civil cases. Of course, I've encountered plenty of racism against Indians (both the Indians from India and native Americans, called Indians historically but considered offensive now) but it's always been in the form of jealousy of Indian Americans' wealth (perceived or real, either way). It's always about Indians owning all the motels and liquor stores and convenience stores, and every doctor being Indian. I couldn't tell you how many times I've heard somebody tell me about how Indians \"come over here and buy up all the gas stations, and they can do it because they don't have to pay taxes for seven years after they get here! And then they bring their brother and transfer the store to their name, and they don't have to pay taxes for seven years! I could buy a motel too if I didn't have to pay taxes!\" It's honestly ridiculous. I've always responded asking why don't they pay taxes? And the answer is always the same, \"I don't know.\" Then I say \"well that don't sound right\" which they always say again, \"I don't know.\" And I say, well maybe they do pay taxes, which gets another \"I don't know\". There seems to be a lot these people don't know. Anyhow, all this to just say that racism in America isn't a monolith. It comes in many different colors and shades, and blends in well with a lot of other forms of bigotry we have here. What else can you expect from the Me Me Me Gender? Good Lord I'm an idiot. I completely misunderstood your comment. I need to sleep. I’m sorry Sanjay Dutt got away with it? If I’m not wrong, didn’t he serve jail time? And no, while you might point out a few examples of Bollywood celebs, I can point out certain examples of commoners who got away with crime too. Heck, 2 examples I can quote from my own family too. But given someone is rich cannot and should not be held against them. If you do well in your career and make lots of money out of your own efforts, should you be treated differently than, for example me, who didn’t make enough money? It seems like you’re advocating for a skewed system of law basis financial status. Also, agreed. Online bullying is nothing in comparison to the alleged crime of rape. But the difference is, you are favouring the side of committing a crime (online bullying) basis allegations of another crime. In a nutshell, my question is, who are we (you, me, other people) to decide who is a criminal and who is not and hand them out punishments? Should we not be standing to create awareness of the allegation, create a pressure on the authorities to act on it rather than handing out verdicts? Who are trained exactly? The police who can be easily bought in this country? Or the corrupt judiciary who can _also_ be bought? I wish I had the faith _you_ have in our system. What does it have to do with his origin ?. This is where USA is much better than India and still it's pretty obvious that she was one Lmfao In the same way that prosecutors were disappointed after OJ was found not guilty. From their perspective, they still think he did it, they just failed to convince the jury of it. There’s nothing they can do about it though bc of double jeopardy Twist: his fiancee was the minor Source? Why so much hatred for Indians? Are you Heetik's friend, or are you getting paid for these comments? >there always one Hindu Indian guy that is on jogging How do you know his religion just my watching him jog? Mads Mikkelson from The Hunt moment kinda Only Hindus have that red dot in their forehead. Fly private. Bruh it's called bindi and only women wear that, not men. You're clearly lying. Bhai, pay karwa de. Chalega mereko logical comment karne ke paise milna. We Indians are also Asian That's because it's a headline from an Indian news site. Women? Lol maybe you are the one whose not Indian. Cause we can see them having that red mark on their forehead. I don't know about your culture, but anyways Hindu men are everywhere here in Saudi, and so was Muslim Indians. Stay strong. I just read the other response and can see what you mean. Blanket + bouncing motion looks like masturbation. I’ve seen classmates of mine do this and own up to it in school growing up here in the US. I’ve also seen videos on Reddit catching other dudes doing the same thing in Japan and other countries. Which means…drum roll here…he’s considered innocent. You’re conflating the legal definition and the vernacular here. Just search \"bindi\" on the Google and see the images, you'll get your answer. I lived all my life here in Delhi and travelled throughout India, never saw a single man wear bindi. why is this such a big news? You're joking right? The discussion is clearly about the legal definition. Are you slow at understanding everything or just this? A few possible reasons: 1. They still think he's guilty, because they are letting their desire to win cases (or, perhaps, racism) cloud their judgement. Or just because they're well-intentioned, but happen to be wrong (it happens!). 2. They don't think he's guilty, but if they said that, it'd be embarrassing for them (\"we were prosecuting an innocent man, whoopsie!\") So they feel they have to continue to act like they think he's guilty. 3. He *is* guilty, and they correctly believe it, they just can't prove it. (Keep in mind that in US courts, being found not guilty simply means you are not guilty *beyond a reasonable doubt*. If the judge thought there was a 70% chance he did it and a 30% chance he was innocent, he'd still be declared not guilty.) Without seeing the evidence for ourselves, it's hard to know which of these is the case. All white women are whores There is no legal definition of innocent, because a court does not define one. It literally says that in the next sentence quotation you put up. Are you slow? Nope. As someone working here in Saudi, I can clearly attest what I saw. Men wear that red dot, if not red dot sometimes that's like a red line in between their eyes. Muslims have no tradition like that, only Hindus. If you want, go here at Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Anyway, same thing and same story I will tell to my friends back in my country. If you don't believe, then so be it. I'm not Hindu anyway, so I care less about the significance of that red dot or marking, but men and women wear it. Go to any LuLu hypermarket in Saudi during Thursdays when Indians go shopping, and your fingers aren't enough to count how many Indians you'll see them having that mark. Tell me one thing, dear madam. Say, you have raised your son to be the most upstanding and honourable gentleman. You have seen that he has proven himself to be a good, kind, and successful man who respects everybody equally. Now, one day, a woman claims that he assaulted her. A media witch trial starts, and everybody thinks he is guilty even when there is NO evidence provided by the accuser. Would you still exhibit this cold-hearted and cavalier attitude towards your own son, in pursuit of your \"noble feminist principles\"? If you are a normal human being with a functioning emotional quotient, then I am sure you would be devastated at this hypothetical scenario, would you not? If yes, then why is it so difficult for you to extend this same compassion towards all the men who are stuck in such predicaments? Are they not somebody's else son? A father to a child? A husband to a wife? We often say that we must be compassionate towards women's struggles because these same women are our dearest sisters, mothers, wives, and daughters, yes? So I wonder why feminists (and even society in general) do not extend this same empathy towards men. Ultimately these men are our dearest brothers, fathers, husbands, and sons, aren't they? The staggering lack of empathy towards male struggles never fails to astound me. And then feminists have the fucking gall to bullshit about how men need to emotionally open up? We all know it's lip service. Because when men actually open up, feminists like YOU shut them down, dear madam. That's why I said the verdict is not guilty... Not innocent. That was my first comment. Please keep up. Which means vernacularlly, he’s innocent. Thanks for keeping up! But the discussion was on the legal definition, like I said a few comments ago. You're still too slow! The portion i was discussing was innocent until proven guilty applying post-trial, which it does in this case, since he wasn’t proven guilty he’s innocent. Thanks for playing! People like her are the reason why we cannot have productive and nuanced discussions on gender issues. Every fucking issue has to be turned into a pointless gender war. Do not be disheartened though. I know plenty of women in real life who care about men's issues. And I know plenty of men in real life who care about women's issues. Sane and emotionally well-adjusted men and women have the capacity to understand that both sexes face unique struggles, without turning it into a flaming battleground. Explain Innocent until proven guilty is a legal requirement. There's no \"vernacular\" requirement for this phrase. We don't have to socially follow innocent until proven guilty. So therefore you were discussing the legal verdict just by making this statement. You lose once again! Yes we do, otherwise we’d (the jury) assume guilty mid-trial. Which we don’t, because we need proof beyond a reasonable doubt. There's no jury lmao In this case, sure, it was just the judge (who still follows the prior statement! he counts as jury in this case imo) I’m talking about in general. How does this non-sequitur add any value to the discussion? He can't sue the prosecutors unless they did a procedural misconduct. He can only sue the accuser for defamation (even if it's a minor) What a pervert. He definitely did it. Everything stated is my personal opinion. No... It's standard and nobody can successfully sue for defamation because they're careful to use words like \"accused\" and \"alleged\" Not being convicted does not mean the other side is making things up and lying. It only mean that they could not prove that's what he was doing. I have no info on this case, but no guilty can mean a lot of thing ranging from insufficient proof but real to completely made up. He's a doctor and has money could be either one He should really only do that if he's actually innocent and maybe not even then. If he actually did it and got off due to lack of evidence then he could easily lose a defamation case and even be countersued. What's the matter? My dearest Karen, you can't even afford a home in your own damn country. Look at you. \"Indian Americans have risen to become the richest ethnicity in America, with an average household income of $126,891, almost twice the U.S. average of $65,316.\" - Wikipedia But it's fine, you can remain a perennial renter for the rest of your life, with $10 for your retirement. But nah, it's those darned \"Pageets\" in your life , that are responsible for most of your woes, hmm? A guy found not guilty in jerking off on a plane is not worldnews His lawyer failed him, this never should have gone to trial or even made it past a grand jury. The only other explanation is that he did it which is just too bizarre to believe especially when his partner was right there. Note: I didn’t read the story or the case… don’t plan on it either… I’m just answering ur post A significant amount of cases in the USA where the person is found not guilty the person was doing something wrong but certain circumstances, elements of what makes something a crime vs not, what lvl of crime (misdemeanor vs felony), how awesome ur lawyer is (OJ Simpson) can help someone get off. When they charge people with crimes in USA they generally charge for felonies if it’s possible so they can get the person to plea down to the misdemeanor. It they don’t take a deal, the felony charges will be what the jury has to rule on. Felonies have extra stuff that makes them worse and adds more the prosecution must prove. In the vast majority of cases the person did something wrong and they cannot sure the people who made the claim. If the person lied and it was clear from the trial he would sue… he won’t because he was doing something inappropriate > So many of you will complain to the moon and back when men bring up male issues in conversations where women are discussing theirs Maybe because it’s not the time and place? If women are talking about how something affects us as women, and then some man comes in and goes, “Oh yeah, well, what about the men???” It’s just another instance of being dismissed by men when we’re trying to talk about something important. Also, being falsely accused of rape/sexual assault isn’t a male issue anywhere. Men are far more likely to actually be sexually assaulted than falsely accused of it. The percentages of both aren’t even close. If you want to focus on male issues then focus on that. And how there’s still such little conversation about it, that men like you are led to believe the worst thing you can possibly go through is some “scorned woman” falsely accusing you of something. The anti-racism leaving everyone’s bodies when a member of a racial minority does something bad. That still doesn't justify illegal detention of innocent men by the men. You are doing more harm than good for women if you are support such policies. They can never be victims? India's Ranking as per the 2023 edition of the global Women Peace and Security Index (WPS Index) : 128 / 177 There are 49 nations beneath us. We aren't the best, but compared to our neighbours, we are much better. Especially, with our large population. [https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/) Not a single bit of physical evidence, and none of the nearby passengers reinforced the accustions. Yet, the Indian man was charged. Sounds about racist. Oh, my bad. I apologise. I misunderstood the tone of your comment. Were you replying to the redditor who said that India is the one of the worst places to be born as a woman? Never forget about what happened to Emmett Till. I think the planet was disappointed OJ didn’t go to jail for a very long time. The keyword is \"three-day trial\". In India, it would have taken 3 decades to get justice. So he had a blanket on and the girl claimed when it fell off she saw his zip undone and claimed he masturbated until ejaculation? That’s a really big accusation. Has anyone questioned the girl in question? Did she do it cz she thought it would be funny? Or was it cZ she’s raised racist? Not melanine content. In any such cases, the identity of the accused male is made publicly exposed, even after being cleared of charges (notice how they have exposed his last employment details), but the girl's details are hidden. It's all sexism, not racism. Planes are usually cramped to the brim. If no one other than that one girl is saying it then the chances are that it didn't happen. they are discussing a case where a man was literally potentially falsely accused how is it not the time or place lol? I don’t think anybody is talking about what’s worse simply that a man’s lively hood shouldn’t be ruined because of false accusation, it has nothing to do with ‘if it’s worse than actually being raped’ Men have far more control over being raped than being accused of it > Maybe because it’s not the time and place? Right. His point was, why does it suddenly become ‘the right time and place’ when women bring up women’s issues in conversations discussing men’s issues. You can write hoe for a prostitute but he can't write fvck for fuck. Are wah. This happened in USA and his work and personal lives were ruined Oh boy that was a heartbreaking movie He was wrongfully shamed across the world originally, only fair his innocence is equally publicised. Sounds like you don’t know what you’re talking about lol. How does one prove that they didn't do something? Eye witness accounts are the best you can do in this case and it looks like they favored his narrative more than the girl's. It's easy to parrot talking points \"not GuilTy doEsNt meAN iNNocEnt\" but put yourselves in his shoes. He went through the ordeal even though he was innocent ( assume that for one minute even though the thought of an Indian male being innocent might be inconceivable to you) and now you are still holding him to a standard which can never be met. No court in the land will give an innocent verdict regardless of the strength of his argument. > Why would they still be on his tail after he's proven innocent? To be technically accurate, you can't be \"proven innocent\" in US courts. There's only \"guilty\" and \"not guilty\". \"Not guilty\" does not mean innocent; it just means the State failed to meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Sometimes, prosecutors believe the person was guilty and they could've got him/her if they had more convincing evidence. (Sometimes, it's false bravado too.) Most women don't want to say in public they have been sexually assaulted..... Get grilled by lawyers about details of an assault.... If there was no proof, the DA shouldn't have brought it to trial. one big difference is that US publications always put accused, alleged, etc..as those are legal terms and not putting them can set them up for defamation lawsuits as they haven't been convicted of anything. whereas in india newspapers have no problem saying this guy killed his wife on the thursday night after first killing his neighbor. even when no charges have been filed and the person has just been arrested or is a suspect who hasn't been found To be fair. These kinds of accusations are much more common here in India. A Girl made fake accusations. Could this be linked to racism, since none of us know the race and ethnicity of the child 🤷‍♂️? Wow that minor kid is a fucking racist .. 6 months back, people in Boston subreddit blasted him left and right (somewhat understandably, trusting the teen's words), some even changed him as their PCP. The Beth Israel, where he practiced made him step down. Can't even imagine what all he went through. Really glad that he got the justice. That so called \"teen\", she has to a see a psychiatrist! Thank God, atleast he was found not guilty. It's like, people hear India or Indian-origin, and they automatically assume all the guys in the country are a$$holes. I mean, dude, try to see some proof and then decide your judgement. Don't just follow the crowd blindly. The hatred towards our race is increasing day-by-day globally. Dunno, where it's gonna lead soon. In a country where women are scared shitless to wander freely, men's issues from fake accusations pale in comparison Kinda disappointing that even when he’s acquitted of all charges you’re casting aspersions on his character citing lack of evidence. He’s not guilty. That’s all there is. Not guilty and innocent are different pronouncements. Absence of evidence != evidence of absence. Innocent until proven guilty applies for defamation as well. Legally, you’re correct. But it’s all semantics. How is a man supposed to ever clear his name if falsely accused in any case? Is it fair to tag them for life even if no wrongdoing is proven? I am not even advocating for defamation case but can’t get behind still being doubtful of the person who’s been cleared. I barfed while reading it! Almost. 😦 disgusting Why would you not report it right away? What if they have done this to other women? Wouldn't you have been able to stop it from happening to other women then? I suggest reading the article and the documents attached. Even the comments have interesting things to say. > Mohanty's lawyer, Claudia Lagos, however, charged that the girl never reported her story to anybody during the flight and that in the days and weeks to follow, she repeatedly changed just what that story was, changing from an initial report the man next to her was masturbating under a blanket to eventually saying he was exposed to her: > [T]he lack of trustworthiness is highlighted by the utter lack of corroborative evidence, despite the behavior allegedly taking place in a setting replete with witnesses. Every version of events by the complainant is different, each less likely than the next, increasing in untrustworthiness and striking lack of corroboration. So basically no one except the girl saw it so there is no corroboration. But man the accusation is so graphic than newspapers let on: > Minor A is expected to testify that midway through Flight 90, within her view, a man > (which other evidence will demonstrate is Mohanty2 ) exposed his penis, masturbated, and > ejaculated. Although he had been covered by a blanket for a period of time, at some point the > blanket came off him, and she saw his exposed penis, his hand moving up and down it, and him > ejaculating. Minor A is also expected to testify that this was the first time that Minor A had seen > an adult male penis or male masturbation and that she was very disturbed and upset by what she > saw. **After witnessing Mohanty expose his penis, masturbate, and ejaculate, Minor A moved to a** > **row behind her assigned seat, in which there were two empty seats.** More on this: > Not a lawyer, and haven’t reviewed this case, but the bar for criminal is “beyond a reasonable doubt” and for civil is “more likely than not”. > Given that federal prosecutors had enough evidence to convince a grand jury to indict, I would speculate that if this case was brought in civil court, it would have the opposite outcome. > Based upon that, I suspect that a defamation case would fail, and he would be countersued for damages. So while he could bring that case, it would likely be a bad idea. The girl is a child; they shouldn't have exposed her name anyway. Neither the accused person's, but two wrongs don't make a right. Please don't make this an MRA issue. What? Indian constitution also says innocent until proven guilty, same as USA. It’s not the same way. Prosecutors were disappointed in OJ’s case because OJ was guilty and there was circumstantial evidence. It got derailed with the gloves gimic and the racial aspect. OJ was then found liable for the murders in a civil suit. In the case the man did not pull out his dick and jerk one off. How are they the same way? Yes, but the absolute numbers for the latter aren't quite less considering our population. Promoting narratives like _men cannot be victims_ will only make it harder for us to make things better for the women. what are the general castes of the falsely accused and the general castes of those who get away with it despite heavy evidence? Except due process means that you need to be proven guilty, not that you need to be proven innocent. You're innocent unless proven guilty so when that doesn't happen you *are* indeed innocent. >\"Not guilty\" does not mean innocent It kinda does though. You're by default innocent, so if you're not proven guilty you remain innocent. Fuck off Not quite. There is a *presumption* of innocence, and the prosecution has to prove guilt. Not to be confused with actual innocence. That's why the verdict is \"not guilty\", not \"innocent\". Sending love back. Good luck ❤️🍀 The verdict could never be \"innocent\" because proving a negative is impossibility most of the time. However you from a legal standpoint you *are* innocent at all times if not proven guilty. Is it though? He was found innocent but his life is basically ruined already. Because they don't care about convicting guilty people, they only care about convicting people. Exactly! adding this as 1056th item in my never-to-do list Lol Wouldn’t be the first time an Indian has pulled on his penis on a plane. Why would that irk you? Any prosecutor is disappointed to lose a case, just so is any lawyer or anyone who does anything and fails at it. They will always maintain that he was guilty and why wouldn't they? Any prosecutor will always say this for any case they lose. I mean you can request whatever you want but I’ve never heard of an airline giving a seat change for such a thing. You could ask another passenger I suppose and hope they’re nice This is an MRA issue. Would it not be a feminist issue if the accusation were to be true? kind of fucked up that they made sure to include his ethnicity in this article. almost like they want to sow division or something. >The accusations stem from an incident that occurred in May 2022 aboard a Hawaiian Airlines flight. The unnamed minor accused Sudipta Mohanty of masturbating until ejaculation claiming she noticed the blanket he had up to his neck had fallen and his pants were unzipped, according to a report by the New York Post. She claimed Sudipta Mohanty placed a blanket on top of him and was bouncing his leg before the blanket slipped down. This wasn’t just a claim she saw his hand jerking, she claimed she saw it. It’s enough evidence to investigate and prosecute, but the judge didn’t find enough evidence to convict. He wasn’t “proven innocent.” The court ruled there was not enough evidence to convict, not that he was “proven” to not have done it. Look up section 498A. Ok.... I did. I don't get your point though. When prosecutors believe through their own investigation with the police that a person has committed a crime, they then present the case to a judge/jury, hoping for a guilty verdict. If the court process deems them not guilty, the prosecutors don’t just say “yo my bad”. Obviously, they only brought the case because they believed the person was guilty, so they still believe that. Hence why they’re disappointed when the judge/jury doesn’t see it that way. Personally, all that matters is that whatever evidence the prosecution has that he was guilty, it was not enough to persuade the court and he has been acquitted of these charges. What the prosecution thinks afterwards doesn’t matter, they lost and they can’t try him agains If there are open seats and aisle behind, airlines should consider automatically moving a minor traveling alone. There is a difference between Indian tourist groups vs people who live in a country and work there. Look it up harder. Its a non bailable offence, that lowkey means guilty till proven innocent Dude, i am trying to have a productive discussion. Don't pick a fight when it is not needed. Thanks for the info. One of my family friends has been a victim of a case like this, so I am definitely against it. From what I read about in a short time, it seems it is not 100% unbailable, and also the courts are trying to put in multiple checks to stop wrongful accusations that can ruin a man's life. It seems to me that the initial law was a reaction to the huge problem with dowry all accross the country, and now the officials are recognizing the damage it can cause and trying to align it with the \"innocent until proven guilty\" philosophy that a majority of our laws follow. So I stand by my statement that India follows the philosophy, just like USA, but I am not claiming that our consitution is perfect. I accept that there can be flaws in it. Don’t try to explain to me how and why DA prosecutes. You tried to say that DA is disappointed in same way as OJ’s prosecution. OJ had circumstantial evidence and was later found guilty in civil case. There was no direct evidence presented. In fact, there were no witnesses other than the 14 year old. The way you framed it, you are implying this man is like OJ and guilty except DA could not effectively prove. Bro, your comments are too advanced/smart for a lot of commoners. Yes, logically it seems a fair thing but a lot of people think too emotionally and that's where the problem begins. And on top of that a lot of people bring out their own traumas and insecurities in cases like these and feel like justice served to \"supposed\" perpetrators is justice served to them personally. Also, a few times people rally against rich to take out their frustration or place unwarranted anger. In my 7 years of talking on Reddit, I have met a lot of people who simply go with the flow, and follow the masses just to be relevant. How can you expect them to have an original thought? think critically on complex topics like these? His picture still up tho lol It was an overnight flight, so it was probably dark. I reckon it's entirely possible for someone to fondle themselves without anyone seeing. Maybe the guy's wife was asleep, he put the tray table down, and then it'd be very hard for anyone except the girl beside him to see anything. I took a long flight just recently, and really no one is paying that much attention to other people. They're either asleep, or watching movies. Combine that with her lack of full understanding of what she was seeing, and you could see how this could play out. And given this would ruin his career, there's no way he's not going to fight it with everything he has. Now, I don't know the details of the care, and won't claim that's what happened, but it is at least feasible. Once ur father/ brother or husband would be accused of a false case, you will understand how rare it is. And data suggests it isnt rare actually, Fake rape cases in India range between 50 to 75 percent. And we are not even considering the cases where the sexual relationship wasnt forced but due to silly laws was considered to be rape. For example if a man gets into a love affair and establishes sexual relationships with his sub ordinate junior woman, he can be charged for rape even if it is consensual in the first place. So the 50-75 percent data would be still considered a conservative figure. And don’t forget how devastating effects it can lead to someone’s life. No that’s not how I framed it. I gave you an example that just because a prosecutor loses the case, doesn’t mean they now stop believing the accused was guilty. Whether it’s OJ or some random person, doesn’t matter. Prosecutors are convinced they have caught the right man. They don’t change their position, the moment they lose their case. Think of it this way, if you claim you’re innocent and a jury finds you guilty, you would indeed be disappointed by the outcome. It’s that simple, don’t overthink it. >Who are trained exactly? The police who can be easily bought in this country? Or the corrupt judiciary who can _also_ be bought? Well too bad those are the only ones trained for this stuff. >I wish I had the faith _you_ have in our system. It's not a matter of faith. It's a matter of choice. We don't have a choice in a civil society. What's the alternative? Thr public? You? Me? Those are even worse. They don't even need to be bought. They can just be manipulated. For all it's flaws, our system is the best choice. We need to accept that while trying to improve it. Unfortunately that's how our world works huh? Whomsoever wrote this article is also a dick or a misandrist female keyboard warrior. The title of the article should be \"falsely accused\", poor journalism.. Who is the author?? aww spill it man big India energy move >both sexes face unique struggles, without turning it into a flaming battleground That's a good way to put it. No he means to say even if an adult woman would have made the accusations, they would still not publish her details. His point is valid. Cannot discuss the hypothetical bro. Girl was anon, which it should've been. Accused was not. It shouldn't have been. Anything else is should've would've could've. That's my take here. Yes, but that dude is saying is not incorrect and you can see it many other similar cases. Forget it man. She is most probably the type of person who supports \"no repercussions\" for false allegation cases. She is just trying miserably to look sesnible here. Racism against Indian people have gone up from getting murdered by homeless people or unknown people to tagging any middle east or south Asian person doing crime as Indian or fake news.. Indians everywhere outside India should be very careful now. I like how all the men in this post are saying new fear unlocked india truly is a backward place you can get a way with rape in India if you what to you know your not going to prison have fun. Indian men at clubs in NZ are horrifying and pester you even when you say no They used to say accused/alleged in the past. I dunno when they stopped. Downgrade of journalism quality in recent years. Like straight up manufacturing stories and situations Boys from Mumbai did commit rape, and there is a reason why bail was denied, are you a lawyer? Also most judges are men and men control judiciary, no ones out to get men🤦🏽‍♂️ well, at least he can wipe his tears with a million dollars Oh so you're blaming me now? Lol. Seriously, unreal. Wait until someone masturbates next to YOU on a plane, then do the 'right thing'. In us most of this accusations are made on brown people While robbery/ hit and run are made on black people Wasn't meant to blame you. I was wondering why would you chose to not report? Or how about not masturbating? >Maybe because it’s not the time and place? perfect example of shooting in your own argument You are quiet intelligent, how you figured out her type. Maybe. I have never been there. So I don't know. But I am pretty sure discrimination and racist people exist there. I was just making a logical statement. We don't know much about this particular case to conclude that this was an act of racism. Racism, casteism, etc are huge accusations that we should not use without proper evidence. Because when something like this happens, you make a split second decision, you don't analyse the situation from every possible angle and think it through and all that, you just react. For me, sex and masturbation isn't a big deal. My reaction was just to tell them to stop it and didn't think about it afterwards. What now makes me think I should report it next time is the fact that neither men were apologetic, in fact both of them reacted in an angry manner when I called them out (granted, I was pretty angry myself when I spoke to them). But they stopped and I carried on with my day, didn't think it was a huge deal that had to be reported. Bro you're right about presumption of innocence in criminal cases being followed in India. However in POCSO cases ( Protection of Children From Sexual Offences) there's presumption of 'guilt' that is, an accused person is said to be guilty until proven innocent. almost every family has a minor that doesnt mean they cant be sued Why? Well I am not from pakistan yet my friend had said me about this pakistani series called \"dunk\" which is basically based on such a scenario of a teacher. Creep This is why Social media trials shouldn't' happen and allow the police and law to take its course. So that an innocent person doesn't get punished. Unfortunately, most of the time, 'Men are guilty until proven innocent.' I haven't stated anywhere that the minor cannot be sued. If the doctor decides to pursue a defamation lawsuit in civil court, it's crucial to consider the risk that the court might not find any defamation. This could be particularly likely if there were no public statements made against the doctor outside of the legal context. A defamation case hinges on proving that false statements were made publicly, causing harm to the doctor's reputation. If these elements are not present or cannot be adequately demonstrated, the doctor's case may not succeed. Furthermore, initiating a defamation suit could inadvertently escalate the situation. It might prompt the other side, presumably the minor and their representatives, to file a civil suit for compensation against the doctor. In such a civil case, as previously mentioned, the threshold for proof is lower than in criminal proceedings. This means that while the criminal case didn't meet the high standard of 'beyond a reasonable doubt', a civil case requiring only a 'preponderance of evidence' could potentially be more problematic for the doctor. This needs to be weighed carefully by the doctor's legal team. The doctor's action, intended to clear his name and seek redress for defamation, could ironically lead to him facing a civil lawsuit with a more favorable burden of proof for the plaintiff. This situation could expose the doctor to significant legal and financial risks. Therefore, while a defamation suit is legally feasible, it carries the risk of public perception issues and extracting an emotional toll on the doctor and his family, but also the possibility of not achieving the desired legal outcome and inadvertently opening up a new legal battleground. A piece of advice. Don't say we have it here too when discussing some bad happening at somewhere else . white people does all the nastiest perviest stuff and try to make others look like a pervert! Yep he was I learnt something new today. I take back my point, because if this happened in India, this man would be destroyed regardless of the truth of the situation. Such a shame that because of criminals, innocent people have to suffer. Some teens love attention and make up scenarios in minds. They are cunning as they are innocent. Kids can be tricky and stuff comes out of their mouth can get you in deep trouble asthey don't think of consequences. The media has ruined this guys life forever doesn’t matter if found not guilty. He should sue each one of them. Not in all cases buddy. In some cases it's the other way round as far as i know. Yes, I learnt about that on this comment thread. Read the othr replies, you'll find the stuff about POCSO and my response to it. Indian origin ??? He is American. What racist shit Men are just asking for fair trials that doesn't mean women's protection or rights are going to get diluted. No one's saying women shouldn't be protected. Please try and understand the discussion before commenting. Yes i read that after commenting. 😂. So yes those are the some cases i was talking about. It's super scary to be a Man these days in India. Accurate. Who would?? Unless they’re a paedophile . He should sue them till they end up on the streets, the place they truly belong. Is it only applicable to marriages registered in India. Nirbhaya’s rapists (barring the juvenile) were hanged BECAUSE of the public outrage it created. So the alternative (public society) came in hand. How do you say WE improve the system? By working in the system? You & me enough to improve the system? The one you are talking to is a Hindu nationalist, and they will straight up lie to get their way. You are right! Some Hindu men absolutely do wear red dots (tika) or lines (tilak) on their foreheads as per their tradition. relax guys his fiànce was next to him🤡 The next time when you're throwing around colourful words like 'mudhead' make sure you aren't a nobhead yourselves, lol! 🤡 They sure will. They hate children Wtf wrong with these laws and shit nowadays I see these type of creep shit too Many tho It can also ruin people's lives/careers before any form of trial is held. Yeah it does look like a teen seeking attention first time hearing this enlighten me pls Nice, I saw this news yesterday and wondered how many would share the not-guilty verdict. My nephew is entering his tweens and I can se him always scheming and trying to do whatever he is told not to do lol. Pretty sure most of us were not different at that age. But going from mischief to harassing and falsely accusing others is a big step-up. Possibly a spoilt and coddled child who is used to playing pranks and bullying others. Probably the girl made it up for attention That's the IPC section 498A. Therefore, it only applies to marriages registered within the country. Your definition of a \"fight\" is severely distorted. There's no point elaborating on something so ubiquitous and well-known to these people. They are being deliberately obtuse here. Your mantra seems to be \"say less, convey lesser\" The news outlet is Indian…… loñ A person who doesn't want to engage with you isn't trying to fight you. Then again, that also explains why you didn't understand the implications of the Section 498A despite having seen cases first hand. A person who doesn't want to engage with someone on an anonymous forum has an easy way to do that. By not engaging. By commenting, you are engaging. And continue to do so. And it IS picking a fight when you reply to someone's genuine attempt at a conversation with a derisive remark, which doesn't lead to anything productive, and is nothing but an attempt to illicit a reaction. As it is clear for anyone reading this comment thread, I am not dogamtic. When someone pointed out POCSO, which actually asserts an assumption of guilt, I was perfectly capable of changing my mind. Your argument about 498A doesn't hold up, because it is not what you say it is. You are arguing about the IMPLICATION of a law, but that is not good enough. The bailable or non-bailable aspect of it doesn't necessarily imply assumption of guilt or innocence. How do we know this guy didn't actually do it? How do I know you don't go around groping randos in local buses? Forensics and jurisprudence can only go so far. > Is it fair to tag them for life even if no wrongdoing is proven? Every case has 3 possible outcomes - guilty, not guilty, innocent. If you propose relabelling these outcomes *that's* just semantics. You might win a defamation suit in the UK if the defendant cannot prove their defamatory accusations. USA, with stronger free speech laws, needs the defamation *accuser* to prove the defendant's speech false. I support the American approach here. Much rather prefer this to an outcome where victims of sexual assault, a crime with notoriously low conviction rates, are countersued when cases are dropped for lack of evidence. Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941 – August 28, 1955) was an African American boy who was abducted, tortured, and lynched in Mississippi in 1955 at the age of 14, after being accused of offending a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder and the acquittal of his killers drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the civil rights movement.[2] Already there's a movie based on this \"Jagten\" The Hunt. Lots of west people must gone mad & stereotyped indian once they seen indian in it. Lol. Okay, thank you for clarifying. Our mind displays strange responses for strange situations, I can understand it must have been such a situation. But like next to a minor?? Come on, normal people wouldn't do that This episode was the best family guy episode by the way Strange responses? Why is telling a man masturbating next to me to stop masturbating a strange response? BTW I don't think it's such a strange situation. I have seen enough men doing stuff like this in my life. > when something like this happens, you make a split second decision, you don't analyse the situation from every possible angle and think it through and all that, you just react. \"Strange response\" was in context of this statement you made above, and meant no malice. Fair enough. Actually if it does happen again, I think I'll just get my phone out to make a video of them first and then complain. Fuck these people. Thank you for understanding. > Fuck these people. Although I wish it doesn't happen with you - or anyone else, I certainly agree with you on this. Fuck'em. It’s not dumbass ie making shit up for your agenda OP’s got an agenda It is mf You definitely never left India No, it’s because this is an Indian publication and you guys are obsessed with us diaspora people This is Indian media and they only put his name and photo because you guys are obsessed with us diaspora people I have fool , I met both good and bad men , rose were racist ( quite few) but good people are more in no than that of racists . But still in my recent trip(2022) there I had more encounter with racists one in Texas and few in Nevada . Well I have lived here for decades and been to most states. Only somewhat experienced it 1-3 times ever but I chalk up to mostly cultural ignorance/difference I never said all of them are like that but in my 2018 visit there were 1-2 instances of racism again me but in my 2022 visit I had many encounter with racists at the same same place this seems like the no of racists mentality people have increased compared to before. And yes my distant relatives live there my aunt and her family are there in California they say there is a considerable Indian society s there and this type of things are low but in other states it's quite high . Who said she was white Most men in clubs are like that regardlessof ethnicity. Combine alcohol+ testosterone and that's a common consequence. On what basis On no basis at all. He's an Instructor of Med, Harvard Medical School. Sad that he had to go through this ordeal. So making shit up How can you say that they did commit rape if the judgement is not out yet? P.S. I don't know anything about the case as I have been living under a rock. The teen is suffering from mental health issues. Her grandparents should be sued for failing to understand the matter better with the teen. The grand parents are fully aware of the teen perverted mind. Men need to speak out and the media needs to address false claims against men. Good point my friend! Always take precaution. Boston is a city with red necks. I am living and working in Boston. Arrest first and ask questions later. The police and FBI should never have arrested this young doctor without fully vetting both the accused and the probable victim. FYI — I am professional. His face and name is all over the place .... \"Unnamed teenager\" >Nirbhaya’s rapists (barring the juvenile) were hanged BECAUSE of the public outrage it created. So the alternative (public society) came in hand. What? No. It wasn't due to public outrage. It was because India's justice system has not abolished the death penalty like other modern systems. Ideally they would have been given life sentences and left to rot in prison. So I'd not put much stock in your public outrage. >How do you say WE improve the system? By working in the system? By fighting for judicial reform. Things like abolishing the death penalty and change in guidelines for prosecuting such cases. It doesn't come easy. But being outraged will not change anything either. >You & me enough to improve the system? Well, with this attitude certainly not. Ofc you'd need more people but you have to use those voices in the right way."
