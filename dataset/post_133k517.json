        "Indeed….best of luck!",
        "Somebody help her. Such a good girl.",
        "Please help share the message.",
        "Yes sure I will share it with my friends ! Will let you know if anything positive.",

        "Thanks 😊",
        "Does she like really long walks / hikes? I live near the mountains and love jogging with my other female dog many km every day.\n\nI'm worried about adopting a desi if she might run off, happened to my current furball and only having an airtag on her collar allowed me to find her, I felt almost suicidal with worry.",
        "Oh desi dogs adopt pretty well to your schedule. A quote that i heard, in an alley, as an old couple walked their old dog with a grey snout & grey knees- “you rescue the dog once, the dog rescues you every-time, thenceforth”.\n\nGoodluck to you!🌻",
        "Ohh she loves to run and walk. However she isn't trained to walk off leash as of now. But, she didn't know to walk on leash till one month back and now here we are. She is a quick learner. Let me know and we can probably Chat over dm to know if its a good fit.",
        "Also, she is only 50% indie. She is 25% himalayan dog as well. I have never seen a dog as active as Barfi.",
        "> Barfi has been abandoned by her previous owners who neglected her for so long\n\nTime for people to file some case.",
        "Actually her case much more complicated than this. The owner kept her in abusive conditions. She was kept locked up for 15 hrs straight at ungodly hours. Never taken for walks, no routine. She stopped eating. Owners never asked to take her away but they didn't want her either. Neither wanted to make any efforts to take care of her. We had to rescue her because she wasn't taken care of. They never enquired back about her case.",
        "She's gorgeous! I hope you find a loving home for her like she deserves",
        "How is Barfi with other dogs? I have two already (both female) but would love to go through the process to see if we can bring home Barfi as well",
        "She is good with other dogs. But, takes little time to get friendly. Our female dog Shero and Barfi have become friends now. We can chat in detail over phone to know if it's right fit for you.",
