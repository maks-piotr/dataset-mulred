        "######Mookambika Temple is in Kollur, Udupi district, Karnataka. \n\n>Keralites have this intrinsic, invincible connection with the goddess from ancient days. The temple authorities, the hoteliers and the locals will vouch for this as around 60 percent of the devotees who throng the temple throughout the year are from the neighbouring state.\n\n[Malayalees and goddess Mookambika: The invincible link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theprint.in/india/malayalees-and-goddess-mookambika-the-invincible-link/1159209/%3famp)",
        "Wow",
        "Xenophobia at it's finest",
        "Utterly shameless fellows! Still you'll have right wingers losing breath when it's called a propaganda film.",
        "Mallu sanghis have come out of their closet. Itâ€™s not always that they get a chance to wear their brown chaddis and spread bigotry",
        "Ma => North indians not kannadigas posting this",
        "Disgraceful!!! \n\nIf the strength of your faith is dependent on the success of a movie, then you don't really have faith.",
        "It's Udupi, more radical and hindutvadi than many north indians",
        "This temple is in Kollur Karnataka and the banners are put up by the local Hindu Jagarana Vedike outfit made of Kannadigas, apparently at the temple entrance and around its premises.\n\nI'd say the most interesting thing here is not so much about Mallus but what it reveals about Kannadiga Hindus. Neither the temple authorities nor other Hindus there seem offended by this logic that says the only way to be a devout Hindu is through fear of Muslims, not through anything positive or spiritual about Hinduism itself.",
        "Please file a police complaint about spreading enmity",
        "Is there no law against this?",
        "Myre matram",
        "If I am in Congress I will place banners about joblessness and  lack of opportunities in higher education. The temple attracts parents of such folks.",
        "Keep propaganda films away from religious bodies.  Temples and religion are powerful self-sustainable bodies.",
        "~~State~~ Religion sponsored propaganda movie.",
        "Oh i thought this was in keralaâ€¦sorry about that",
        "State sponsored propaganda, wonder if this is what Hitler's Germany looked like",
        "It's apparently not too different? You could look how propaganda worked under Hitler's Germany. You'll immediately see the scary parallels.",
        "Hear me out. If u have watched inglorious basterds, u know what I mean. Replace that soldier/actor with Akshay Kumar. Perfectly fits in",
        "Apparently not! It requires a movie to reinstate faith in people.",
        "Mookambika khush hua!\n\n\n\nEdit: I'm sorry. I know it's insensitive. Par achha wordplay tha.",
        "Movie is art form , people will forget such movies in couple of years. e.g. nobody likes Rang de basanti now days... It's trendy thing.",
        "It did.",
        "Imagine having the awareness of a toddler.",
        "That's because the Sangh organizations like RSS, ABVP etc. were literally inspired by and modeled after similar fanatical groups that followed Hitler. The same goes for their playbook as well. Gujarat Pogrom and the more recent Delhi Pogrom follow the same pattern as the Kristallnacht.",
        "Temples are about belief and movies are about society. Society should not change your belief system.",
        "If you want your generations to stay away from BS, Watch \"The GUJARAT Story\"",
        "Iâ€™d think Ma Mookambika can make arrangements herself.",
        "On point.",
        "Who could be his lover/killer?",
        "Very sus that's it's written Ma Mookambika, and not Amme Mookambike",
        "I think even their uniform is inspired by the ones worn by the regular workers of the Nazi party and the Italian National Fascist Party.",
        "They would have liked it if it was Akshay Kumar playing Aamir Khan's character.",
        "True. also, only true patriot can truly understand last scene of RDB.",
        "80 se upar IQ na hoga aapka",
        "It's in Udupi district , one of the few districts which BJP swept completely in recent Karnataka elections.",
        "The irony",
        "Coastal Karnataka is the worst",
        "We will know that when the theatre of some propaganda premiere blows up.",
        "But kristallnacht was more of a purge of one faction of the nazi party, as the himmler sect of the party won the popularity contest.",
        "Teri family chali gayi kya usme?",
        "Shows how much  Karanataka has degraded over the years. Truly the UP of the South.",
        "Now start working for investigation agency you are good at it",
        "The very fact that you said nothing to the person who made word play with a hindu god but you have problems when i do the same with Alah, says a lot about your IQ. \nRhi baat meri IQ ki? It's definitely more than a madarsa chap.",
        "All in all. This move has made it two both of the eyes of a bull.\n\n1. Propoganda\n2. Sweet big money",
        "Man, this is the height of disrespect towards your own gods & Goddesses. And, we all know who can do this among the current parties. Anyway, whoever did this I don't understand how you can be considered of that faith?",
        "I was the one who made wordplay on the name of the hindu God and I make fun of all Gods and their prophets/godmen including your dear Allah.\n\nI belong to the shakta sect, a worphipper of Kali. \n\nAgain, IQ.",
        "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht\n\n> KristallnachtÂ or theÂ Night of Broken Glass, also called theÂ November pogrom(s)Â was aÂ pogromÂ againstÂ JewsÂ carried out by the Nazi Party'sÂ SturmabteilungÂ (SA) paramilitaryÂ andÂ SchutzstaffelÂ (SS) paramilitaryÂ forces along with some participation from theÂ Hitler YouthÂ and German civilians throughoutÂ Nazi GermanyÂ onÂ 9â€“10 November 1938. The German authorities looked on without intervening. The nameÂ KristallnachtÂ (literally 'Crystal Night') comes from the shards of broken glass that littered the streets after the windows of Jewish-owned stores, buildings andÂ synagoguesÂ were smashed.",
        "My bad, I got confused with this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives",
        "Has anyone seen the movie. Is it any good?",
        "Donâ€™t give them ideas man",
        "Hindutva has reduced hindus to just hating muslims. I donâ€™t even remember the last time someone talked about hindu values anywhere. Any movie related to religion ends into boycotts and controversy, any jokes on religion will send one to jail, any attempt to remind people of their own values will get you declared as anti-national. \n\nAnd they think someone else is eroding their culture.  ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",
