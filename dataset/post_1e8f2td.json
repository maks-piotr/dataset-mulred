        "Exactly. I actually am in favor of the judgment, he took a real risky route to deliver justice. We should have a Romeo Juliet clause in our POCSO laws.",
        "I'm not sure it's that black and white. Is there any way to ensure that the girl consents to this union? We don't know",
        "That's what the news says. That the mother of the child who was against their 'relationship' filed the case. The chap was dumb, he shouldn't have had sex with the minor, it's a different matter altogether. But if they were actually in love, sending him to prison would be the worst injustice.",
        "My sir, the \"girl's mother\" was against the relationship. Your own post quotes this. And if the girl did file the case (not sure how she can if she's a minor) then she ClEarLY doesn't want to be with him but needs child support which he absolutely OWES her.",
        "I meant the girl by child, in the previous comment. Also, minors can file a criminal case.",
        "There should be a subject in school called Hilao101. It literally would prevent rape and sex thoughts of men go away\nBeen doing it since 15 years now I am 30 y old.. I am able to concentrate on career and money and travelling thanks to this.",

        "In this case if the guy was 21 and the girl was 16 - would that still not qualify as statuory rape? I dont know what the legal age of consent in India is.",
        "I'm for such clause but 21 and 16 is too large of an age gap. Three years age gap is acceptable. Five years is too much. At 16, you're in PUC. At 21, ideally, you've started working. That's a vast difference in maturity and economic power.",
        "Did I read that right? She can't consent wtf is this judgement?",
        "I don't think 21 & 16 come under whatever romeo and juliet you're thinking of.. This looks like statutory rape.",
        "They say she was in late 16s. Idk about boy. But at 21 very few start working annd most likely you are in late 3rd/early 4th year of UG. You are not barely allowed drink in certain states in that age. Yeah, it is gross. But idk if it as easy to convict as in other cases imo. I'm not qualified enough to discuss morality/legaility of this, but if both were \"consenting\" then is it a crime big enough call it rape and destroy the future? Judge decided it is not, and I think it is complicated enough that I leave it to the judge..",
        "The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), 2012 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860 both peg the age of consent at 18 years.
