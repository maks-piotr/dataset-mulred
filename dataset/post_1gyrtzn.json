And there's nothing wrong with service sector driven growth which MMS era focused on - that is really sustainable in the long run and caters to the true aspirations of the country, used our strengths to our advantage, and it was truly atmanirbhar. It was a grave mistake to ignore that sector and take it for granted. Now FDI has moved to Vietnam and other sweet-spots due to multitude of factors. In the name of atmanirbhar, we're now begging foreign MNCs to set-up plants here and import labour from China for skills we don't have to satisfy the lust of certain cronies whose surnames start with A. You can lay all roads you want but you can't aspire the country to raise a generation of construction labour. Service sector was crucial for bridging that aspiration gap and raise the bar.",

These are **not** exclusive - that you should do only service or only manufacturing - basic logic is to play to your strengths. We had decent base in textile and pharma manufacturing - textile is even labour intenstive to generate employment but govt ignored it and went after capex heavy industries which take decades to build - and we can't compete with richer countries on the capex even.\n\nP.S: I know a **lot** about what I am saying so kindly do not waste my time if you're just going to troll and keep repeating the propaganda as facts.",

Also we are making more money but getting less new jobs sos there is jobless growth where the rich get richer but poor are stagnant. Also, the size of economy is very different before when you compared with now. If you think we haven't grown just count the no of hospitals, the no of new govt services, roads and many other infra projects which you can see that has increased a lot. Adani Enterprises If you read my comment again I never said anything negative about Motilal Oswal. Only that I did not know what or who that was and why should I trust them, the article failed to provide any description or link to the actual study. My complaint is about the journalism. Good to hear positives too. They are a stock brokerage. Electricity, Toilets, Homes, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Law & Order, Infrastructure... I wish this told us how much of the investment led to job creation. Like im aware they spent a shit load of money on the ram temple and a statue in gujarat of patel and for those popup stands with pictures of modi everywhere...how much of those trillions went into actually benefiting the citizens and not ego massaging is the trillion dollar question I think this is referring to Government and Private Capex. And it's a totally meaningless image. What was a the prompt - \"make an image about money\"? ðŸ’° 1. Is this in absolute value? Or adjusted for inflation? Given it's Motilal, I woudn't be surprised if they took absolute numbers. 2. This would be the trend if you take any decade in India and consider data till that point in time - we are a growing economy so if growth is compounded since independence at this rate, obviously much more stuff has to take place recently. We also had millions invested in misinformation, propaganda, personal publicity for some leaders, kickbacks for cronies, controlling media, certain unnecessary statues and buildings, horse-trading of elected leaders and the list goes on. You read Andy Mukerjee's articles on how this govt has mismanaged economy and how Arvind Subramanian, their own CEA who worked with them raised questions on GDP numbers. The growth we are seeing now is not driven by fundamentals - it's driven by growth of cronies and someday the bubbles' gonna burst. And there's nothing wrong with service sector driven growth which MMS era focused on - that is really sustainable in the long run and caters to the true aspirations of the country, used our strengths to our advantage, and it was truly atmanirbhar. It was a grave mistake to ignore that sector and take it for granted. Now FDI has moved to Vietnam and other sweet-spots due to multitude of factors. In the name of atmanirbhar, we're now begging foreign MNCs to set-up plants here and import labour from China for skills we don't have to satisfy the lust of certain cronies whose surnames start with A. You can lay all roads you want but you can't aspire the country to raise a generation of construction labour. Service sector was crucial for bridging that aspiration gap and raise the bar.

I don't see how that's any different from congress government though; atleast this way some development is getting done Will do. Always good to have both perspectives Gun to my head I haven't seen this scale of weaponizing digital media and misinformation before. then what do you like about the party you vote for The service sector cannot employ many people particularly from an uneducated background. Service sector also doesn't help us develop technology. Service sector is not just IT. Service sector creates additionality wherein domestic services also grow catering to these people, which is what happened previously. Service sector doesn't stop us from developing technology - we started off as IT services and are able to deliver best in class original SaaS product companies today. That's the starting point. In any scenario, raising a generation of construction labour is not going to help you develop technology nor is it aspirational. I stop here. Most educated people support industrialization in the first service sector and the development approach. Technology is not only about software. It is about hardware also. You really cannot create hardware technology without having strong manufacturing. We cannot create enough white collar jobs. This is why there is a push needed for a blue collar job. You cannot put a cart before the horse. >Most educated people support industrialization in the first service sector and the development approach. Most educated people support investing in education and skill development first. Instead of simply thinking throwing capex would generate industrial growth - if throwing money solves the problem, rich countries would have been easily able to do it. These are **not** exclusive - that you should do only service or only manufacturing - basic logic is to play to your strengths. We had decent base in textile and pharma manufacturing - textile is even labour intenstive to generate employment but govt ignored it and went after capex heavy industries which take decades to build - and we can't compete with richer countries on the capex even. P.S: I know a **lot** about what I am saying so kindly do not waste my time if you're just going to troll and keep repeating the propaganda as facts. Ok."
