    "selftext": "\nSo last year around Diwali (Nov 2023), I was travelling via Indian railways. It was a long journey (24hr +). Now I usually get food poisoning from the food that you get from stations or on train so I ordered rajma chawal for dinner on ‘food on track’ App by Indian railways. I didn’t have any change with me so I paid through my HDFC CC  thinking if anything goes wrong, Hdfc will have my back (big mistake). For those who don’t know, credit card issuers promise to save you in case the service is not provided via ‘chargeback’. \n\nNow as you can guess, my dinner was never delivered. I didn’t have lunch either so an aunty sitting beside me (god bless her) felt sorry for me offered some home made bhindi sabzi. If it wasn’t for, I’d have been in an ‘involuntary 24 hour intermittent fasting’ and ‘involuntary 8 hours in ketosis’. \n\nAs soon as I reached my destination, I complained in the app. Now, here is where I was introduced to the great Indian system of incompetence and exploitation. \n\n1. The number for complaints provided in the app doesn’t work 🤡\n\n2. When I emailed them, the MANUALLY CHANGED delivery status to ‘delivered’ in the app. It blows my mind how they can lie blatantly on customer’s face.🤡\n\n3. They emailed me back saying your order was delivered (even tho I never got the food and never shared my OTP)🤡\n\n4. After getting scammed by sarkari babus, I requested chargeback from hdfc. After one month of filing the complaint they closed it without any explanation. 🤡\n\n5. Reopened my complaint in Jan 2024. Didn’t receive any updates for 6 months.🤡\n\n6. After 6 months, I get an update saying they have “7 page proof” that my food was actually delivered. Their so-called proof is just the bill.🤡\n\nI have attached SCs of the bullshit they call proof for you guys to enjoy. \n\nAfter that I had an hour long argument with hdfc employees who were obviously of no help. \n\nI have gotten over my small loss but what boils my blood to this day is how every part of the system lies on your face and tries to gaslight you. It’s honestly fascinating how everyone, from the delivery man to railways customer service to app developers to hdfc bank all work together to fuck with the common folks of this country. \n\n\n\n",

Sometimes it might work as an exception\n\n  \nIndia is one of the few countries where OTP's are mandated for 100% of transactions, AFAIK there are a few more.

        "Yeah, but they are supposed to work if the service was not provided too. I am paying extra for CC use as you can see in the bill. I could’ve used upi as well.

        "As someone with experience in dealing with chargebacks handled by banks, let me tell you the process. Whenever a chargeback is raised by the issuing bank, it gets sent to the acquiring bank (the merchant's bank). The acquiring bank in turn sends the transaction details to the merchant for which the chargeback was raised. In most of the cases it's actually a payment gateway such as Razorpay or Bill desk that the acquiring bank contacts not the final merchant which in your case is Rebel foods. In this scenario the payment gateway folks that handle chargebacks just check if the payment was successful or not and do not even contact the final merchant if the service was delivered or not. That's why simply the generation of the receipt is considered as fulfillment of service, which is wrong. \n\nIf a chargeback is rejected by the acquiring bank, then issuing bank can raise a pre-arbitration, which based on the screenshots is what has been done. Pre-arbitration is an escalated form of chargeback where the merchant has to provide the proof of the service. Ideally at this level the payment gateway probably contacted Rebel foods and they too just gave the receipt of order and the same was just passed along. In most cases they maintain a delivery log which wasn't there. That would have been a hard evidence of delivery. \n\nYour next course could be to raise an arbitration which is the highest level of escalation. Here, Mastercard will handle the whole case and if they deem that the services were not delivered based on the proof shown by the acquiring bank, they will ask the bank to refund the amount along with some penalties. However issuing banks rarely raise arbitration. But do try this route as you have nothing to lose.",
