And if they sell the ticket at a lower price earlier, they will definitely get that extra amount out of you by randomly changing your flight or giving bullshit excuses as to why they cannot let you on the current flight. A throwback to my childhood rail journey when I used to hear impromptu group singing and Antyakshari in 2nd class compartments. This takes it up (pun) a whole new level! Is it in Indigo or just we the crowd became worse they would be lynched in plane Hahaha … keep it up They charge a bomb equivalent to Air India and claim themselves as low cost airlines. Money wise they're not low cost Service wise yes they're a fking low cost airline.. Agreed to your statement Indigo Railways Now that there's no difference between Indigo flights and the general compartment of local trains, Indigo should reduce its ticket prices. Dude that's by default. UAPA lag jayat, bulldozer chal jata aur saari 2-3 alphabet agencies unke peeche pad jati. But what about the other passengers who aren't interested in listen to Dholak Bhajans mid-air... Even on trains, I have seen passengers playing songs on cell phones at full blast. Just no sense of the privacy of others And they complain about Noise pollution from mosques. :( Something or the other always happening with IndiGo Even in the most hype religious gulf states the airlines limit religiosity to a short overhead dua/prayer for safe travel prior to take off. Saudia has a very tiny prayer area (2-3 ppl max) on their larger planes. > Congress wants to increase reservation Haryana BJP government had introduced 75% reservation back in 2020. &nbsp; In the private sector, no less. &nbsp; Just so you know. Dont you know leave religion at home is meant for only one specific conmunity.. Lmaoooo They should not complain about kids crying on plane then tru 😤 Had this same experience in a vistadome train cabin last week with a big group of people banging tiffins and singing bhajans off tune for hours. The tickets for the 5 hour train journey cost Rs.1000 and were the most expensive ones available on that leg. Journey completely ruined by those people. End of the day our people don’t have any civic sense or manners so we can never have nice things. Basic manners and morals should be compulsory taught in schools. Sadly making a successful airline in India is very hard. That's not correct. Please don't victimise it. Travel in vistara Indigo was pretty bad before itself. Now it seems to have gotten extra worse The worst thing to happen to India is people with absolute no class getting money. So that means I can carry my bluetooth speaker in flight and play Metallica on it, right? People singing in a plane that’s specifically going to a spiritual destination, which means 99% of the pax are going on the same purpose. Yeah, big surprise. These news outlets will make an issue out of every damn thing. Calm the f down seriously Jin haraamzaadon ko train mein phone ki phati speaker pe gaane sunne se gaand phat ti thi aaj wohi airplane mein dhol tamashe ko sunke gaand hilaane ko tayyar hain. &#x200B; TRANSLATION - The bastards whose asses used to get torn by the sound of blasting music from dilapidated speakers of phone on train, today the same bastards are twerking their asses on Dhols in an airplane. Right. Buddha Parcel Didn't know Indigo flew between CST and Kalyan. Feeeligu paravd My goodness, can’t you guys stop playing victim card? Not even once? What exactly is victimised here? The fact that you are indirectly imposing your beliefs on someone who is travelling with you and spoiling your peace? Airplane ride should be a peaceful one because some already face too much of physiological changes on flight. Oh boy.....wait no!! Im fine with all this. IF they give me a 4-5k discount, I will glady hear all the bhajans!! First rule of extended distance travel is shut the **** up and don’t annoy your fellow passengers. This needs to be instilled. Enjoy your bhajans via headphones I am from South India. Here local Christian community do \"Mera Yesu Yesu\" often and stick all posters related to Bible, often distributing Bibles and doing cheap things in the name of religion like Non followers are worshipping Shaitan , only Jesus is truth etc etc ... I am got irritated by these people. gullu media would have been showing 9-11 images and calling it aeroplane jihad Thats absolute correct.. if a muslim does that , they would have had their houses bulldozed, experts on new channels would have been explaining how dangerous it was for air safety.. 24/7 all main media covering I guess it would have been equally controversial if the crew had stopped Ram Bhajan... The times we're in it's messy in any situation... Aakhir hm karein to karein kya bole to bole kya... Wah Modi ji wah! I mean they are true to their brand of replicating the Mumbai local experience.. why slam them.. next step would be to introduce standing tickets i mean technically speaking, a bunch of people shouting in the plane midair will still contribute less over all pollution noise wise compared to the plane engines. not encouraging, just saying its like complaining of dog barks when you wake up by bomb sirens oopsie, harmless occasion celebrate kia. aab clown bolenge log There was a report on surveillance through DigiYatra and Adani with his airports have major stake in it. The common process is now made harder so people opt for DigiYatra. Cheaper rates than other flights will do that Are you really that dumb? I replied to the above comment that said : > leave religion at home is meant for only one specific conmunity. Which ONE SPECIFIC is he talking about? And are you sure? Because that ONE SPECIFIC community is allowed to use loud speakers just like any other religion or to gather in public, on roads, block traffic during prayers just like on other major religious day of other religions. Stop saying that ONE SPECIFIC community has less rights because they don’t, in fact they have a lot lot more schemes they get under minority status. \"It's common\" lmao be fr. There is noise pollution for everyone in the flight. They can't even escape anywhere. Actions like this will only make people feel averse towards Hinduism. Anyone who wants to do good for Hinduism must shut the fuck up. That's the biggest favour. With bullshit crew What law was being violated for DGCA to take action? Had any of the fellow passengers put an official complaint, that was a different case. See. If Indigo did stop them from singing bhajan, people would have slammed them for stopping people from singing bhajan(would definitely bring religion into it. It’s very risky to do the right thing as you never know what will irk the public and in the culture of boycott they are just trying to save themselves. Yes you are absolutely right, however someone needs to stop this over enthusiastic buggers Yes absolutely. Flights are for comfort and peace. There should be a standard maintained as the flight ticket price is itself a standard."
