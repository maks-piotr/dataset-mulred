    "selftext": "Dear Redditors,  I recently stumbled upon a distressing video depicting an individual from a higher caste treating someone from a lower caste in a manner that was deeply unsettling (NSFW Link Below). This has lead me to question the continued existence of such behavior in today's society. I understand that the caste system, with its deep historical roots, has been a part of many cultures not only India but also other parts of the world, but I'm somewhat taken aback to see such explicit discrimination still apparent in the modern world and in a such country that will become a global powerhouse in few decades. Like how someone can do such thing?\n\nIs this kind of caste-based discrimination still a prevalent issue in certain regions? If yes, what Indian government is doing to destroy this culture rooted discrimination? Could anyone shed light on why these attitudes persist despite global advancements in human rights and societal understanding? \n\n[https://twitter.com/ConflictTR/status/1676896628823715840](https://twitter.com/ConflictTR/status/1676896628823715840)  \\- NSFW ",

        "It is a common occurrence in India. Much worse shit has happened here for the last 3000 years. Most Indians are pathetic losers who get their high by demeaning others. That's what all the unity in diversity is all about. \n\nTrading insults, humiliating the next in line, etc, etc is how we keep our country in order. So there's either the Chinese model of homogeneity or the Indian model of venting out for a country with as huge a population as ours.",

Unfortunately some people simply refuse to give up their centuries old mentality, there are laws to prevent it. But people use influence and power to position themselves above the law, especially in rural areas.",

One that doesn't first side with the perpetrator against the victim in absence of social media pressure. Then swings to the other extreme by bulldozing the perpetrator's home without a trial or respect for basic rights.

        "Discrimination existed long before reservation existed. Reservation is necessary to bring the average financial prowess and social prestige of lower castes up to the level of upper castes. Only then will discrimination stop, because in India money and social prestige are the only antidotes for the arrogance of upper castes.",

If someone doesn't know much about the country, how do you tell them that \"there are progress in the right direction and people a lot of people no longer believe  in caste systems but at the same time it's not solved or eradicate\". I feel like he conveyed this pretty well through his statement. I don't think the president and prime minister fact is meant to side step the issue which what you maybe thinking",
        "Good answer. One nitpick - In India there is quota (reservations)for scheduled tribes, scheduled cast and other backward cast in college admissions, government jobs and in job promotions. College admissions quota is almost 50% of all seats. Quota is different from affirmative actions, as done in the US.",
        "Obviously not. Braille, just like caste based reservation, is an aid not a cure.",
        "Caste based reservation is a political tool to get votes. Politicians will try to keep this vote bank and thus it is in their favor to keep them poor and backward.\nWe have politicized caste.\nPeople can't be equal, unless you treat them equal.\nReservation should always have been economically based.",
        "Let's say a white man represents America and says racism is a thing of the past. It was deeply rooted in our history, but in this modern age, it is a thing of the very distant past. With modernism, it has deteriorated. See, he would be a white man representing the whole.\n\nJust like that, a narrative is in place that caste is a thing of the past. This narrative is preached by those who deny caste to avoid taking responsibility and to save face in the eyes of the world. It is a facade, and I think it has worked well. It denies casteism is there. Many are unaware due to this\n\nJust like slavery was a thing of the past when it was outlawed, its roots have survived as racism today. People are still marginalized and brutalized. Similarly, untouchability was a thing of the past because it was outlawed, but it still lives on as casteism. However, in India, it is not just cultural but also a religious thing. People can't identify with relegion without their caste from my experience, but  it is not exclusive to certain religion(Hinduism that has origins). Now People of every religion practice casteism ( like islam and Christianity). \n\nEven though untouchability is banned, marriages are still largely caste-based, people want to know your caste before renting an apartment, and people tend to mingle more easily only if they are of the same caste. The first thing people want to know about others is their caste.\n\nYes, there are people who do not care about caste, but they are a minority.\n\nCasteism is as prevalent as racism and communalism. In fact, casteism shares characteristics of racism as well as communalism. All three are identity-based. I think they are the same with some distinct differences. The very root is the same. Even black peyple faced untouchability ( apartheid)\n\nSadly, caste has reached abroad. It is now a modern issue. Yes, caste is a problem not only in India but also in the entire Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc.) itself. Caste is  a subcontinent problem.\n\n\nGovernement of elected by people who advocate for communalism. Yup communal politics works here.\nCaste consciousness is there. Its people identity. That's the reason for casteism. People identify with caste and they cant think without it. \n\nIf you're on the internet, you just need to search for caste-based discrimination and atrocities to find information about them. And the thing discrimination is one thing horrendus atrocity  is another both are prevelant though outlawed. And they are on the rise with the rise of hindutva ideology in india.",

The person is arrested and govt is doing what all it can under law to punish d culprit.\nLarger question is is it common? IMO, it's there but it's decreasing...\nWhy it's there? It's actually everywhere. In India it might b caste based, here u also have religion based. In west it's race based , religion based. \nU also see incidents of well to do ppl, educated ppl doing same.when drunk in flights... \nSo, it's about behaviour.\nMany wise ppl say , that as a human - if v become true human is also more than enough.",
        "I belive the reservation shall exist for the poor, not the ones going to Coachings and private tutions, but rather for the ones who do not have those privilege. Honestly, my batch was fulled with SC/ST students, and the were proudly and openly lax that they would find a good college due to it, and they did too, I was also in OBC category, so yeah that applies on me as well. But long story short, I believe reservations shall be for the underprivileged rather than the SC/STs.",

        "Also, The CM of the state remarked, a criminal has no caste or religion. Alas, you can never separate these from the victim and culprit.

        "Indian society has been run on the basis of caste system for probably thousands of years. The British came and generally gave jobs on basis of caste. This further depended the divide. \n\nWhen india finally got its independence, it was pretty much unanimously agreed among our freedom fighters that the evils of this caste system must be dealt away with. A lower caste person in Dr. Bhima Rao ambedkar drafted our constitution and discrimination on basis of caste was made a criminal offence.\n\nI think in 1992 on basis of report of mandal committee reservation in colleges for lower caste was given. But this  has added to resentment now a general category student like me has to score very high marks as compared to a person with reservation. This reservation is like 50 percent of total seats. \n\n40 percent of seats in lok sabha have also been reserved for sc/st and many political leaders like Lalu Prasad yadav raised issues and supported the lower caste people. The current president of India is also from sc/st community. Casteism is still rampant in states like Bihar which is also the most poor state in India.\n\n It takes time to change people:s ideologies and in india an unfortunate thing has happened unlike in western countries where internet has helped to reduce discrimination and where if you were caught using a casteist slur on tape it can probably ruin your life in india it is being used as a tool to further spread hate against Muslims especially and to a lesser extent against lower caste",

        "The caste system has been abolished by the government. But that doesn't mean that it has been eradicated once and for all.\n\nUnfortunately this still exists but in rural villages and districts. It is not widely seen tbh.\n\nThere are still small sects that practise it or choose to practise it as and when they want to.\n\nFor example, there's a marriage proposal for a girl from the boys side. The parents might be okay with the marriage and given the go ahead. But there still might be people in the village who might not want a lower caste boy marrying an upper class girl in the village. People might raise an objection and create a ruckus. In their minds, this marriage will set a precidence/an example for future.\n\nThese people try to hold on to the caste system and use it as and when it suits them. They do it to remain in power and show their superiority and dominance in the community. They might be literally useless otherwise but it's a way to maintain dominance.\n\nThe government has programmes for the lower caste people like SC (scheduled caste) and ST (Scheduled Tribes) in terms of education and employment. There are quotas for such people in the system.\n\nI need you to understand that this is not accepted by the majority of the population. My dad comes from a rural village in South India and there is no caste system prevalent there atm. None at all. It was prevalent in the early 80's and I remember it as a child.\n\nPls understand that this is headline news - because it's abt demeaning someone because of his (lower) caste by someone who is the son of a politician. A small time politician I believe but still one. His son assumes that he is some big sh1t and can do as he likes.\n\nThe accused has been arrested from what I read last and charges have been filed.\n\nAgain, the majority of the majority does not support this prejudice. Sadly it's still prevalent in the rural villages. The law isn't apt enough to catch every crime while/before it happens. We have our issues which is ours and our own. It is what it is but it will fade away soon - things take time sometimes. Justice shall always prevail.",

        "(Apologies for the long read)\n\nHi, yes it continues and is very prevalent in almost entire India. One might argue that urbanism deprecates casteism and it holds true in Indian context. However the reality is that urbanism camouflages casteism through indirect action rather than direct. There are various researches you can easily google. \nHaving academically researched on the issue of caste and the benefit of reservation (affirmative action of sorts), I can tell you one of the most prominent reasons for continuation of caste system. It is a malpractice of our culture.\n\nThe original and authentic culture of hinduism provided for fluid social identities based on occupation. That is to say, A garbage collector would be at a lower strata of social identity (called a shudra). But if his son/daughter studies and becomes a teacher, he would not be identified as a Shudra but rather a Brahmin (top most social identity). This was the original varna system in the early vedic times.\n\nHowever, through corruption of minds in the later vedic age and colonial brits manipulating varna system into a caste system; it became a birth based system where you must carry the social identity of your ancestors (primarily paternal). This is why reservation system was introduced by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.\n\nPlease keep in mind that reservation is not a poverty alleviation scheme where it does not mean that if a person entitled to benefit becomes financially sound then they should not get the benefits. This is because even at a joint secretary level in India, people from these communication do face caste discrimination on a routinely basis. People are still murdered for marrying a higher caste person or even venturing nearby a temple. \n\nAnother very crucial reason for continuation of casteism is lack of intellect. I am not talking about lack of education, but about intellect. A majority of Indian population is quick to be influenced. Technology and provocative notions being propagated fuels in to this enmity. Same is indirectly promoted by governments too (both current and previous ones)\n\nThe only solution is that someone comes to power who makes it their life goal to educate people on this issues and punish where necessary. Then maybe in 2 or 3 generations, we might not have casteism and in turn, no need for reservation system. However, reservation system is not the cause but the remedy. Caste based mentality has to go first before reservation system goes.",
        "Fuck. That sounds like something Jaggu would say. üíÄ",
        "no? reservation was never created to ‚Äúsolve casteism‚Äù. it was created to have equal representation. which it is successful in doing. that‚Äôs it.",
        "Reservation was a patchwork temporary solution at best. If it were working there would not be a need to justify its existence time and again. Representation for the socially discriminated is important but if you aren't going to educate everyone and remove the ideas of caste from people's minds, it's an incomplete solution. Reservation was a first step towards that but now it is nothing more than a tool for division that needs to be overhauled or incidents like these will keep on happening again and again and again. Why? Because reservation does not spread awareness. Reservation has to be like the first step of a 12 step program to fix these problems in our society. But because of some very divisive figures in our political history, it has just become a tool for gathering votes from communities.",

Thanks downvoters. \n\nHonestly that's just how most South Asians work.For example, If you go comment on r/indianmuslims the mod will just block you if you give an opposing view. The same  is true of Pakistanis, Lankans and Burmese. All these folks literally thrive by ostracising communities, by using mental harassment techniques to make the other submit. \n\nIn the western fringes, even to a certain extent violence and direct confrontation was historically used to assert dominance of a class over other. In South Asia, it is a lot of mind games, so they end up doing things like pee on a man, convert a woman, or do some other shit. Because they are children of losers who ran away from the West and migrated towards the East over millenia. And that loser gene hasn't faded away. They are still carrying it to this day. (Sarcastic undertones, but kinda true) \n\nNow I am not saying every Indian is like that. But since it is a part of our 'culture' even the most well meaning of us intentionally or unintentionally does end up doing things that I mentioned. \n\nAnd that means that sometimes I do it too.

Why have there not been social revolutions in India, is a question which has incessantly troubled me. There is only one answer which I can give, and it is that the lower classes of Hindus have been completely disabled for direct action on account of this wretched caste system. They could not bear arms, and without arms they could not rebel. They were all ploughmen - or rather, condemned to be ploughmen - and they never were allowed to convert their ploughshares into swords. They had no bayonets, and therefore everyone who chose, could and did sit upon them. On account of the caste system, they could receive no education. They could not think out or know the way to their salvation. They were condemned to be lowly; and not knowing the way of escape, and not having the means of escape, they became reconciled to eternal servitude, which they accepted as their inescapable fate.\"\n\n\\- 17.5, Annihilation of Caste, An Undelivered Speech, 1936; Dr. B.

For instance, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 which is used widely by the police to take required action against any and all atrocities against SCs. \n\nThat said, these provisions still have to be executed to its fullest extent but I think more than that, there is a need for a collective mindset shift. \n\nI hope whoever this idiot is, gets punished to the fullest extent of law.\n\nedit: \nimo, there are multiple reasons/angles as to why despite global advancement in the understanding of human rights, we still have something as disgusting as caste discrimination still alive:\n- lack of awareness \n- socio-political reasons (politics surrounding castes)\n- cultural reasons (religion, customs, etc that have promoted discrimination \"varna system\" from centuries)\n- rigidity to change among the even educated ones \n- colonial hangover (which has given Indians a weird inferiority but superiority complex), and there are multiple other reasons that I'm sure I've missed. \n\nIn any case, it's sad and aggravating to say the least and it needs to change asap.

I've spent over a year visiting India, but in that time I have always shied away from asking about the issue because when I have asked, it has always seemed to make people uncomfortable.  So I've generally remained quiet out of a desire to be respectful and polite and not make waves.    \n\nAnyway, this might be my chance to blurt out my potentially blunt queries.  I don't mean to be rude.  It's just that caste is a part of Indian culture that is largely invisible to foreigners like me.  \n\nI know that a person's caste is often obvious to locals by surname.  But not always??  I don't understand how surnames may or may not indicate caste.  \n\nI also find myself wondering how people know about one another's caste when at the end of the day caste is a social construct.  By that, I mean caste is not obvious in the material presence of a person, but something which is signified by social means.  \n\nSo, other than surnames, can anyone give me some examples of what those social means are?  I have had interactions where I have been painfully shown someone's thread.  (Yawn.)  Are there other ways that people commonly use to display OR hide their caste?  Jobs?  Linguistic habits?  Clothing?  Prohibitions?  Other specific displays?  \n\nDo people ask probing questions to discover another's caste when it's not obvious?  Explicitly?  Subtly?  On paper?!  \n\nHow do people know other people's caste *at all*?\n\nMany, many years ago when I was still barely an adult, I stayed on the property of a \"high\" caste individual who kept me segregated from his personal domicile.  At some point, I realized I was excluded from his pure space because I was a foreigner and my presence would pollute his personal space.  (I was invited into his premises once, and thereafter they were cleaned.)  I don't know how to say this, but he was NEVER deliberately rude or unfriendly to me and was ALWAYS absolutely kind to me ....  \n\nBut fuck that. üòÅ\n\nIt's a type of prejudice we can ALL do without.  \n\nüë™",

I've seen first hand what happens to a lot the first generation people who get in through reservation into the premier institutes and then struggle till they drop out or kill themselves. I've almost killed myself too so I know how hard it can get. Force selection is not the answer. The answer is education from the primary level that can make the downtrodden capable of growing and taking back what they lost. Reservation was just a temporary measure. It needs more policies to replace it slowly. I mean honestly this system is just a joke now. Groups of people who can agitate and destroy public property hard enough have been getting reservations despite their socio-economic stature. You want me to reduce my aspirations, my dreams because my ancestors were fucking idiots? And it's just in 70 years time 3 generations have been educated, joined the workforce and retired and yet this system has not been able to create awareness about the problem.

It still is larger than the vast majority of people in India tho. And also, I come from a village in a state that the majority of people would consider too underdeveloped, even by Indian standards.

What kind of justification is that. \n\n> Assuming someone is a ‚Äúfatty eating pizza‚Äù for using reservations is absolutely a generalisation, especially when using your personal anecdotes to do so \n\nAgain, that was an example in the language *you* started.

        "I am no messiah and also not a socio-political thinker who has the data required to devise such a cure. The government hasn't even done a caste census for decades so nobody has any factual information. Therefore, I just have some theories.\n\n1. Encourage people to freely choose surnames while registering birth. Yes, it is available already but most don't even have an idea that it is doable. Better yet, identify caste based surnames and abolish their usage in official documents.\n\n2. Encourage inter-caste marriages by removing unnecessary protocols about declaring intention of marriage months prior. Make the process fast, easy, and accessible to register marriages under the Special Marriage Act.\n\n3. Stop the police from harassing the inter-caste or inter-religious couples once the couple states their wish to marry in a police station or court and force the police to provide them protection. Stop registering third party complaints in the case of marriages (only the families of the couples should be allowed to register FIRs if they suspect ill intentions and those should only be acted upon if the couple themselves fail to testify their intentions in front of the police or the court).\n\n4. Invest in quality subsidised education in regions with higher population from the reserved categories and teach them in their mother tongue wherever possible. Make laws and govt circulars available in the vernacular of all groups of people in every state. This is required to ensure social mobility.\n\n6. Do a caste census and only award reservation to the various backward groups in positions where there is a serious issue of representation. No reservation for the dominant castes in any region. While it was initially necessary for reservation to be a political move, it is high time to decouple it from politics and make it data oriented. This is rather controversial but I see no other way to stop the random agitations demanding reservations without any basis in recorded facts. This way if representation is fixed, reservation can be taken away from that position for the particular group.\n\nThere is a single assumption behind these measures:\nEach sufficiently large group of people is equally meritorious (on average) and thus if the socio-economic classes were truly merit based, they would have equal (with some random deviations as is the nature of all statistical data) representation throughout.",

        "Caste based system is still there,\nI belong to a very very rural place in Barmer, Rajasthan. I‚Äôm not a active resident and visit there couple of times in a year. \nI have studied in a very good education system that keeps me from any caste based thinking but I am a science person and I have my own problem to solve, so I don‚Äôt rebel in my village and let them be how they want to be.\n\nI‚Äôm explaining what happens there, not what I believe in. I have lived with people from different backgrounds without asking them their caste. But when I‚Äôm in my village I have to behave according to the culture and traditions there.\n\nThe people from other caste‚Äôs when they visit my home will be treated differently based on their caste. I‚Äôm giving some examples here that will give you enough insight.\n\n1. Meghval, Bheel caste or Muslims or any other caste which is considered lower - They are our neighbours and they mostly visit our house for day labour. We don‚Äôt shake hands with them but we do greet them with a big smile. When serving them tea, drinks or food, we have separate utensils for them that are kept in bags, Meghvals and Bheels have different bags utensils and Muslims have different. They can enter our house but only to the mens sitting area. That too they will enter to a limit, there will be a shed in not too inside and not too outside area where we will offer them a clean sheet to sit.\nWe don‚Äôt ask any visitor the purpose of visit, whatever the caste maybe, without offering them water and a place to sit. If the visit is long enough to make tea, then we will offer tea. \n\nVery Important point here - From my observation I have found that, there is no caste lower than us which is pure vegetarian(cattle milk but no eggs). So this utensils thing is purely based on that.\nBut people from higher caste if they are non vegetarian, we have to treat them as equals because from old times they were considered as bad people, they used to kill lower caste people like us if they find anything disrespectful.\n\n2. Lower caste from different state, or some government official - Here the village mind can‚Äôt process what to do and they forget caste discrimination and they are treated them like equals. \nBut some senior officials who have seen discrimination in their times would themselves ask us not to serve in our utensils and then they will get the bag of separate utensils.\n\n3. Equal or higher caste but assumed to be a non vegetarian person - People from my caste don‚Äôt like visits from them because they have to offer their own utensils and they dislike it. Sometimes keeping the serving dishes aside to be properly washed outside the house.\n\n4. In my Gurus house - my guru who is trained by other guru‚Äôs from my region, doesn‚Äôt believe in caste system and inside his premises there is no discrimination based on it.\n\nBUT TIMES ARE CHANGING -\nWhat i have explained above is changing and will last no more 2 generations if the elders don‚Äôt force their thinking onto the younger ones. \n\nWhat if someone doesn‚Äôt discriminate others based on caste -\nIf the news gets out, other people, relatives etc will warn you and if the same continues then they will remove your family from samaaj(idk what its called, community?) and no one from your samaaj will be allowed to visit your house and you will also be banned to visit them. There are more factors in play here. If you are married in your community then your father in law will be actively pushing you not be a rebel if he believes in caste system. \nSo the pressure builds up and most people don‚Äôt do this.\n\nThere is a lot more i could write, but you can ask me anything and I‚Äôll respond.",

Keep holding blinded stereotypes and call everyone who doesn't agree with you casteist. \"But you don't agree with me, you must be evil\" smooth-brained idiot.   \n\n> P.S.

        "I‚Äôm from Earth and love you both. Wait, you don‚Äôt sound terribly genuine, and in fact you‚Äôre assuming the OP is being racist rather than being curious and young, or someone like me with mild neurocognitive disorder after TBI, I cherish the connections to the world I‚Äôm given because most of my life is spent boxed in by vicious discrimination in the subterranean collective subconscious. It‚Äôs not a life I‚Äôd want for anyone. In fact, as I have faced my own mortality I‚Äôm very aware that we aren‚Äôt here to exist in perpetuity. We better be here to cause no additional suffering in others, that‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôm fairly certain the OP offended you. But you actually showed OP another example, albeit less overt, of your snide bullying and accusations made as commentary and dripping with animus for groups of other human beings. Slice people up all you want there‚Äôs a part of some of us in most of all the possible boxes such that all of us share some box with everyone. So what is OP‚Äôs purpose? Not to hurt you or offend you - any time to think on this before reading into it would reassure you OP can‚Äôt have meant to hurt you because he has no idea you exist. Did he offend you? It certainly seems so. But how can he offend anyone who he 1) doesn‚Äôt know or understand with sufficient particularity; and, 2) we don‚Äôt have any evidence OP meant to offend anyone; and 3) we don‚Äôt even know OP nor understand where they‚Äôre at in life and what motivated this question; and lastly, 4) perhaps OP would clarify your assumptions about OP‚Äôs nationality, about cricket, about the values and outcomes of wider harmony or other interests that actually likely align you two more than make each other‚Äôs stance inapposite to the dignity of the other. Frankly, you offended yourself and projected your personal feelings in a bounded state with your knowledge, a poorly structured concept of reality to implant on another simply because it‚Äôs in your mind. Two minds never really can understand the others‚Äô reasoning, and we largely (convincingly) make up our own reasons for our actions and beliefs. I think the best choice here is to approach curiosity with the same. Be honest about your feelings and invite this person - initially terrible in your assessment- to share what feelings they have and understand both your experiences are real and true to their owners. They are passing by through the mind. They are the mind, briefly, sometimes partially, but needn‚Äôt ever come to define the mind state as only capable of what is then and there possessing it, and the mind is also never a fair definition of the person‚Äôs character in the moment or over time. Especially not the second. People become what they ingest and attend to and the least we can do is not feed strangers our hateful mind‚Äôs hurt and angry leftovers. It‚Äôs a good rule that favors you, actually, and it may or may not reach to effect another, but at least you won‚Äôt contribute to their hazardous mind state and probably serve to improve them. But hey, you can do as you wish and find the consequences are to live where they‚Äôre grown, in form or shadow, but important to keep yourself aware so we all don‚Äôt continue to cause confusion and conflict in ourselves and others.

Why did Kanimoli go to thoothukudi to contest and not in other cities? Its her caste as Nadar that has a major vote base in thoothukudi. Just a few examples.

        "India is a country which is losing its morals and values dya by day thanks to the fanatic religions and idiologies. The politicians and priests are busy in pouring money on nonsense projects. \nThe caste system should have gone away after Independence but if it goes away ,how will the ego of the upper caste survive?\n\nThings were moving towards an intellectual and understanding based society till the year 2014 but after that there is a blast from fanatics again as the current ruling party with it brings the colors of religion. \n\nYoung India is already in the trap of upper and lower castes. In schools and colleges offices and various other institutions,the caste system is still there and that too on a large scale.  Even if you go to major metro cities like Mumbai or Delhi people are foolishly under the impression of higher and lower caste and prefer to stay in their own casts and religions.\n\nAll these things are because of fanatic terrorist religious organisations.\n\nWhat ever glamour you see it is only a show off. Real India still sleeps hungry somewhere,or is raped and thrown in forests or is waiting for justice due to some or the other issue. \n\nHow Indians are made fools and exploited?\nReligion and priests exploit their spiritual needs,politicians exploit their social and security needs,Bollywood exploits their sexual needs, cricket exploits their need of ambition and success and whatever remains is exploited in the name of fear and inferiority complex(as taught by caste system from 10k years)\n\n9/10 Indian relationships are pseudo,social status matters and above all the ego boosts matters.\nPeople in the West are at least honest about their own mentality. The Indian mind is cunning and pretends to be very clever. On one hand they need science and on the other they have all kinds of superstition carved on their bones. \n\nIn the name of spirituality India is moving slowly towards doom. There is no spirituality remaining. People will go to temples like beggars and ask for materialistic things.\n\nWith time you may even see the entire caste system back in its dark glory soon. Beacuse the rulling party is trying its best to do so.\nThere are many aspects to consider.\n\nNobody can save India's doom.",

        "> how t\n\nA local can generally understand a person's caste from his or her surname, that is true. I understand your question is how is that surname related to caste?  \n\n\nThe answer to that is, that surname has historically been associated with people following a certain trade. For example, my surname is \"Karmakar\". The locals would immediately recognize that I am from the jeweller caste (\"Sonar\" in Bengali) because \"Karmakars\" have traditionally been in the jewellery making business from father to sons. Even today you can see that. If you were to visit West Bengal state of India, even today you will see many jewellery shops with the name \"<some first name> Karmakar & sons\".  \n\n\nBut \"Karmakar\" is not always fixed as a jeweller caste all over India. Caste definitions varies from region to region because ethnicity and language changes. Hell, I myself don't know which surname is a jeweller in another region of India. But from what I gathered that in other parts of northern India, jewellers are not marked under a specific caste but falls under a broad umbrella of trader/mercantile castes (\"Baniya\" in Hindi). I known one specific surname as an example of this who are \"Baniya\" but whose family business has been jewellery - Agrawal  \n\n\nHope this answers some of your questions."

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Dear Redditors, I recently stumbled upon a distressing video depicting an individual from a higher caste treating someone from a lower caste in a manner that was deeply unsettling (NSFW Link Below). This has lead me to question the continued existence of such behavior in today's society. I understand that the caste system, with its deep historical roots, has been a part of many cultures not only India but also other parts of the world, but I'm somewhat taken aback to see such explicit discrimination still apparent in the modern world and in a such country that will become a global powerhouse in few decades. Like how someone can do such thing? Is this kind of caste-based discrimination still a prevalent issue in certain regions? If yes, what Indian government is doing to destroy this culture rooted discrimination? Could anyone shed light on why these attitudes persist despite global advancements in human rights and societal understanding? [https://twitter.com/ConflictTR/status/1676896628823715840](https://twitter.com/ConflictTR/status/1676896628823715840) \\- NSFW",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Yes this video is from india and he is a currently ruling party member of india AKA Bhartiya Janta Party Mr Modi party Yes it's true he is from bjp party aka Modi's party ... Urinating on a ST MAN ... YET NOTHING FROM POLICE he was arrested, house bulldozed , Nsa invoked ..... what more do you want?? It is a common occurrence in India. Much worse shit has happened here for the last 3000 years. Most Indians are pathetic losers who get their high by demeaning others. That's what all the unity in diversity is all about. Trading insults, humiliating the next in line, etc, etc is how we keep our country in order. So there's either the Chinese model of homogeneity or the Indian model of venting out for a country with as huge a population as ours. >Yes it's true he is from bjp party aka Modi's party ... Urinating on a ST MAN ... YET NOTHING FROM POLICE Police arrested the guy and demolished his home. What more do you want? It‚Äôs quite common here ! Yes, caste-based discrimination exists. As far as the government's actions are concerned, you can read about it here: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66106342](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66106342). It is illegal. Police has arrested this man and has demolished his home (they do that sometimes). The President of india is a ST Woman (scheduled tribes), the Prime Minister is OBC (other backward castes). There are a lot of state mandated affirmative action policies to benefit lower caste people here. Unfortunately some people simply refuse to give up their centuries old mentality, there are laws to prevent it. But people use influence and power to position themselves above the law, especially in rural areas. Perfect answer It is rampant all over the country. You often hear people say it doesn't exist in cities and only happens in villages but thats simply not true. The fanciest buildings have separate elevators for residents and staff. People won't stand in a lift with someone \"lower\" but have no qualms eating food prepared by that very person. The hypocrisy is astounding. I want such instances to never occur in this country Long way to go for that. Yet people have the audacity to ask what's the necessity for reservation. Fucking psychopaths People have pissed on you or people have pissed you Caste discrimination occurs everywhere in the country,be it smaller rural areas or big cities. The difference is when it comes to big cities, the discrimination faced gets more subtle (serving maid/other blue collar workers in a different glass, making them sit on the floor rather than the sofa, separate lifts/toilets, it's classist and castiest) now all of us will get downvoted for saying the truth.. cause foreigner ko ham sach bata rahe equality and secularism ka natak karne k jagahü§£ I'm sorry but this justifies the existence of reservation? Dude can't live a day without taking Ji's name. It is true. Yes. Caste-based reservation should exist as long as caste-based discrimination exists. As simple as that ONLY because one commoner had the foresight to record the atrocity. And a 2nd commoner realized that the only way any action would be taken is if it went viral on social media. Even after it went viral, the first instinct of police was to protect that guy by making the victim sign an agreement that the 2 commoners were defaming the perpetrator and police should take action on them! What more do you want? 1) A professional police. One that doesn't first side with the perpetrator against the victim in absence of social media pressure. Then swings to the other extreme by bulldozing the perpetrator's home without a trial or respect for basic rights. All that hurry should be shown only in the lazy unprofessional police-lawyer-court system. and 2) More sensible citizens who don't need to be spoon-fed answers to \"what more do you want\" (assuming you weren't just being sarcastic) Love the way you downplayed everything. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be racist because a Black is my friend‚Äù energy. And Caste based discrimination will exist as long as Caste based reservation exists. I actually do not have any St or SC friends In urban areas, caste based reservation exists because of reservation. The feeling of unfairness that the majority of the competitive exam students have to face is a major issue that causes the rise of hate for the lower castes in them. Heck one of the reason newer urban generation dislikes lower castes is reservation But did the guy pee on the other person because he is from some other caste? Or did he pee on the other guy just because he wanted to? I mean either way it‚Äôs disgusting Fuck yeah, get out of your privileged glass house and horse and see the world Caste based discrimination has existed long before caste based reservation . What you‚Äôre saying sounds like - blindness will exist as long as braille system exists. What did he downplay exactly? He said everything as it is showing that the country has progressed but there are still people with a backward mindset. But the action is being taken against them. Not everything is an agenda lol. That's not what they meant. They were referring to your mentions of the Indian Prime Minister and President being SC/ST/OBC. What you don't realise is that they're both the exception, not the rule. Discrimination existed long before reservation existed. Reservation is necessary to bring the average financial prowess and social prestige of lower castes up to the level of upper castes. Only then will discrimination stop, because in India money and social prestige are the only antidotes for the arrogance of upper castes. This is the dumbest take. We have a problem x and hence y should exists even though y doesn't help in solving x in any matter (and in some cases may perpetuate it). Also y is very easy to exploit but let's forget about that as well. yes caste based discriminations exists in India. The way to end discrimination is not to have more discrimination. It is to end discrimination. Edit: It's sad that people here are rooting for more discrimination. It's a clear reflection of how deeply discrimination is ingrained in our society. And yet ironically, braille system does not cures blindness. But what's wrong with that. If someone doesn't know much about the country, how do you tell them that \"there are progress in the right direction and people a lot of people no longer believe in caste systems but at the same time it's not solved or eradicate\". I feel like he conveyed this pretty well through his statement. I don't think the president and prime minister fact is meant to side step the issue which what you maybe thinking Good answer. One nitpick - In India there is quota (reservations)for scheduled tribes, scheduled cast and other backward cast in college admissions, government jobs and in job promotions. College admissions quota is almost 50% of all seats. Quota is different from affirmative actions, as done in the US. Obviously not. Braille, just like caste based reservation, is an aid not a cure. Caste based reservation is a political tool to get votes. Politicians will try to keep this vote bank and thus it is in their favor to keep them poor and backward. We have politicized caste. People can't be equal, unless you treat them equal. Reservation should always have been economically based. Let's say a white man represents America and says racism is a thing of the past. It was deeply rooted in our history, but in this modern age, it is a thing of the very distant past. With modernism, it has deteriorated. See, he would be a white man representing the whole. Just like that, a narrative is in place that caste is a thing of the past. This narrative is preached by those who deny caste to avoid taking responsibility and to save face in the eyes of the world. It is a facade, and I think it has worked well. It denies casteism is there. Many are unaware due to this Just like slavery was a thing of the past when it was outlawed, its roots have survived as racism today. People are still marginalized and brutalized. Similarly, untouchability was a thing of the past because it was outlawed, but it still lives on as casteism. However, in India, it is not just cultural but also a religious thing. People can't identify with relegion without their caste from my experience, but it is not exclusive to certain religion(Hinduism that has origins). Now People of every religion practice casteism ( like islam and Christianity). Even though untouchability is banned, marriages are still largely caste-based, people want to know your caste before renting an apartment, and people tend to mingle more easily only if they are of the same caste. The first thing people want to know about others is their caste. Yes, there are people who do not care about caste, but they are a minority. Casteism is as prevalent as racism and communalism. In fact, casteism shares characteristics of racism as well as communalism. All three are identity-based. I think they are the same with some distinct differences. The very root is the same. Even black peyple faced untouchability ( apartheid) Sadly, caste has reached abroad. It is now a modern issue. Yes, caste is a problem not only in India but also in the entire Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc.) itself. Caste is a subcontinent problem. Governement of elected by people who advocate for communalism. Yup communal politics works here. Caste consciousness is there. Its people identity. That's the reason for casteism. People identify with caste and they cant think without it. If you're on the internet, you just need to search for caste-based discrimination and atrocities to find information about them. And the thing discrimination is one thing horrendus atrocity is another both are prevelant though outlawed. And they are on the rise with the rise of hindutva ideology in india. As per many sources, video is one year old. Might have been played for political gains. The person is arrested and govt is doing what all it can under law to punish d culprit. Larger question is is it common? IMO, it's there but it's decreasing... Why it's there? It's actually everywhere. In India it might b caste based, here u also have religion based. In west it's race based , religion based. U also see incidents of well to do ppl, educated ppl doing same.when drunk in flights... So, it's about behaviour. Many wise ppl say , that as a human - if v become true human is also more than enough. I belive the reservation shall exist for the poor, not the ones going to Coachings and private tutions, but rather for the ones who do not have those privilege. Honestly, my batch was fulled with SC/ST students, and the were proudly and openly lax that they would find a good college due to it, and they did too, I was also in OBC category, so yeah that applies on me as well. But long story short, I believe reservations shall be for the underprivileged rather than the SC/STs. You cite the laws that have been drafted against this. And then you paint the picture of the other, darker side with the stories of these lawmakers and their aides themselves not practicing what they draft. It's not rocketscience. Even Americans admit their founders were slave owners who preached that all men were created equal. Hanging for Modi, he planned this piss poor exercise of human rights violation (pun definitely intended) /s The fuck is you talkinabout‚Äô The ST president was not allowed inside a temple and wasn‚Äôt invited to the new parliament on its opening ceremony (because she would ‚Äúpollute it‚Äù). Kids are being beaten up for drinking water from a tap they aren‚Äôt allowed to touch, asked to clean the bathroom of their public school because they belong to a community, raped in a crematorium, entire family killed because a minor girl from the lower caste wouldn‚Äôt let go of being raped by Prime Minister‚Äôs own party‚Äôs member of legislative assembly just where the fuck do you live in? (The last two incidents happened 2 hours from where you live in you dumbass). Yes it's true in fact I just got another news, In Fathepur, two muslim youths rape a dalit girl and then force her to drink her urine. They also believe they are above then any other religion and their sub-caste. Their illegal properties will be getting bulldozed too. Also, The CM of the state remarked, a criminal has no caste or religion. Alas, you can never separate these from the victim and culprit. It is for this reason a shukla demeans a lower caste someone. And why separate, the crime of a Muslim man is not just a crime by a 'man'. The headlines clearly state, 'Muslim man' Read the bottom para of my original comment again Speak for yourself, Stormy Daniels He thinks he can do it if he wants to, because the guy is from a lower caste considered tribal community:) Indian society has been run on the basis of caste system for probably thousands of years. The British came and generally gave jobs on basis of caste. This further depended the divide. When india finally got its independence, it was pretty much unanimously agreed among our freedom fighters that the evils of this caste system must be dealt away with. A lower caste person in Dr. Bhima Rao ambedkar drafted our constitution and discrimination on basis of caste was made a criminal offence. I think in 1992 on basis of report of mandal committee reservation in colleges for lower caste was given. But this has added to resentment now a general category student like me has to score very high marks as compared to a person with reservation. This reservation is like 50 percent of total seats. 40 percent of seats in lok sabha have also been reserved for sc/st and many political leaders like Lalu Prasad yadav raised issues and supported the lower caste people. The current president of India is also from sc/st community. Casteism is still rampant in states like Bihar which is also the most poor state in India. It takes time to change people:s ideologies and in india an unfortunate thing has happened unlike in western countries where internet has helped to reduce discrimination and where if you were caught using a casteist slur on tape it can probably ruin your life in india it is being used as a tool to further spread hate against Muslims especially and to a lesser extent against lower caste The guy asked for his money, and then another guy assaulted him and urinated on him. Bigots will always find excuses to be bigots. If we went by actual population demographics without historical caste-based oppression, the general public would have access to only 20-30 percent of jobs & seats. It's kinda hilarious to see privileged castes whine and moan despite beint vastly over-represented everywhere. Truly! I've seen people who scored 25/150 in LLB Hons getting admitted in ILS (one of the prestigious law schools in Pune) its so difficult for the general category to get in but reservation people got in easily that too in the first round itself. I wouldn't have mind it if their scores would've been 80-90 out of 150 but seriously 25? I got 107 and still wasn't admitted. And the amount of students I've seen in my batch who got in majorly based on caste system,live in lavish bungalows, own iphones, personal car and still they must avail their rights under caste and reduce the fees by far. Why the hell are you the one getting downvoted? All SC‚Äôs, ST‚Äôs are not manual scavengers. But all manual scavengers are SC‚Äôs ST‚Äôs. Tells you a lot about the country as well. Right. Was waiting for this comment Asking r/India to explain a complex sociological issue is like asking blind person for directions or a French mime to testify in court in character. This is true. Some people apparently got mad at you but instead of arguing all they could do was downvote. Lol reservations exist to uplift and empower the marginalized. Even if you have problem with it, the country would still have reservations Unfair?....do u people even realise upper category seats are taken by only other upper category better marks students and not lower category students....how is it unfair if u can't get good marks in your own category?.....u get less marks and start hating lower caste people for securing ranks in their respective category. And u call it an issue? Lmao I'm sorry I had to. A lot of people had to take a gap year without their will because they didn't get in ANY college while reservation people were in all good colleges without getting even half the marks. I request one and all to read Annihilation of Caste by Dr. Ambedkar. I hope that it will be included in highschool syllabus in the future. Edit: I understand that that foul book, Manusmriti has a far greater likelihood of getting in the syllabus than Dr. Ambedkar's Annihilation of Caste. But I refuse to accept that it is a foregone choice. Annihilation of Caste needs more and more inclusion in our popular discourse and engagement. More of us need to read the book. Our engagement in reddit today, now, is one small step towards that goal. Both of the men were high they were drunk and when people were drunk shit happened, It's just that the people and political parties want to make the issue about caste to gain voters by helping the victim. I beg to differ here. Maybe not all over the country. I am from Kerala and haven't observed even a single instance of caste based discrimination. It used to exist during my grandma's era but not to this extent that the lower caste folks were treated like cattle. I love how people who haven't passed a single competitive exam in their life and thus haven't seen the mental pressure on students that leads to depression and multiple cases of suicides every year jump to defend some politically exploited victim privileges that don't even help the people who need them. Except he did that as well? Did you not just say the same thing down the thread and I agreed with you. In my opinion, the current government wins votes on religious politics so this type of behaviour is just a byproduct of that. Well, to be fair, the man was an MP of bjp Unfortunately, it's true There are people who still have this mentality, however we have come a long way still. well if thats the case they should be solely based on a persons income instead of his caste. remove all reservations except ews. Lol This nation sucks because of reservation. I who scored 2.9k in advanced will be joining some 3rd gen iits where some guy who scored 15k rank will be joining 1st gen iit. Undeserving candidates get better opportunities. Hence deserving candidates leave the country and excel in their fields in other nations In an ideal world, yes, EWS quota should only apply but in a country as corrupt as India anyone can get an EWS certificate. Even in the US, they rely on race based reservation (affirmative action) since income based reservation is almost impossible to implement This is continuation of what happened. That is the point, nobody who is underprivileged, dosen't matters if they fall under SC/ST can truly enjoy the reservations, I think barely half of that population is aware of JEE , CAT etc. Does it exist? Yes. Is it appalling? Absolutely yes. But it's not special to India. Discrimination, be it on the basis of race, or caste, or religion, or sex etc exists all over the world. Edit: since some people asked, I have traveled across and lived in various parts of Europe and Americas for 15 years now. I speak from first hand experience. Edit2: earlier today on reddit post I read that a (not Indian) 15 year old girl got sexually harassed in a terrible way. So what would people say now? That casteism is worse than sexism? Or better? Is the non-Indian girl's pain any less than this man's? My heart goes out to both, equally, and if acknowledging universal love hurts the idiots, so be it. Dont use specific impoverished Northern states to represent all of India. well youre exaggerating it terribly its sort of ludicrious to suggest there are diff elevators for diff castes where tf do you even live ? also its sort of impossible in this day and age to tell a persons caste from his face. The not so surprising arc of the story hasn't been told yet. A Brahmin organization awarded Rs. 51,000 as a prize money to the high caste Hindu who urinated on the lower caste person. This is Hinduism and India in a nutshell. You have to understand there is nothing like a Hindu religion at all. It is a Brahmin political party in reality. Just like CCCP. Kshtariyas are military wing, Banias are economic managers; and dalits are slaves and manual labour. Ambedkar, one of the rare enlightened Indians, dissed Brahmins when he said show me a Brahmin Voltaire. Hindus are the only religion in the world that could not come up with any concept of justice. India is a wasted potential due to Hindu fascism being perpetuated by Brahmins. I agree, but include PWD with it. Yup this is quit common here in India. Indians piss everywhere. It‚Äôs part of our culture and tradition. ü§òüèª Lol this nation has so much more to worry about than bitter students complaining about their rank. Please think beyond yourself and consider the systemic problem reservation is trying to fix. It is absolutely true. - President of India, a dalit (scheduled caste) woman wasnt allowed inside a temple and the cover up -> - Same president not invited for the new parliament (because brahmin priests are conducting poojas and she will be \"sullying\" it) - Lower caste Student (child) beaten up by principal for drinking water - Lower caste kid killed by teacher for drinking water from a pot - Lower caste man killed for drawing water - Lower caste man beaten up for entering temple - Different city same incident - different differnet city you get the idea - Lower caste sisters were raped and the bodies burnt (to prevent autopsy) and the reporter was jailed for two years for reporting it - Prime minister's party's MLA (elected member of lower parliament) raped a dalit minor girl and killed her family was and is being killed - Millions of Tribals are being forced out of their ancestral land in favor of mining companies This is just what that keeps me up at night. There are several incidents I have forgotten.. The things that muslim and christian minorities go through that I have omitted here.. The things that is happening to whiste blowers, right to information activists, reporters who arent bought out.. The things that werent in my attention.. I can't go through them at all. I am deeply ashamed at some of the apologists here.. Do check my previous comment on this thread.. The top upvoted comment? The guy lives in an area that is responsible for half of these incidents. Its like a white guy from Georgia telling you racism doesn't exist.. ugh! The caste system has been abolished by the government. But that doesn't mean that it has been eradicated once and for all. Unfortunately this still exists but in rural villages and districts. It is not widely seen tbh. There are still small sects that practise it or choose to practise it as and when they want to. For example, there's a marriage proposal for a girl from the boys side. The parents might be okay with the marriage and given the go ahead. But there still might be people in the village who might not want a lower caste boy marrying an upper class girl in the village. People might raise an objection and create a ruckus. In their minds, this marriage will set a precidence/an example for future. These people try to hold on to the caste system and use it as and when it suits them. They do it to remain in power and show their superiority and dominance in the community. They might be literally useless otherwise but it's a way to maintain dominance. The government has programmes for the lower caste people like SC (scheduled caste) and ST (Scheduled Tribes) in terms of education and employment. There are quotas for such people in the system. I need you to understand that this is not accepted by the majority of the population. My dad comes from a rural village in South India and there is no caste system prevalent there atm. None at all. It was prevalent in the early 80's and I remember it as a child. Pls understand that this is headline news - because it's abt demeaning someone because of his (lower) caste by someone who is the son of a politician. A small time politician I believe but still one. His son assumes that he is some big sh1t and can do as he likes. The accused has been arrested from what I read last and charges have been filed. Again, the majority of the majority does not support this prejudice. Sadly it's still prevalent in the rural villages. The law isn't apt enough to catch every crime while/before it happens. We have our issues which is ours and our own. It is what it is but it will fade away soon - things take time sometimes. Justice shall always prevail. Well.. the way things are going we are more likely to have *Manusmriti* included in the syllabus. Comrade, the goal of reservation is not poverty alleviation but ensuring representation of socially backward group of people in the mainstream of society As someone who is living in himachal i gotta say one thing. Dude here some ST groups are earning more than OBC and general. Like we have ST neighbours who i respect a lot but it's unfair that they are getting much better advantage in terms of tax, education etc than us even if they are earning 2x more than us. This is true, and people like this are the main reason modern society is turning into a shit hole. Are you a first gen graduate tho? He maybe because his ancestors was oppressed and prevented from getting any education. Reservation exists to ensure representation and not related to anything else like money. So you're saying Reservation helps in solving Casteism? If so, then it's not working. Yes, it is true. Seems like the guy was drunk af. He has been dealt with, and has been booked under the harshest law available in Indian Penal code.

Non sharing of Roti-Beti( food-daughter)concept still prevails if not untouchability. By your logic, reservations hasn't been helpful. Reservation IS an affirmative action. And what's stopping politicians to use economically based reservation system as political tool? I feel that the problem is that our reservation system is not updated to current needs and looks only at caste. I know people from my college who were third generation benefittors of the system. If the grandfather received higher college education with the help of reservation and the father got premier college admissions due to scst reservations, does the son still deserve further reservations? I think what we need is reservation, but not just based on caste alone. A similar system to what is there in OBC section maybe? Where the financial status also comes into play(creamy layer and otherwise). This way the problem of undeserving people of the lower caste getting preference can be solved to an extent. (I am a member of an OBC who just finished post graduation without receiving any reservation all my life, and I see why. From a demographic stand I don't see why I should get any reservation, just because my forefathers belonged to a lower caste.). It's 100% true. Most of the folks on reddit are from upper caste and wealthy backgrounds who are insulated from discrimination. Its like if you're a white person living in bay area and haven't seen racial discrimination, it does not mean America is free of racism. his house has been demolished btw An amputee will use a walking stick even though it won't help him grow his leg back. But does that mean you should throw it away? He will need it to walk somewhat like others It's political bro caste based discrimination is still a thing, but it isn't half as extreme as the case in the video. unless you're a man of power, you probably wouldn't even think of urinating on someone let alone post it, because of course there will be repercussions. but ig the law doesn't apply equally to some people of the rulling party That's hilarious bro... I don't see the toppers of IIT working in india after graduating from IIT... You are all just using reservation as an excuse to justify your shitty mentality. Though it's not perfect, reservation is the only way to right the unfair treatment meted out to our fellow citizens for over many millennia. Yeah it does..even with the younger urban generation.. Matched with a woman (28) on Bumble.. Read the bio later.. Said swipe right if (pandit).. You got this from your MA Sociology Final Semester Thesis, comrade? Caste discrimination exists Economics is a strict measureable component, unlike caste. Someone's poor, they get all the support needed, they become financially stable and able to sustain themselves. Reservations stop. You should have studied harder son, instead of whining. So a blind person's son who is not blind, will still use braille? If not, why does the son of a successful Person, who used the caste system to raise themselves out of poverty, still get to use the caste system when they don't need it? Most of these \"people\" that use influence and power to position themselves above law are politicians. Even the person in this question was a BJP MLA representative. So more often than not, BJP uses these types of people and their influence to remain in power, instead of taking action against them. It won't matter if the president is an ST woman or PM is OBC, as long as they ALLOW these thugs to be above law. He's the vice president of the local unit of BJ Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of BJP and a close aide of the local BJP MLA Twist to the story: The lower caste person is a Morarji Desai fan and asked for it. \\- Written by M Night Shyamalan > If yes, what Indian government is doing to destroy this culture rooted discrimination? Destroy? They are actively promoting it. That is why such acts, which were done in the shadows earlier, are being done out in the open. >new parliament on its opening ceremony (because she would ‚Äúpollute it‚Äù). Stop spreading hate. She wasn't invited so that Modi could inaugurate the building. Not because she was ST. Are you saying that not even one member of SC/ST's were not part of the inauguration? No where has it been reported that she would pollute the building. It is sick how you just twisted the truth. As if we don't have any problems you are creating a new one. Oh yea? I am a general student who studied in a NIT during AIEEE time and one of the old IIMs through CAT. I think reservations are necessary based on interactions I‚Äôve had with loads of people across my 30 odd years of existence. Don‚Äôt assume everyone is as ignorant as you. If that's the case, it might be uplifting. In some cases uplifting the already uplifted people and not working for disadvantaged Dalits. And secondly, education should be changed. I don't see teachers or parents telling about this to their kids. Atleast teachers should be openly talking about this & should sensitise the kids that we are all equal & how evil discrimination is. Guess what? Educated people themselves resort to discrimination. üòè >It is true. Speaking as kinda an \"Alien üëΩ\" this planet is a freaking nightmare sometimes... You must be in the wrong part of the Kerala then, comrade. Heard about Madhu? How many tribal groups are in the mainstream? Even in the highly developed Ernakulam, I could see subtle instances of racism. Why not, the person who peed was proven to be associated with BJP Sure, so super rich kids of \"lower cste\" people can simple hog on these reserved seats? What a fucking illogical solution to a deeply rooted problem. It has certainly helped a lot in their representation. But now this is just getting out hand, and just seems unfair to the rest of the people working their assess off. Seems more like a divide and conquer tactic to keep people fighting for the real problems that lie within. The time for reservation is up, and it wont be long till this bane of a problem gets solved. Thank you for this comment and the links. We have a long way to go It's an extremely rare case but true. The perpetrators house is demolished and CM kf Madhya pardesh washed victim's feet for sorry The accused was punished by the government authorities, his house which apparently illegal encroachment, has been taken down by bulldozer and the man has been penalized. The Chief Minister of that particular province, called the tribal man in CM house and washed his feet as a sign of respect. Yes, it is true. Discrimination based on caste is still prevalent today despite all the advances India has made in other sectors. And lets not forget the way some people treat anyone they consider below them ie security guards and maids. That is a whole other box of doodoo. What is the government doing about it? Nothing lol ¬Ø\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\_/¬Ø There‚Äôs people who practice casteism in the US. It may not be up to this level of violence but caste based discrimination is everywhere. Wealth, power, and land in India is still held by upper castes. Stop downplaying casteism I have seen middle class(lower caste) people getting treated differently. Me n my friend both are from diff caste(him upper /me lower) even though we share our food drinks everything but when it comes to his family they don't even eat or drink anything given by mine. Even though we are neighbours. The water in our taps comes from the same place. The food we buy is from the same local market. So yes I can say that Caste based Discrimination is still present in India. Yeah, this level isn‚Äôt normalized like this anywhere else. Stop downplaying casteism. Thank you! We can only get there by acknowledging the actual problems. This trend is everywhere -> You‚Äôve going to get so downvoted by the apologists here. The irony is that the people who will downvote you are the ones who suffer from this system. The IT cell isn‚Äôt Brahmins. It‚Äôs the poor taken advantage of the Brahmins The only book that needs to be included in the syllabus is the constitution Oh really? If she is present then Modi CAN NOT inaugurate the building? This is the country that dissolved cow dung in water tanks to purify the water after Dalits have drawn water from them. Please just shut the fuck up man. Take the L and talk about how to be equitable, just and be better people. You know it's pretty common in rural areas and rare but still in urbam areas. But i think as the next generations are nobody really care about what case are you of. For example,i have grown in a well developed areas bit my roots are still of \"lower caste\" but my friend circle still treats me like a friend would. Even our parents are okay with it but when it comes to there grandparents, well some are okay and some are not. No I have studied enough I am a top ranker. I got 2.9 k rank in 11 lakh students. To get a seat in iitb cse i should have gotten a rank below 50 but an st girl with 4k rank would land in iitb cse Fuck u all So when you find the problem of caste discrimination, the best thing you can come up with is to introduce an equal but opposite form of discrimination in society? I am not ignorant, I just don't create stupid solutions which do more harm than good. Is it just me or that adding things to syllabus really doesn't do much? I mean, as kids we already had a LOT to digest. Huge courses, huge syllabus, homeworks, what not. Does it really make much impact if we dump things in syllabus? For the taker, it's always going to be a 5-point answer that they'll forget about later in life. The only thing I remember from school is \"Mitochondria is the powerhouse of cell\". Haha I gave a similar response and was downvoted too. It's horrifying how extremist people have become, how unable they are in seeing the big picture and a neutral mindset. Anyway, good answer. > Is this kind of caste-based discrimination still a prevalent issue in certain regions? Yes >If yes, what Indian government is doing to destroy this culture rooted discrimination? Could anyone shed light on why these attitudes persist despite global advancements in human rights and societal understanding? On paper there are strict rules against discrimination of any form. But the powers that be would rather that citizens stay divided. Hell, Narendra Modi would've never been elected and terror organizations backing him would be declared as such if there was more unity in the country. Yes, it's true. Sadly even though the constitution has laws which protect these people, they suffer heavy discrimination to this day. People from the lower castes are still m\\*rdered for entering temples or doing stuff which according to the so-called higher caste hindus, is not allowed as they don't belong to their caste. It's a deep rooted evil within our society which reduces a person's identity to their caste. Yes it's true. All Hindus believe in caste based supremacy that becomes apparent in my many social settings but especially in marriage or buying properties It's a disgusting mindset of birth right supremacy of certain higher caste and inferiority of lower caste. The lower caste Hindus wp, no matter how qualified will never be welcomed as a member of higher caste. Its common in all Hindus Although the above example is extreme, but caste based hatred and atrocities are way common even among most educated of Hindus Its not explicit in urban areas but its there quite a lot behind closed doors. >If she is present then Modi CAN NOT inaugurate the building? It would bring into question why the ritual head of state wasn't inaugurating the building. I don't support such a move. It could be any number of reasons. But polluting a building??? That's your reason. Bitch you just misrepresented facts. This is your line of thinking. You think she wasn't invited because she would pollute the building. >This is the country that dissolved cow dung in water tanks to purify the water after Dalits have drawn water from them When did anyone deny this? Yeah it happens. But we are on a path of change. But over time there is a decrease in such attitudes. It takes time to dismantle deeply embedded social structures. Heck, the US deals with racism even today more than 150 years since the end of slavery. >Take the L and talk about how to be equitable, just and be better people. Mahapurush, say what you want. Just don't twist facts. You were caught lying. You obviously have your own agenda you are trying to push. Pretty much every where behind closed doors. This is just PR. It means nothing. good, at least people will know the fucked up parts of hinduism and stop going on and on about how best religion vro it‚Äôs not even a religion vro it‚Äôs a way of life vroü§ì it is true, the govt is doing nothing, the society is in the complete support of the govt doing nothing and is itself supporting the upper caste assaulters, not just this one, its a common sight now to see rapists of upper castes being welcomes by upper caste women by doing their aarti, putting flower garlands on them as well as tying rakhi to them (a gesture which the sister ties a thread on her brother's wrist, signifying these women consider these rapists there brother bec they raped the women of minorities and lower castes) India is a shit place right now, I want to get out of here. Apply UCC already in this damn country (Apologies for the long read) Hi, yes it continues and is very prevalent in almost entire India. One might argue that urbanism deprecates casteism and it holds true in Indian context. However the reality is that urbanism camouflages casteism through indirect action rather than direct. There are various researches you can easily google. Having academically researched on the issue of caste and the benefit of reservation (affirmative action of sorts), I can tell you one of the most prominent reasons for continuation of caste system. It is a malpractice of our culture. The original and authentic culture of hinduism provided for fluid social identities based on occupation. That is to say, A garbage collector would be at a lower strata of social identity (called a shudra). But if his son/daughter studies and becomes a teacher, he would not be identified as a Shudra but rather a Brahmin (top most social identity). This was the original varna system in the early vedic times. However, through corruption of minds in the later vedic age and colonial brits manipulating varna system into a caste system; it became a birth based system where you must carry the social identity of your ancestors (primarily paternal). This is why reservation system was introduced by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Please keep in mind that reservation is not a poverty alleviation scheme where it does not mean that if a person entitled to benefit becomes financially sound then they should not get the benefits. This is because even at a joint secretary level in India, people from these communication do face caste discrimination on a routinely basis. People are still murdered for marrying a higher caste person or even venturing nearby a temple. Another very crucial reason for continuation of casteism is lack of intellect. I am not talking about lack of education, but about intellect. A majority of Indian population is quick to be influenced. Technology and provocative notions being propagated fuels in to this enmity. Same is indirectly promoted by governments too (both current and previous ones) The only solution is that someone comes to power who makes it their life goal to educate people on this issues and punish where necessary. Then maybe in 2 or 3 generations, we might not have casteism and in turn, no need for reservation system. However, reservation system is not the cause but the remedy. Caste based mentality has to go first before reservation system goes. Fuck. That sounds like something Jaggu would say. üíÄ no? reservation was never created to ‚Äúsolve casteism‚Äù. it was created to have equal representation. which it is successful in doing. that‚Äôs it. Reservation was a patchwork temporary solution at best. If it were working there would not be a need to justify its existence time and again. Representation for the socially discriminated is important but if you aren't going to educate everyone and remove the ideas of caste from people's minds, it's an incomplete solution. Reservation was a first step towards that but now it is nothing more than a tool for division that needs to be overhauled or incidents like these will keep on happening again and again and again. Why? Because reservation does not spread awareness. Reservation has to be like the first step of a 12 step program to fix these problems in our society. But because of some very divisive figures in our political history, it has just become a tool for gathering votes from communities. It'll be cherry picked reading only. They'll ignore it try to justify the unpleasant parts like every other religion Bruh our ST President holds no power absolutely. Idk how you got that under the umbrella of affirmative action. The qualifications and identity of the PM is anyone a big question mark. So lets not even get into that. But research well before opining utter crap. LOL, they just proved my point. My negative votes on the comment is a testament to how we as a people put people down. We make sure that we are able to impose our view or our take on a matter using any of the saam, daam, danda, bhed tactics. Thanks downvoters. Honestly that's just how most South Asians work.For example, If you go comment on r/indianmuslims the mod will just block you if you give an opposing view. The same is true of Pakistanis, Lankans and Burmese. All these folks literally thrive by ostracising communities, by using mental harassment techniques to make the other submit. In the western fringes, even to a certain extent violence and direct confrontation was historically used to assert dominance of a class over other. In South Asia, it is a lot of mind games, so they end up doing things like pee on a man, convert a woman, or do some other shit. Because they are children of losers who ran away from the West and migrated towards the East over millenia. And that loser gene hasn't faded away. They are still carrying it to this day. (Sarcastic undertones, but kinda true) Now I am not saying every Indian is like that. But since it is a part of our 'culture' even the most well meaning of us intentionally or unintentionally does end up doing things that I mentioned. And that means that sometimes I do it too. For fucks sake I am close to Allahabad, Jabalpur and those kinds of region. I literally live next door to the place where this incident happened. But when I say I do this I mean that I might talk disrespectfully to someone or be careless with language etc and thus I am perpetuating this behaviour. But atleast I am aware of my faults and making changes. The downvoters or some other fucks instead have a perfect image of themselves and believe that they have the perfect information. How has it gone out of hand? Has it resulted in over-representation like that the uc enjoys? Infact it's the uc folks who have infiltrated the reservation system by corruption and taking the seats which is supposed to be for marginalized. A low caste, even if grown economically is not immune for being discriminated by caste. A very prime example of Mrs. President. If not solving the discrimination and casteism, what does equal representation seek to accomplish? Caste system is uniquely Indian. What other cultures are you talking about? It is a hierarchy based on birth that is part of religion. That makes it unique. We want this not to happen with anyone else irrespective off race caste sex etc!! Can you help?? Because Brahmins have cleverly pushed the hate project of nationalism upon the masses, and people across all sorts of divides have embraced it stupidly. So discrimination didn't exist before reservation? C'mon dude. Such low quality of logic. are any of your parents/grandparents educated? till any level, high school diploma or bachelor‚Äôs degree or master‚Äôs degree? Or casteism for that matter, considering that 1000s of Indians are over there. The casteism that we have today was not there before the British Occupation. We had caste and sub-caste, but it was not discriminatory. AFAIK. The discrimination that you see today is thanks to the British occupation. We as a country have been disconnected from our tradition and historical roots for almost 1000 years because of the Mughal rule and then the British and our education system is shit so you will see and experience these things. The silver lining the current generation is a little less discriminatory and open-minded compared to the previous generation. Gaand nhn chaatne ko mil payegi na Gori Mem ki is thread pe isliye kar rahe hain.

My parents did masters degree then why do all iit graduates also leave the country and go bootlick westerners?üíÄ only the people who didn‚Äôt get into iit should be leaving na, according to your logic He can not actually. Like by rule if the President is there she will be the one doing these things. It's like a rule or something. The first assumption itself is wrong that a white man represents America. America shd b represented by true Americans or red Indians. Second, since red Indians were oppressed by whites - it's the prerogative of the red Indians to speak on the subject rather than self certification by a white man. Sadly, it's true. The cast system is deeply rooted and will still continue to grow as parents still do teach their kids about this kind of things, and for this to be completely a forgone tradition in India it will surely take a few decades or at least until the people from more or less from my parents age group are no more. I am 18. The situation is way worse than anywhere else, they kill for their animal god. crazy that you think income is a strict measurable component and not caste, when people lie about their income all the time and get away with it and people are unable to shake off the shackles of casteism even after changing/getting rid of their surnames lmao Because money does not guarantee immunity to caste-based discrimination. Well you knew that you should've gotten a rank below 50 for getting a seat. You should have prepared for the exam keeping that in mind. Your failure to score that much, is not a fault of that st girl. I'll agree that the powers of President are nominal only in India and unless there is a state of emergency President is just a namesake head . But Modi Community is indeed OBC, idk about his education qualifications. But he's always been a Modi and they are classified as OBC But caste based reservation, which is at jobs and Colleges, which helps you find a job, which brings in money, which is the final goal anyway, will give immunity to caste based discrimination idk about the rest of india but literally any mid tier residence building in mumbai has separate lifts for maids, couriers, basically any blue collar worker which is mostly people of lower castes. one of my friend‚Äôs building, a high rise one, didn‚Äôt allow maids to take the resident‚Äôs lift even when the service lift was not working lmao Try lie about your income in a Government job, or almost any salaried position. Reminds me of some ayyan - ayyangear Tamil bramin food delivery service in US, from like 2 years ago. Caste based discrimination is sadly a truth across most of India. The video is shocking but as long as people (esp savarna people) have that belief in caste as a real thing that makes you greater/lesser I don't think it will end. The Dalit/Ambedkarite movement is pretty much our only saving grace against caste as a nation. I don't think that the time for reservation is up, comrade. And if you read newspapers daily, you will also think so Are you a r33tard? Did you even read what I wrote? Reservations are not about eradicating poverty, they are about equal representation. Equity and not equality is the word, you idiot. yes, if you‚Äôre the ruling party you‚Äôre going to be scrutinised a lot. you‚Äôre literally serving the people. Caste based reservation, at its root is just another form of discrimination. Its treating two people differently based on caste. You keep reservation, the discrimination will never go away coz people are treated differently, people are grouped into Categories. It is true and authorities have taken strict action against the culprit. Generally this problem is with the society's mindset, Governments in past and present have taken necessary steps and done all they can but at the end it is the people who need to be conscious about these things. But things are changing and we look forward to a future without discrimination. You're kinda slow if you think affirmative action is discrimination I see nowhere mention of caste other by you it can be anything in terms of context anyway let‚Äôs just say media is brainwashed Forced Equal representation at the expense of merit. You can fine with that, but at the end of the day it's just another form of discrimination, people treated differently because of caste. of course classism and racism exists all over the world. in no other part of the world is it deeply tied into religion and culture though. otherwise casteism in islam and christianity, whcih does exist in india, would exist in every single country on the planet. i mean it even exists in sikhism, a religion that was literally created to get rid of the caste system, jatts are still considered the highest There is something called \"[Reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_(transitional_justice))\", which is what Caste Based Reservations aim to do. And \"merit\" depends on the social conditions of an individual. [https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/a-belief-in-meritocracy-is-not-only-false-its-bad-for-you](https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/a-belief-in-meritocracy-is-not-only-false-its-bad-for-you) It is true for rural areas in most states. From my experience, this cycle of discrimination breaks to a large extent for families / persons raised in more cosmopolitan cities, although this is also not always true. The biggest contributor is the older generation keeps on indoctrinating the younger generation on this. Even my parents, whom I have never seen discriminate in any way on caste, at the time of my marriage proposals, used to become casteist. It is ingrained in our society and manifests in a multitude of ways. Tamilnadu having followed EV Ramasamy inspired Dravidian politics is still a highly casteist state. Ex. Actor Surya from Tamilnadu belongs to a community called Gounder from the Coimbatore region, just because he married Jothika who is not from the same community, he was never invited to any of their relative's functions, contrast this with his brother who visits his hometown regularly for such events / even local temple festivals. Another example from same community where a friend of mine hasn't gotten married at the age of 43 because he wants a girl from the same Gounder caste as their family fears that if they marry outside their caste then they would be ignored by their relatives / groups. This is same across majority of the state. This so called Dravidian Politics exists for namesake. Surprisingly I see many brahmins who have married other caste people but this doesn't seem to happen often with other castes. Very true. I have seen Hindu radicals lament about \"division in hindus\" while others are united, and I say, how will that unity come if we keep discriminating by caste ? who is jagguüò≠ It is true and most of us are equally appalled and disgusted with the act. Here and as well as in any country there are people who are literally scum of the highest order and sad excuse for a human being. The caste based discrimination is indeed still prevalent especially in smaller cities and villages. What especially is sad that the same cities and villages are quite connected to the world via Insta, FB etc. yet this bias is so deep routed, don't think it's going away anytime soon. Many gen iitians like me didn't get the desired branch and clg. Undeserving candidates got those seats. So we leave to the places where the deserving candidates get the chance. You're kind of an idiot if you don't realize that reservations in India in their current form are textbook discrimination. Nice try I would like to believe that being part of the high school syllabus helps. It enters into conversations in households that previously knew Dr. Ambedkar only from political posters and semi-forgotten history texts. Students get to read his analysis of caste instead of just memorising some date of adoption. The guy sitting is drunk? White people hold all positions of power. Why do rw hindu folks try to make themselves appear as victims? Seriously WHY? Yeh toh apno ko apna nahi maante. Meanwhile, they're out in full force to reconvert Muslims, Christians and others. Just so they have more people to discriminate against. I've seen quite a few recommend this. While a few may make the effort to read, it'd be nice if you could share a bit of the highlights of the book to whet some more people's appetite on the same. Caste discrimination is everywhere. How did you got to know about Manusmriti? You both are getting downvoted because of your whataboutery. Topic in discussion is casteism in india and all you can say is ‚Äúwhat about racism‚Äù. One social evil existing doesn‚Äôt mean another has to exist too. But I know this doesn‚Äôt matter to you, as self proclaimed neutrals in issues like casteism are just people who can‚Äôt say it out loud that they‚Äôre casteist. If you can‚Äôt shun it openly and you‚Äôd rather take a neutral viewpoint over a gross and unanimously accepted social evil, then everyone can see right through you and on Reddit it translates into downvotes. But hey, couple of downvotes are a small price to pay to being casteist :) >in no other part of the world is it deeply tied into religion and culture though. Try telling that to the current South Asian immigrants in France or Jews of the past in Germany or just about any brown person in Eastern Europe. I don't know. Why r u asking me about RW Hindu? It's true. Some drunk guy urinated on another drunk guy. Now the other person comes from some tribal caste so Media is giving it a hate crime angle which is bullshit. \"Red Indians\" - Just by using this outdated term you've discredited yourself. CM said this poor guy is like sudama but who is Krishna their This guy who is urinate or the CM. A woman also faced a similar incident somewhere in MP where she was forced to eat human Fecus. This is the new sanatani India which could never be modern. >You both are getting downvoted because of your whataboutery. You don't know the meaning of 'whataboutery'. Any discrimination is wrong. Period. Acknowledging multiple forms of discrimination isn't whataboutery. Trumping one form of discrimination over other, though, is actually along the themes of whataboutery. &#x200B; >If you can‚Äôt shun it openly and you‚Äôd rather take a neutral viewpoint 'Neutral' means being able to acknowledge that all discriminations are equally bad. I would not in good conscience say this gross act of casteism is any better or worse than the reddit post I read today where a 15 year old girl got sexually harassed. It's not about casteism, or sexism- it's about the bigger umbrella of discrimination. Read the asnwers carefully before giving halfassed comments. There is absolutely no need for reservation if india is ever to grow as a society it needs to aim towards equality rather than straight out shifting privileges that's still discrimination with swapped sidesüëæ Sadhguru. Off course. It's outdated as whites have tried their level best to finish them. Ikr If that was the case they could've gone for wealth based reservation rather than dividing on basis of caste Casteism is way way worse than what you call Racism. There is a book called Manusmriti. It's Hindu Code of Conduct. Read it and you will understand. The hatred for lower caste is imprinted in the Indian DNA. The upper caste people treat them as sub human. It's still prevalent. At some place it's subtle and other places Not. Yes, it is true. But based on this one person, one can't say Indian society is bad. There are always bad elements in every society. If we look at western countries, everyday someone comes with guns and shoots 10-15 of the innocents, islamic states are publicly executing the people, those events need more attention instead of a drunk man urinating on other in world. The culprit in this case has been detained and receiving proper treatment. The media covering every moment of that so no one dares to do so cheap activity. [https://twitter.com/ChouhanShivraj/status/1676826713454686209?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChouhanShivraj/status/1676826713454686209?s=20) This is surely a political drama but yes this also happens here. Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev. That Isha dude. Max the government will do if they come across your post is tell you to mind your own business rather than poking your nose in our interpersonal matter. Westerners are well aware of human rights whereas Indians care less about it because of the rooted caste based dominance over all these year. Now we have become used to it so much that we seldom talk about it on the 4th day after the incident occurred. That's why the Fanta government stops westerners to get into the picture. It's easier to manipulate the slaves. Us Indians are like victims of domestic abuse when it comes to religious and caste based drama. Otherwise it's a nice country to live in until we choose to speak for these victims. I'm a upper caste. They can simply come up with targeted reservations to increase the lc representatives in the end obviously there are gonna be more amount of general representatives simply because of the population ratio. Why is there a need for reservation in entrance exams: that's just exposing the youth to discrimination of opportunities and favouritism. i don‚Äôt know what you mean. my point was that casteism is deeply tied to south asian culture regardless of whichever religion you belong to lol. even NRI‚Äôs practise casteism in western countries. it‚Äôs an inherent part of our cukture Nobody treat manuscript as a law of conduct you idiot. It's outdated. No good brother you are just gonna be downvoted by these blind biased ppl Both are drunkards, I have sympathy for none. Including any book in syllabus makes us hate it more. Atleast thats true for most students. I love reading novels. But I‚Äôll never touch David Copperfield, Shakespeare books, Three Men In A Boat, etc. just because I was forced to study them when I didn‚Äôt love reading novels. I resent these books. What irks me the most about it is that people have the gall to justify things like this in the name of \"tradition\" and \"culture\". I feel like India could be so much more if people just acknowledged these issues and worked on changing things. But we know that will never happen because \"caste\" Caste system has ruined this country!! That's not the fault of that st girl That's the fault of the reservation system. It allows undeserving candidates to join. Many friends of mine who are more privileged than me in terms of money etc get better clgs with a way lesser rank because of their caste. I didn't. Caste-based discrimination happens all over India. It's true even some Indians have peed in airoplanes too I am not denying caste but I think economic condition and education also plays a big role. The man has has the audacity to pee on another human because the other person is a beggar and powerless. He would not dare to pee on a lower caste person from a higher socio-economic status. You cannot post this here since it is not related to India. And don't bring up the argument by mentioning the title Adding not from India doesn't justify this. This is exactly how karmawhores and karmawhoring posts creeps into subreddits and destroys it's identity. you so dense. No need to read it now coz it's imprinted on indians irrespective of caste and religion. It's our Kulcha. Why you think pravesh Shukla peed on the tribal man? If the benefits of reservation were being availed by the kind of person in this picture, no one would have a problem with it. But everyone knows reservation is being used by lower caste people of higher socio-economic status, so the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. That's the problem with reservation. And don't talk to me about creamy bracket. Anybody who is not a salaried employee can easily fudge their tax return status to qualify for reservation even now. Knows nothing about hinduism, continues to blabber abt it ü§ì I am by no means a historian or sociologist. I am claiming no expertise in the subject matter that relates caste and Manusmriti. My understanding of the matter comes from books and articles that I have read. I googled a few for you; [1](https://thewire.in/caste/manusmriti-history-discrimination-constitution) [2](https://thewire.in/caste/symbols-serve-oppressors-that-is-why-manu-must-fall) [3](https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/understanding-manusmriti-women-text/) Just wait for BUSLIMs to vanish and then the top 3% will make the life one cannot imagine for the OBC, SC, STs, Because he's an asshole? Drunk person urinated on another drunk person is not a new news. I think it‚Äôs mostly cuz there‚Äôs so many little problems here that is obviously not gonna be resolved anytime soon, so it results in people venting out their problems on anything and everything. They love to create fake enemies to feel superior. So high caste deem low caste as enemies. Hindus deem muslims as enemies and so on. That gives them a purpose in life, in an otherwise shitty country with not many options. Harmless recreational hobbies aren‚Äôt as popular here like in the west. Lack of good quality jobs is another reason. Good quality jobs means better standards of living, and if a person is fulfilled they‚Äôre less likely to engage in petty behaviour Rather than actually focusing on improving the country they do all this shit. Bhakt spotted. Cry harder >serving maid/other blue collar workers in a different glass, making them sit on the floor rather than the sofa, This is textbook classism ... Dont confuse it with caste India is classist first... Manusmriti sun ke Teri gand jal gayi It is still very very common in India. Most privileged people who are upper caste try their best to hide this side of the country. And the government infact incentivises such behaviour. Only this case was taken seriously because it got a lot of attention and elections are near. With this regime. This country is becoming a shithole full of hate crimes. With upper caste being at the top Bro, in first article they said about aryans etc. Well I guess the aryan invasion theory is not proven so I ll leave it, you want to go for it you can. But I meant to ask you that, have you ever encountered anyone following manusmriti etc in real life. I am from North India, kind of religious family to a large extent. When I heard about manusmriti I was surprised to know such things exist,..... And rn I am 24 and never heard this name from anyone in my family or people around me. And out of curiosity I started asking everyone-- from where they got to know about Manusmriti and to my surprise everyone heard about it from Internet etc and never seen anyone reading or following manusmriti in real life. It's out of curiosity- I don't believe on internet etc now. Everything is full of propaganda no one is keeping their stuff neutral or unbiased. Many people dont want to hear this, but discrimination based on caste is a major factor to why Hindus have historically converted en masse to Christianity and Islam. Talk past it. The person urinating in the video has been arrested stripped down of his post and his house has been destroyed. How is that relevant to anything? Which is wrong. Governments is misusing their powers by destroying his house. Lol. Most sc st crimes are done by OBCs Yes I seriously don't think crime is something to lol about. Which textbook do you follow? Certainly not the constitution, nor the SC judgements. Bro wrong subreddit. It sub is filled with anti nationalists who hate that they are born in India and like about this. This is like 1/10000th case. Even rarer than racial discrimination faced by blacks in america by white people. Also please conform that was it was a caste issue? Like lower caste do have special privilege by government. They can sue upper caste and they will face penalty without trial. So dont worry and ignore all other answers. Like the constitution of India is written by someone belonging to lower caste. Half story. Many upper cast Brahmin groups soon came up. And \"rewarded\" the family to rebuild the house. Of course who doesn't want it?? In a country with 1.4 billion people ret@rds like him exist... See, equal representation is a means to remedy the damage caused by caste based discrimination. The longer we discriminate, the longer we will need to have reservations. The faster we get them out, the faster we can sunset reservations. Point is that you shouldn‚Äôt sunset reservations because it‚Äôs not going to contribute to tangible benefit. Source? sob bhalo to dada? amader rajje j roj lok morche. Fair enough but I‚Äôm guessing the correlation between caste and class is high ? Op is a Turkish barbarian working for Umma propaganda. Amrit Kaal(Kartavvya Kaal) reservations should uplift the poor among the lower castes not make the already affluent families even richer, right? most reservation is utilised by urban middle class LC families while the poor stay poor. reservation should go to the poor among the LC to uplift them but that barely happens. Tribal people are not \"minorities\" Ab aur argument khatam ho gaye? Is caste and discrimination based on it still alive in India is akin to asking do humans still breathe oxygen. Ps. Visit r/IndiaAgainstCasteism Because India is a vast country with various religions, caste culture, ethnicity, languages we take pride in our unity in diversity which is diminishing everyday when it comes to incidence like this there is deep rooted discrimination in India but more so in rural India and this kind of behaviour is definitely not accepted and its not common in India political parties take advantage of the diversity by dividing us further by favouring certain castes religion and states and these kind of thing persists due to lack of education and global exposure. The Man is in jail currently and the victim got a shawl from cm Firstly, I really don't understand what you mean by \"aryan invasion theory is not proven\". A supreme court judge is unlikely to publish hogwash on a national platform that can be disproved by any undergrad history student. I appreciate and applaud your skepticism though. We should all aspire to practice honest and rigorous skepticism towards all things new. I get that this subject is not something in our daily conversations with our friends, families or colleagues but I hope that you feel the need to know more about this matter. Perhaps read that book I was recommending? As for \"noone reads or follows Manusmriti in real life\", let me link a [real life tragedy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/Khairlanji-verdict-blind-to-dalit-cause/articleshow/6242212.cms) that casteism entails. When you are saying \"neutral\" and \"unbiased\" are you sure you don't mean to just keep the status quo? No. This never happened. It's clearly a fake video. If it *did* happen, it was only a prank. Some \"sources\" are saying that it was all due to Nehru. It may also be a plan by Rahul Gandhi or the CIA, to blacken India's image in the West. Even if this were 100% correct, please know that the perpetrator has nothing to do with any political party. Please also ignore any evidence that shows him working for a specific party. **Everything is Fine.** You're a special kind of asshole, aren't you? He was only arrested because the video went viral. So what we want, is for EVERY incident like this to go viral, because that seems to be the only way these fuckers get punished. Also. The bulldozing thing? It's a shit tactic used by the BJP to show how \"effective\" they are at punishing people accused of crimes. It literally goes against everything we base our code of laws and justice on. >Voltaire umm Ramkrishna, Vivekananda, Vidya Sagar Bengali Hindus tried their best though, even Chaitanya mahaprabhu and many prominent Bramho ex-Hindu intellectuals all dissed Hindu malpractices and reformed society as much as they could through education, secularism and speaking against caste discrimination. Remind me to piss on your head, the next time you're drunk, then. **Ass.** The incident is true. Certain parts of the country still have people treating the backward classes badly (badly is a euphemism) The perpetrators are booked under SC/ST act which is non bailable, In this particular case, 1. Perpetrator booked under several sections, including the NSA act 2. The perpetrator's illegal house was demolished 3. The Chief minister of the state got the victim to his house, washed his feet, and had lunch with him, to apologise to him on the behalf of society. That said, discrimination is prevalent mainly in rural areas, and the actions taken are subject to local police. The incident is true and shameful. Further investigation revealed that the person who peed on the victim was in a drunken state Not trying to save him, but just trying to tell that upper caste isn't the one to be blamed -- a few buggers do it and all are tarnished. Ok lets a book your ticket to France I am an ST u dumb fuck, do u really think it is possible to stop every incident?? Have some common sense , centuries of casteism doesn't just end in decades....secondly get some iq instead of shit in ur brain.. there are other ways to take action too instead of believing that only virality could get justice .... ... How Manusmriti is related to this case? I don't get it? When I say unbiased or neutral I meant everything is grey in this world nothing is black and white but the sources on internet is either on black side or white side. That is just to exploit the Netizens political ideology not to actually share the information or make a constructive information. Many things can be explained by average country IQs. Some have suggested reading news to know more. Whatever you read is true, but more. Only these sort of extreme cases come up on news. All the subtle or minor issues which aren't extreme enough to show up on news, are the majority and common occurrence. More than racism, it's intouchability that's a huge issue. Some castes are considered too low to even touch. Any person from higher caste would take a bath and wash the clothes if a low caste person touches them. If anyone causes them such \"inconvenience\", they get very irritated, and either scold them or even beat them. God forbid if a low and a high caste person get romantically attached. The low caste one definitely dies, sometimes the high caste person is also killed. Mostly by their own parents. Coz their kids have lowered their \"honor\" in the society. They call it honor killing. Peeing is still one of the decent activity. Since the peeing person was a popular politician, this issue caught more attention. Some incidents are too disturbing even by reddit standards. Have you read Vivekananda? or about Vivekananda? Voltaire he is far away from. Most Hindus don't even know about the content of Manusmriti and could care less. Only radical elements would seek to promote such an outdated text. Swear to god i‚Äôd fuck his shit up if I saw this happening with my own eyes I have no idea if you're really \"ST\" or you're simply claiming that. The fact of the matter is, in every single case where people with power are punished, it is because the matter went public. Are you really unaware of this? When incidents like this go viral, then the perpetrators are likely to be punished. That's a good thing. I made ZERO claims about being able to stop every incident, or ending casteism. So you're trying to attack a position I simply don't hold. Download Any Image and Video from Threads app just in one click [Thread Downloader](https://www.threadsdownloader.in/) The point here is that this was done by a privileged human being to a poor person and the video is distressing taking into consideration we feel like beating the hell out of that fat guy who did that to a poor lad who was just minding his own business. Please do not bring caste and culture between all this shit. That fat guy needs to be punished at all costs but I think he has a bad mentality, nothing to do with caste here. This wasn't okay even if done to a higher caste or some other religion guy thank god thats never going to happen keep dreaming you disgusting freaks i am glad your worthless incompetent idol is dead. The constitution did not envisage for legalizing endless discrimination my friend. thats just because youre a shudra its obvious reading must be hard for you. iirc david copperfield does have some pictures though They both were drunk High caste bro really need to develop some fashion sense It is true Just be rich, if you are rich you will face less issues there is a stark divide between the rich and poor in big cities and the thing which your low caste brain thinks is caste discrimination has more class and economic undertones at best and is justifiable. manusmriti is the one which states how we are all divided into castes that's how it's related to this case and honestly how is this actually in the grey though? have you actually ever heard anyone profiting from the caste system other than brahmins and other ucs? why is it that these castes are given privilege just based on the fact that they were born so? it's not a black and white matter when there is discrimination going on with people being treated as untouchables, getting less resources and opportunities why? just because of their birth. if you choose to stay unbiased or neutral that means you're allowing this to happen you're just on the side of the perpetrator. Someone crying against reservation is the same as a white man crying against black laws. Anyways be rich Again not to the same extent as it does in the North. But dont change the goalpost. You used MP's government as an example to a question about India. What's more surprising is the person is question is a friend/subordinate of the local elected representative. So, we can say that its systemic. I'm sorry if this is a stupid or insulting question, but how do you know what specific caste you belong to? You say you are neighbours, so in most cultures that would mean you probably have quite similar socioeconomic status. to be honest i should disregard your wothless low caste opinion at the fact that you refer to one of the most disgusting and unpatriotic indian who ever lived but id still like to add india has had numerous scientific and philosphical achievements notably by brahmins and the way you need to compare it with a european figure clealry showcases your inferiority and contempt for \" your country \". there have been tons of \"voltaire brahmins\" but what about one successful or toppe dalit who has achieved something on his own despite being given 70 years of affirmative action ? yes, radical elements of the current ruling party have promoted the manusmriti on MULTIPLE occasions. much of our population IS radical with respect to religion. So here goes..... \"Besides Mr. Gandhi, many others have adversely criticised my views as expressed in my speech. But I have felt that in taking notice of such adverse comments, I should limit myself to Mr. Gandhi. This I have done not because what he has said is so weighty as to deserve a reply, but because to many a Hindu he is an oracle, so great that when he opens his lips it is expected that the argument must close and no dog must bark. But the world owes much to rebels who would dare to argue in the face of the pontiff and insist that he is not infallible. I do not care for the credit which every progressive society must give to its rebels. I shall be satisfied if I make the Hindus realise that they are the sick men of India, and that their sickness is causing danger to the health and happiness of other Indians.\" \\- Preface to the Second Edition, 1937; Annihilation of Caste by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar &#x200B; \"Why have the mass of people tolerated the social evils to which they have been subjected? There have been social revolutions in other countries of the world. Why have there not been social revolutions in India, is a question which has incessantly troubled me. There is only one answer which I can give, and it is that the lower classes of Hindus have been completely disabled for direct action on account of this wretched caste system. They could not bear arms, and without arms they could not rebel. They were all ploughmen - or rather, condemned to be ploughmen - and they never were allowed to convert their ploughshares into swords. They had no bayonets, and therefore everyone who chose, could and did sit upon them. On account of the caste system, they could receive no education. They could not think out or know the way to their salvation. They were condemned to be lowly; and not knowing the way of escape, and not having the means of escape, they became reconciled to eternal servitude, which they accepted as their inescapable fate.\" \\- 17.5, Annihilation of Caste, An Undelivered Speech, 1936; Dr. B. R. Ambedkar arey batao mujhe, tell me how the manusmriti is outdated and how it is a product of its times and all that. please, do tell. nobody has ever said that before i‚Äôm about to go deep dive because i don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. there goes my work breakü§ì OH wait THAT sadhguruüò≠üò≠ i didn‚Äôt know this was his full name. he‚Äôs so annoyingüò≠ chalo meri break bach gayi you stupid idiot its just human nature men considered lowly or of low profession , race etc is treated differently for example peasents , serfs of europe , blacks in america its not some unique indian phenomenon . It is. India is underhated racist country Caste is determined by birth. You inherit the caste of your family. >Again not to the same extent as it does in the North. Based on what statistics? >But dont change the goalpost. Mate there is no goalpost. It's a discussion, not a football match. > You used MP's government as an example to a question about India. I'm assuming you didn't read the description of this post and jumped straight to the comments section, because this is just a stupid point. Also, I'm checking out of this conversation. This is not what I want to spend my time on. Bye. I'm assuming you can marry up or down? Or maybe buy your way up? Yes, quite. But also there are lots of poor upper-caste people and lots of rich lower-caste people. I've but have you read about all the names I mentioned? all of them were brahmins or ex-brahmins who couldn't stand their religion and reformed it in their own distinct ways, and that is just 4-5 men from the top of my head from Bengal alone (there are many south Indian reformers I'm not well informed about). My point is generalization done for whatever reason is always factually incorrect, be it Ambedkar generalizing religion, a ch@ddi generalizing muslims or Marx generalizing class.(I'm an ex-muslim btw). Put dalits on an equitable scale in Brahmin dominated society, and they will trump Brahmins within five decades. Can't buy your way up. However if you're rich, chances of caste-based discrimination are significantly lower. Inter-caste marriages happen a lot, but some are subjected to hate crimes. One inherits the caste of the father in that case. America abolished Reservations (Affirmative action) recently. There is no such thing as Black laws. He's just a drunk idiot. well isnt that whats happening rn and even with additional benefits dalits have not been able to trump brahmins in seven decades what are you talking about loser? won't consider your opinion as you are a member of Desi meta sub Or because you're dumb and you know nothing about shit you're Taking about So if a woman has a child with a lower caste man, the child will essentially \"lose\" caste... It certainly has a lot in common with just being born poor or rich in other countries resulting in priviledge or prejudice but... Castes sound much much more rigid. It's pretty clear it was always just a way to keep the masses oppressed. Bhagare mora poshur deho niye kukure aar shokune ja kore, sara rajje tai cholche. Ekta schooler chhatro boma kheye mara geche.

Anon, just forget about this thread for a while and go read Three Men in a Boat (again). Laughter increases life expectancy, I promise. Instead of doing something good, the govt just made caste reservations for seats in universities and jobs in India. The thing about knowing caste is that it‚Äôs basically represented by your surname(Last Name). You just have to tell your full name for people to know which caste you‚Äôre from(those who know which last name is for which caste). ok thanks I assume any name that falls outside the established names (like if I as a European moved to India and had a family) is just automatically lowest caste, then? Vivekananda wasn't a Brahmin though. The others mentioned at the beginning were. Vivekanands was named Narendranath Dutta at birth. It is üíØ true, don't stereotype. It is not happening in every nuke and corner. Sadly these types of events do happen every now and then. The person has been booked by police and technically it will be hard for him to get out as the sections charged against him are non bailable. The chief minister of the state went down to the victim's house and apologize and washed his legs which to me is a strong message. The Indian government was and is doing things to eradicate the caste system, it won't be as easy as it sounds because of the deep roots. To give you a hypothetical example: you are driving and your car accidentally hits a person you will be charged for rash driving or negligent driving or something along those lines. Now if the person you hit happens to the scheduled caste or tribe you will be booked for at least 2 more sessions which make things harder for you. But India being India, you have to pay more bribes in the case of the latter compared to the former. And we have more challenges in uplifting them as it is hard to win confidence of tribal people. Educating them is challenging, and they are unaware of their rights and additional privileges they have. But this video is not about casteism. That guy who is pissing is the right hand of some neta politician, and after being drunk he is doing it power ka nanga nach (showing his power). The person sitting is mentally challenged tribal.In India media find caste angle in everything. MP's CM has demolished that guys house who is pissing as a punishment and he is in jail. It is more rampant and frequent than one could possibly imagine. That 100% true that the another side of India I swear, man. His organisation is also up to shady shit. I have a problem with everyone suggesting things that \"should be\" taught in school! Don't you people remember how hectic it was mugging up whatever is taught in school already? And learning from what is taught in school is another can of worms. Most people forget things taught in school 1 hour after exam. Is it meaningful to teach everything, without understanding, to students, because we find it important in later and still struggle to learn? But much of our population is ignorant regarding this scripture. I'm damn sure most people haven't read or can't even quote anything regarding this scripture. Heck, most people don't even know the popular scriptures properly you expect them to care about something so obscure? Radical elements are the loudest doesn't mean they are the biggest. (In terms of Indian population) ManuSmriti is a product of a bygone era and it should stay that way. you're a foreigner you won't experience casteism Right, but let's say I have a child with an Indian woman, what would happen to that child? Over representation? The seats supposedly for marginalized? This sounds eerily like communism. Yes everyone should have equal opportunities for a job and everything, but if i extend this idea of yours to the wider world, you mean to say that since we have about 20% of the world's population, we should also have 20% of everyone's wealth? Should we go around taking everyone's wealth and keeping them for us just because that would give us more representation? How brainwashed are you lad? And now I can clearly see that the effect of \"casteism\" has truly come down in our society(albeit it still exists). But the poor people with ambitions and talent are still not being taken care of, they're just treated as nothing more than votebanks and fed into this meatgrinder of a political system. What should happen to them? Most of them are of lower castes. So why should the kids who clearly have monetary advantage take away the chances of these poor and aspiring kids? And as far as Mrs. President goes, whats the problem with her? Did she go on Twitter and rant about the new parliament building(as is probably being referenced by you?) Caste, unlike class, is different. Your class is determined by your socioeconomic factors like family income. Caste, on the other hand, is inherited from male parent. Your caste will be the same as that of your father. Far as I know he's related to politics My bad, I knew that but I'm not good with surnames, they get especially confusing when some of them belong to multiple castes and even religion at times. nothing he would just be like an exotic creature to people being half white he wouldn't go through casteism more like people would be curious about him instead That's interesting. Nope. It was mostly around groups of people and what they do. In ancient India we had 4 major castes or Varnas. Brahmins - These were the teachers ( kind of ) and priests. Vaishyas - These were the business men Kshatriyas - These were the warriors and rulers Shudras - All other people, people who did jobs for others. People who are considered lower caste today. Over centuries and milleniums, caste has been deformed and been used for political agendas by various rulers, including the British and current Indian political parties. Sub castes were formed and castes were divided into upper, lower. Even same caste has upper sub castes and lower sub castes. Things got fkd up. Even today a lot of state and central elections are fought on the basis of caste. But caste discrimination is mellowing down gradually. Esp in Tier 1, 2 cities people don't care much about caste now. Intercaste marriages are common now, however, many people from other 3 castes still avoid marrying a Shudra. Our Prime Minister and lots of other ministers belong to lower caste. Almost 20-30% or more people in government jobs, administrative job are from lower castes. Governments have lots of policies to support lower castes, for example getting a seat in best colleges of India or getting best administrative jobs in India might be a lot easier for a lower caste person than an upper caste person of same financial status. Every country has issues. Good thing is we are fighting against it and getting better day by day ( atleast I believe so ) Edit. - Why the downvotes guys ? If there is something wrong about the info I provided then correct me. It is unfortunately true. Albeit rare, stuff like this happens in India. Illiterate POS are all over the place, much like antivaxxers and flat-earthers in The US. A Gujarat High Court judge literally cited Manusmriti as one of the reasons to deny abortion to a rape victim. Please, keep pretending as if it has no significance today. Looking at America, the fight against institutionalised racism has been very good the past 50 years, but is suddenly regressing lately. I hope you get to a point where castes are considered nothing but a historical thing eventually, but regression is always possible even when it's looking good. I'd say that's more of how the education system is designed to make students mug up the syllabus as opposed to critically think about it. It happens, though it's not that high in urban states but man rural places can be hell hole depending on where you end up in. Tho some are better than others but u can still feel discrimination. What sucks is tho govt is not doing much in order to rein this in. Reservation and protection of law for slurs used against them is not enough, they don't even solve the root cause of problem and in many cases is just making it worse by fighting fire against fire. Hope govt does better in education front to curb the discrimination. Caste rigidity still exists between orthodox indians. Sad It's true. You can't eliminate caste if it's being asked everywhere from school to ration card to job. As long as caste is apparent, there will be these a**holes who want to show their upper caste authority or from the other end those who want to take revenge for the past. Unfortunately both exist and will continue to exist until u have benefits being offered to one and telling the other they are 'superior' - very typical caste politics, made popular by the British and Portugese. When the Govt has spent 70 years focusing on people's caste, it will continue to perpetuate, especially from the educated illiterates. Ironically \"jyaati bhed\" which is the origin of caste system used to have 100s of jyaati - including mixed jyaati between people of different Varna making it harder to say 1 caste is lower than the other. Humans always have to tendency to make separation based on something. In India it‚Äôs caste system, if these two people were to go outside India, it would be ‚Äúus indians‚Äù and them. Unless everyone wake up and digest the fact that everyone is from Africa, the time is not that far away that earth will become a living hell for Homo sapiens. The humour in that book is drier than a whole ass desert The Current regime is busy in encouraging these kind of heinous acts more. Bcoz the more gap they create in society more are the chances of them winning the upcoming general elections. It is 100% true and the person who did that horrible act is also a party member of the current governing party. It used to be based on profession. That isn't the case anymore unfortunately. Nothing to do with caste, some humans are just as***les It is true. Well the bulldozer law has spoken on it so maybe now okayy > obviously there are gonna be more amount of general representatives simply because of the population ratio. General caste is the minority in the population. > Based on what statistics? Nine states accounted for 84% of all crimes against Dalits india in 2019 though they accounted for only 54% of the country‚Äôs SC population, according to data just released by the National Crime Records Bureau. The highest rates (number of crimes for every lakh population of Dalits) were in Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat. > Mate there is no goalpost. It's a discussion, not a football match. Discussions are based around a point. Goalpost is a metaphor for that, this is basic English, keep up. There is already a song about this behaviour: It already is for most of us. And unfortunately Africa doesn‚Äôt have the best track record of peaceful coexistence, pre or post colonialism. Do you also complain when the runner in the outer track gets to start ahead of a runner in the inner track? Yes caste based violence is real and prevalent. Lots of rapes and murders and even mass killings. Lol, and you go to places with affirmative action. > does the son still deserve further reservations? Do you think the person who pissed on the ST dude wouldn't have pissed on him if his dad was from a premier institute? Just because there was a warped logic behind the system centuries ago doesn't mean it was justified then. Caste is and has always been a tool to oppress the masses. Who is fighting against it? Most upper caste millennials in bigger cities just ignore the problem at best and only bring it up when complaining about reservations. It's still rampant in most of the country and could be getting worse for all we know. This affirmative action came from reservation It is still a mentality in older people. New generation doesn't care about caste and mostly does not disrespect other castes as there isn't simply enough knowledge of caste hierarchy floating around now. And saying it is a BJP employee might be just a simple effort to malign the govt. name and nothing else. The only thing the new generation is worried about regarding caste is unfair reservation and nothing else(imo). The man was arrested, if he wasn't, that would have been proof that the govt. or hindu religion supports discrimination. But clearly, that was a thing of the past(like 1000 years ago) and now everyone equally hates discrimination except those people who can benefit from reservation(the undeserving kind). IMO, No reservation except EWS and PWD should be there. This Man was Drunk. Yes, and you cry about reservation because it didn't benefit you, while you run to countries with affirmative actions that benefit you, meanwhile whining all the way about \"deserving and undeserving\". Indeed it can regress and political parties always try to make sure it does. Let's hope for the best. Let the world be a better place to live in. Just find out which one there favourite restaurant is. And casually drop that the cook is dalit or something. Strange segue... But, In a way, yes. The point of reservation is upliftment of people from the lower caste communities. The piss dude is not doing that just because the other guy is from a low caste. He's in a lower socioeconomic strata and that is what is giving the guy his misplaced sense of superiority. A generation above with the kind of opportunities a premier institution would give would have uplifted the family to a better condition, and that guy would not be where he is right now.(That is the point of reservation from what I understand). Wow, love his clarity of thought, and eloquence! Casteism is real. I have to caveat it by saying it has reduced over the past few decades but not without the initiatives of the government or the local organisations working towards eliminating any and all forms of discrimination. Our constitution has provisions in fundamental rights that promote equality and prevent untouchability (article 15 and 17) and promotes \"affirmative action\" towards vulnerable sections (article 16(4)). Other than that, we have a whole ministry - Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment dedicated to looking after the social justice needs of scheduled castes among other vulnerable sections. It has National commission for scheduled castes (NCSC) which looks at the needs and aspirations of SCs and works in their best interests and has financial institutions dedicated to cater to their specific financial development needs called National scheduled castes finance and development corporation (NSCFDC). There are other acts and provisions in place (I don't remember all of them tho). For instance, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 which is used widely by the police to take required action against any and all atrocities against SCs. That said, these provisions still have to be executed to its fullest extent but I think more than that, there is a need for a collective mindset shift. I hope whoever this idiot is, gets punished to the fullest extent of law. edit: imo, there are multiple reasons/angles as to why despite global advancement in the understanding of human rights, we still have something as disgusting as caste discrimination still alive: - lack of awareness - socio-political reasons (politics surrounding castes) - cultural reasons (religion, customs, etc that have promoted discrimination \"varna system\" from centuries) - rigidity to change among the even educated ones - colonial hangover (which has given Indians a weird inferiority but superiority complex), and there are multiple other reasons that I'm sure I've missed. In any case, it's sad and aggravating to say the least and it needs to change asap. I'm glad to see that atleast our generation (atleast a part of it) is moving past this nonsense and treating everyone equally. Its very true. > He's in a lower socioeconomic strata Plenty of recorded atrocities where the victim wasn't in a lower economic strata. If anything they amplified because the lower castes \"were getting uppity\". > and that guy would not be where he is right now.(That is the point of reservation from what I understand). No, it's to fill in positions with more lower castes in accordance to the population, so that the chances of discrimination decrease as well as available help increases to other lower caste people. \"Fixing\" by getting lower caste people away from their localities is like saying people leaving India \"fixes\" it. Well the question is always going to be how much is this ‚Äúlots‚Äù ? As I mentioned, another comment here. The only criteria to sunset reservations would be when the reservations have no tangible effect on the representation. I wouldn't be taking reservations because I have enough money. Only PWD and ews should be benefited by reservations. Reservations should not be based on castes. U bloody castiest. I got to know about these castes only because of reservation. I got to know that I belong to a privileged caste ( reservation isn't there for this caste so it's privileged according to u guys) Caste based discrimination is starting because of this caste based reservation shit. > I got to know about these castes only because of reservation. That's your problem, not anyone else's. Might want to not sleep during history and civics classes next time. > Caste based discrimination is starting because of this caste based reservation shit. Ah yes, because caste based reservations have been around for the past 2000 years, right? It's a good thing someone with your level of intellect didn't manage to get into a good college lmao. its true but what has any of the governments in past 70 years done to remove it ? BJP is pissing on the poor people and we are just taking it Its a sad state of affairs that the court cites judgment using an old text which is of no significance in today's era. Manu smriti is said to have been written in 1-3 century CE. The fact that the judge is quoting such an old text to talk about something which has happened at present puts questions on the mental faculties of the judge. Talking about the Indian judiciary and its judgements is like opening a whole can of worms. My point is in our **average day to day life** Manusmriti isn't considered important at all. Except some idiotic and radical elements want to bring it back to prevalence. And I sincerely hope such plans never come to fruition. Any links to online copies of both these books? I'd like to read and learn more. Obviously not, but wouldn't you prefer if all tracks were straight? Or are you just about creating inequality and compensating with victim privileges. Sure, but that doesn't mean I'm going to pretend the track is straight when it isn't. Complain about the track not being straight first before complaining outer runners get to start ahead. I was caught lying? JFC Or atleast try to tackle the root cause of a problem rather than being content with giving out a discriminatory privileges. Maybe you would very much like if someone as competent as you in every physical aspect has to run a 100 meter while you have to cover a mile. Cuz that's what happening. Oh but thats guys great great grandfather had a broken leg, so now its justified. Lmao >It's a good thing someone with your level of intellect didn't manage to get into a good college lmao. I've given sat and joining cambridge. fuck u again 100 percent. These things won‚Äôt even make news and when it does - we try to pass it off as an isolated incident and that we are actually better and caste less. We care more about the image of being a caste less society than actually being a caste less society. Housing discrimination for example, it‚Äôs just so widespread in the cities itself. It‚Äôs not an abstract concept you had to go out of your way to be educated about - it‚Äôs tangible and present all around us. We just had to be real.. You can't marry up or down, it doesn't change after marriage. One way to change caste if you're under 18 is to get legally adopted by someone of a different caste then you will get their caste on certificates. If you convert from another religion to Hinduism then you won't really have a caste and will be considered under general category. India has serious issues with this because of their caste system (as do other South Asian countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh) Some castes are born to rule and others to serve. Marriage between castes causes lynchings and murders. It's so ingrained into the cultures of these countries, I do not believe there is any solution. My friend is facing caste based discrimination in New York ! Everywhere we go somehow instead of asking their name, the full name is important. It's so deeply imprinted on people the need to ask the surname to just ascertain the caste before a single word out of their mouth. Koi bahar se aake Indians me ek bande ke behaviour ko dekh k generalize krgya or koi uspe kuch nahi keh rha ? It‚Äôs true bro‚Ä¶he is brahman the so called upper caste and the victim is from indigenous tribe‚Ä¶it‚Äôs very common in india‚Ä¶ Insulated from discrimination my foot. Tamil Nadu instituted anti-Brahminism officially in 1919 under the Justice Party. One grandfather, after graduating at the top of his class could not get any jobs in TN, and had to move to another state to work as a clerk. That job took him to Pakistan during partition, where Muslim mobs killed everyone around him in the compartment. The other grandfather's side of the family went to Kolkata for the same reason. My father joined a bank, where a spurious charge of corruption was levied because he was a Brahmin. It took nearly a decade and a thorough CBI investigation to clear his name, and he lost a promotion. My mom was rejected from one of the colleges she applied for because she was a Brahmin. I have uncles who recount how in medical school in the 60s some proctors used to run their hand on their back trying to see if they had the holy thread and would fail them if they felt it. I grew up hearing things like \"if you see a Brahmin and a snake, kill the Brahmin first\". When there were far fewer college seats in the early to mid 90s reservation meant that 50% of the college seats and government jobs were closed to me. That was in Maharashtra. For my brother, in TN in the late 80s it was 69% reservation. That meant that we had to score an entire **standard deviation** or more higher than someone from a reserved category of caste to get into a good program. That meant a ton of sacrifices for our parents and drudgery and a pressure to succeed from early on, because failures cost a lost. That constant pressure had various adverse effects. --------------------------------------------- The majority of Tamil Brahmin families have left Tamil Nadu because of discrimination and many of us left India. It took a toll to overcome the discrimination, but it helped us succeed where ever we went. My maternal uncle repeatedly says the discrimination he faced *as a dark skinned Indian in Detroit in the 1960s* was nothing compared to the discrimination he faced in India. We do well because of in our families multiple older generations worked hard and and with disciple and sacrificed to help future generations succeed. Did not face discrimination my foot. >Plenty of recorded atrocities where the victim wasn't in a lower economic strata. That is just 'whataboutery' (Google it if you are not familiar) >it's to fill in positions with more lower castes in accordance to the population, so that the chances of discrimination decrease as well as available help increases to other lower caste people. The point of decreasing discrimination and increasing help available to lower caste people IS upliftment. You're just describing a part of the process in more detail. And I frankly have no clue where I said that lower caste people should be taken away from their locality or anything of the sort. Yeah sure. And I'm the professor at Cambridge about to flunk your ass. > Or atleast try to tackle the root cause of a problem rather than being content with giving out a discriminatory privileges. It isn't an exclusive deal. Casteism needs to be dismantled while those suffering in the casteist system get equalizing benefits. > Oh but thats guys great great grandfather had a broken leg, so now its justified. So is the current athlete's leg, but I guess you're too blind to see that, instead content to whine about \"dalit friend with 200 BMWs\". I don't really know where to get e-book versions of these. Searching might help. You can buy both from amazon, if you like, [here](https://www.amazon.in/Annihilation-Caste-Annotated-Critical-Ambedkar/dp/818905967X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=R2N623DX3582&keywords=annihilation+of+caste+br+ambedkar&qid=1688731829&sprefix=annihilation+of+caste%2Caps%2C639&sr=8-2) and [here](https://www.amazon.in/Laws-Manu-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140445404/ref=sr_1_9?crid=29ZOQG99ZQ8J4&keywords=manusmriti+in+english&qid=1688731750&sprefix=Manusmriti%2Caps%2C1313&sr=8-9). > That is just 'whataboutery' (Google it if you are not familiar) Take your own advice. Whataboutery only applies when I bring up unrelated shit. Bringing up caste atrocities meted out purely because of caste isn't \"whataboutery\". It literally is an example of how casteism doesn't stop just because lower caste climbed up an economic strata. > You're just describing a part of the process in more detail. I meant it as in its an ongoing process, not \"one and done\" kind of deal. > And I frankly have no clue where I said that lower caste people should be taken away from their locality or anything of the sort. Here: > and that guy would not be where he is right now >Whataboutery only applies when I bring up unrelated shit. Bringing up atrocities towards higher socioeconomic strata was unrelated. >Here Seriously?! Are you really saying you didn't understand that I meant situation and not place?! You probably don't understand India's obsession with white skin, but it's really toxic. Advertisement about cream making a person's skin \"whiter\" while inherently depicting darker skin as ugly is so common. These Ads would be cancelled yesterday in any other country. Sir , what he said is a practical and prevalent thing and this is how it is potrayed. Here is someone who doesn't understand casteism nor communism. \" what Indian government is going to do to destroy it \" Literally nothing. BAPS used forced Dalit labor to build their temples in America. > Bringing up atrocities towards higher socioeconomic strata was unrelated. You claimed that atrocities would be solved with just one generation of reservations: > Strange segue... But, In a way, yes. And when I pointed out that it clearly doesn't, it's somehow unrelated and whataboutery? Also what's with the willfully trying to confuse \"socioeconomic\" and \"economic\"? > Seriously?! Are you really saying you didn't understand that I meant situation and not place?! And how exactly would the situation improve just because his father got into a premier institute? 5 trillion economy old ass My parents / grandparents were fairly religious and had read and own a ton of Hindu religious books. They even contributed to religious magazines. They never knew what was in Manusmriti. The only folks who have owned Manusmriti in the past 100+ years have been atheists or someone who is generally anti-Hindu. Manusmriti one code of conduct among many in Hinduism and was never the the dominant one. It literally dates back to the same era as the similar Code of Hammurabi and is far more liberal than many codes that came up thousands of years later - such as sharia. Also I have read Annihilation of Caste by Dr. Ambedkar several times when I was younger, because I was told how brilliant it was in school. It is tedious, shallow in thought, contains stupendous displays of half baked knowledge and a example of the vileness of internalized racism. It builds nothing and basically sets a path to nihilism. I don't see the appeal of it to anyone other than midwits whose thinking does not extend beyond caste is bad. Read for yourself: Yeah, Ambedkar wanted more extreme measures. Reservations were a compromise. Let's go for those more extreme measures then. Yea. It‚Äôs not normal and yet not absent. It‚Äôs ultimately manifestation of one person feeling superior. ( rings a bell in your doubt that you can‚Äôt clear on Google but have to ask on Reddit ? ) Also it‚Äôs prevalent across the globe.You can watch in porns, and also in torture chambers of your defence Systems. In case you don‚Äôt have it in your society so blatantly clear chances are that you have been rich enough to find time to address all human depravity in your society to make it more acceptable and indoors and contain it too. Or to use the buzz word - have reached to next layer of consciousness. In case you have, you are from one of those countries and cultures who were doing it before on what you call third world people, and are doing it now too from your financial systems which when burst like the baloon they are, we get blessed with this great opportunity to learn something about your bullshit of economics. Chances are that people have picked up that from their masters, the brutal display of power. The display of power till one capitulate, and then some more. So when you saw the video, you knew it was true. We are ashamed and enraged and we took action( that too is not upto holy standards but is great by our standards). So in case you have money - give it back. You don‚Äôt have, its okay too. When you give money keep your morality laced religion up your ass. We don‚Äôt need to learn subservience in sophisticated words. Any further query you have I can address it. End casteism, end reservations. Can't do the first? Live with the second. >You claimed that atrocities would be solved with just one generation of reservations: No... I claimed that it could reduce. I never claimed that 1 generation of reservation would solve anything. >And how exactly would the situation improve just because his father got into a premier institute? You picked 'premier institute' out of an unrelated acecdote which i mentioned in a previous comment which was only about reservation and not about this incident. You connected it to the atrocity. Don't blame that on me. I just continued your thread. And I didn't mean to confuse economic and socioeconomic. As far as I can recollect, i never said economic in my conversation with you. Infact you were the one who brought up economic. I stand corrected if you can quote where I said economic in my conversation with you. Don't try quoting my parent comment where I was talking about something else entirely. . The only time they are allowed inside the shrine, while constructing. > as been booked under the harshest law available in Indian Penal code. Which is what is going to let him off easy. As horrible as the incident and practice is, it's not an issue of national security, which means the judge will throw out the case. Then tell me which caste I am bro. My surname is Dilip param IDGAFüóø Do you not think the fact that most emigrating Indians are Brahmins/upper caste folks as the most obvious sign of privilege? And that you or your ancestors didn't need to work against caste discrimination (which is very very real) on the way to success? There's resentment against Brahmins precisely because they've historically oppressed other classes, and the hatred is sad to see, but you're still better off than many Indians with \"lower caste\" backgrounds lmao the indian gov itself is casteist afüíÄ the ruling bjp-rss lobby has staunch upper caste hindutva supportü§° Not seeing the merit in those excellent works seems like a personal failing you're blaming the school system for. I had Shakespeare in 10th and i still love it So brahmins were peed on face and killed for marrying other caste girls ? Killed for entering temples? Killed for carrying beef? The time period you are mentioning Rajaji was the chief minister and who was he? \"Did you know our life was so bad we had to move to USA\" pretty much sums up the scenario. > No... I claimed that it could reduce. I never claimed that 1 generation of reservation would solve anything. The question was whether the guy who got pissed on wouldn't have been pissed on if his father graduated from a premier institute. And I asked this question because you claim children of parents with money should not get reservation because \"undeserving\" or whatever. You claimed yes, and then when shown it clearly doesn't, you cried whataboutery. If you don't know how stuff works you don't need to dig further in. > You picked 'premier institute' out of an unrelated acecdote which i mentioned in a previous comment which was only about reservation and not about this incident. As if incidents like those have nothing to do with why the country needs reservations in the first place and not based on money in pocket. > And I didn't mean to confuse economic and socioeconomic. As far as I can recollect, i never said economic in my conversation with you. Infact you were the one who brought up economic. Yes, because you're describing economic factors while calling it \"socioeconomic\". A low caste IIT grad isn't socially ahead of a high caste auto driver. Caste system might have been defined based on profession and that too not for discrimination, but division of labour and to help society‚Ä¶. But once it gained momentum and those who had the power of knowledge being handler of gurukuls and khstriya‚Äôs being king , it moved toward birth based and people wanted to retain power and wealth‚Ä¶. This system should have died centuries ago‚Ä¶ In todays world it shall be eradicated , this needs to be exclusively taught from primary school level‚Ä¶so kids can learn and understand what bull shit is this‚Ä¶. But question is which upper caste parent would have courage to do so and also desire to do so ??? My friend in India, process is the punishment :) Dude you‚Äôre expecting the answer from a wrong person. First its a regional thing, and all caste based thing are a part of your regional social structure. No one from Karnataka will come to a Gujrati town/village and do any caste based violence. But go ask your local neighbouring people in your town or village what your caste is and then tell me if they know it or not. Dude three other caste category still avoiding the lower fourth category denotes nothing changed. You read the post about someone peeing on the face in 2023 and thought \"I believe we are improving\" ? lol ok my bad He's a guy with enough connections that he could do this openly, and only had action taken against him because there's video evidence that got circulated on social media. You think the process is going to affect him as much as it does the lesser privileged people? Your name indicates your caste. And weirdly enough, often things like speech mannerisms, clothing, food habits and so on also are indicators of socioeconomic status, education, and yes, caste. It is very difficult to escape. I understand the need for reservation, but positive discrimination is still discrimination because you're lowering the opportunities for a group by giving preferential treatment to another. >You claimed yes, and then when shown it clearly doesn't, I claimed yes and you never showed that it doesn't. You said there are atrocities on people who are not in the lower class either. That is unrelated. >A low caste IIT grad isn't socially ahead of a high caste auto driver. A low caste IIT graduate with a job is ahead of a high caste auto driver in the socioeconomic scale. Refer Kuppuswamy scale and how it is calculated if you have t heard of it. >If you don't know how stuff works you don't need to dig further in Follow your own advice. Things were worse earlier. Things are gradually improving. In my chdhood it used to be more prevalent, even in my own family. Now things are different when I see around. As I said it's my own belief. Yes, it happened and it is already dealt with. The guy was punished and the victim was invited to the CM's house and they did some photo op. Many still think being from upper caste makes things better. He has been arrested. You don't have to read manusmriti to know about it when it's already being practiced in real life. \"Manusmriti is not a dominant code of Hinduism\" 'Annihilation of caste is meh' Alright man! The guy with a broken leg doesn't even know this thread exist. Meanwhile the guy who plays 8 hours of video games and eats pizzas daily says thanks for help. Such fatties do exist. Isn't it miraculous? And in a sample space of 140cr people, finding a few thousand of those every year isn't very difficult. I have run and won the race so I have seen the things up close. Your ideal victim still isn't here and the \"doesn't exist in your imaginary world guy\" is still eating a pizza knowing some delusional people have his back. Na it's samme all over we treat based on caste and you treat based on color Other than examples of the two gounders that you mentioned can you show quotes from the Dravidian government or chief ministers who have glorified caste? Or what had happened to the people who have glorified caste? You start with Dravidian parties are bad but are giving examples of citizens. While GOI records show Tamil Nadu consistently has topped in all major metrics (education/health/GDP) > I have run and won the race so I have seen the things up close. Lol. Imagine saying \"saw things up close\" by simply attending a college. > \"doesn't exist in your imaginary world guy\" is still eating a pizza Sounds exactly like you. Unfortunately its true Nah, too much limelight. > you never showed that it doesn't. You said there are atrocities on people who are not in the lower class either. Caste != class. The atrocities were performed on members of the lower castes, despite being economically well off. Just because this reflects unfavorably on your argument doesn't mean it is unrelated. > A low caste IIT graduate with a job is ahead of a high caste auto driver in the socioeconomic scale. Refer Kuppuswamy scale and how it is calculated if you have t heard of it. Kuppuswamy scale was made in 1978 and didn't even take caste into consideration. But anyway, the fact that atrocities continue despite economic upliftment is proof enough that it is not social upliftment. > Follow your own advice. I have. Now you follow it. Ah, the final weapon of destruction when all brain cells give up. Insults. Good, I didn't expect any more. It is not just on the basis of caste, but a human treating another human this badly based on societal dynamics. From the guy that went: > knowing some delusional people have his back. Well, your logic does hold up. You resorted to insults, so you have run out of brain cells. The real tragedy occurs when Christians and Muslims start practicing their own versions of the caste system, it‚Äôs indeed a cultural problem What did the \"limelight\" achieve for the bilkis bano rapists? Hey, I'm another videshi gora with some questions about caste. I've spent over a year visiting India, but in that time I have always shied away from asking about the issue because when I have asked, it has always seemed to make people uncomfortable. So I've generally remained quiet out of a desire to be respectful and polite and not make waves. Anyway, this might be my chance to blurt out my potentially blunt queries. I don't mean to be rude. It's just that caste is a part of Indian culture that is largely invisible to foreigners like me. I know that a person's caste is often obvious to locals by surname. But not always?? I don't understand how surnames may or may not indicate caste. I also find myself wondering how people know about one another's caste when at the end of the day caste is a social construct. By that, I mean caste is not obvious in the material presence of a person, but something which is signified by social means. So, other than surnames, can anyone give me some examples of what those social means are? I have had interactions where I have been painfully shown someone's thread. (Yawn.) Are there other ways that people commonly use to display OR hide their caste? Jobs? Linguistic habits? Clothing? Prohibitions? Other specific displays? Do people ask probing questions to discover another's caste when it's not obvious? Explicitly? Subtly? On paper?! How do people know other people's caste *at all*? Many, many years ago when I was still barely an adult, I stayed on the property of a \"high\" caste individual who kept me segregated from his personal domicile. At some point, I realized I was excluded from his pure space because I was a foreigner and my presence would pollute his personal space. (I was invited into his premises once, and thereafter they were cleaned.) I don't know how to say this, but he was NEVER deliberately rude or unfriendly to me and was ALWAYS absolutely kind to me .... But fuck that. üòÅ It's a type of prejudice we can ALL do without. üë™ >But anyway, the fact that atrocities continue despite economic upliftment is proof enough that it is not social upliftment. But most caste based atrocities are towards the people who are not economically uplifted, right? Social upliftment is not just economic upliftment, but it is a major part. . >this reflects unfavorably on your argument But I am not saying it is unrelated because it doesn't support my argument. I'm saying it's unrelated because it is. If you could only see one comment before it. 1 comment, nothing more, hope your brain cells can do it right. You will find someone implying someone else is blind. Can you find who started such attacks? Hope you do. It is true and criminal has been arrested What are the next three on the list? > But most caste based atrocities are towards the people who are not economically uplifted, right? Social upliftment is not just economic upliftment, but it is a major part. . Nobody denied they're interlinked. The atrocities are the reason they're economically disadvantaged as well. But they aren't the same either, as evidenced by the atrocities carried out on the ones economically well off. > But I am not saying it is unrelated because it doesn't support my argument. I'm saying it's unrelated because it is. You can pretend all you want, doesn't make it unrelated. If atrocities are happening regardless of economic status, then waffling about economic status does nothing. End of story. I didnt enjoy them in school. But people change. So did I. I love reading books now. I have 40+ books which I have already finished. But I dont like those because it reminds me of the school syllabus which I always hated. Edit: also, personal failing? Im entitled to not like something because of my personal experiences with it. It is true. And caste system is still very prevalent in India. Personal example: I married a Bramhin girl (highest caste) and I belong to lower caste, so whenever my in laws visit us (hardly for a day) they pack their own food and refuse to eat anything made in my house even though I am financially doing better than them. I hate this but my wife is happy whenever they visit so I ignore‚Ä¶ > Can you find who started such attacks? Hope you do. [You mean this whining?](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/14srjk9/not_from_india_but_i_need_to_know_if_this_is_true/jqzirxn/?context=3) The one where the supposedly \"deserving\" genius brain of yours thinks reservations are the problem instead of the stupid worship of halo institutions causing the pressure in the first place? I guess this would be too hard for you to grasp because it didn't happen just 1 comment ago. Exactly. Making us mug up something is basically forcing us to read it so that we can pass school. That left a bitter taste in my mouth in respect to these literary works. I just don‚Äôt enjoy them anymore. A parallel: A lot of people stop eating a particular food item if they have a particularly bad experience with it. You can say thats my experience with these books. Impressive how you can be so foolish even with education, I am generally an optimist about human potential but you are making me rethink my world view It is true and person has been imprisoned Cuz you even lost your subtleness and gave in to direct attacks. Literally, no brain cells are needed for those. Me saying great-great grandparent with a broken leg wasn't a big point I was making. I know the present scenario's bad, but I don't think the solution implemented is wise. You made a stupid strawman comparing college entrance exams to races from the very beginning so I had to resort to a similar level of wordplay. Some students who don't deserve reservation get it, and some who deserve it don't.. It's never a blanket generalisation that we can make, and some people will try too hard to ignore this. PS: Do check who started attacking. People are quick to ignore all the knowledge they know only from school like maths and geometry and sciences and literature. Even if you were barely paying attention, odds are, you learned a lot from school. And if you were indeed paying attention, you learned quite a lot. Caste-based discrimination remains a prevalent issue in certain regions of India. The government has implemented laws and initiatives to address it, but societal attitudes and beliefs contribute to its persistence. Thats crazy, cause I have a friend who said they know the caste system but don‚Äôt ever pay attention too it. Wondering is some people were raised with the caste system ingrained Mom's brother set a record in his entrance exam in AIIMS. Dad's brother topped his class in what is now Anna University. Brother was in the 99th percentile in his GRE results. I am relatively an underachiever, and I graduated both my undergrad and grad with a 3.8 GPA. Uncles came to the US with $7 in their pockets. Folks who stayed in their old homes in India - especially metros -- made much more by just sitting on their ass. The main privilege we had was the privilege of excellent role models and sacrificing families. ----------------------------------------- Yeah, yeah, tell me how periyar who belonged to a wealthy landlord family was resentful of Brahmins because of oppression. Tribal people in India are considered as ethnic minorities This isn't the case in majority of India Yes, it is! He got arrested . Do you even know how an average student lives in India, what hardships they face and why they think so highly of some institutes? Or maybe you were born too privileged to experience that. You don't need \"genius\" brains, but at least some empathy for those who suffer, not just on one side that fits your narrative but on both. But nah for you, every guy with a XYZ name is a victim who deserves special care, whereas the guy with ZXY name is a rich evil landlord who doesn't deserve a fair chance. Maybe your brain can't process the idea of a grey world. And I don't make stupid generalisations. Nor do I completely change my comments after blundering. Democracy? Or do you want to ensure that only high class Hindus should rule everybody, hold all the important positions, and make rules for everybody? And watch the only video interview of Ambedkar on youtube. Also, check full Ram k naam film on Kunal kamra's channel. A good bit is focused on the effects on lower castes. On video - I don't think the accused in video would know the caste of the victim just by seeing him (nobody wears tags). So considering this the case is about abusive use of power and status (accused is in politics). In other words discrimination in socio-economic That's like saying \"Obama was US president\". They solved racism. It's over. By your logic sexism is also over? Women president and all. funny them people would ironically use the phrase religion of peace for the other religion and flex how our religion is such religion of tolerance; but really not so. If you are a devout hindu from north, what do you follow if not manusmriti? You just don't know you follow it because of the negative connotations during 1940s. If you read a book that plagiarises Mein Kamf, then you read Mein Kamf without knowing. Most of the modern so called \"hinduism\" is derived from it. Manusmriti codified majority of the caste discrimination we see today and that which was prevalent when Manusmriti was made, i.e. during Gupta Golden Age. During Guptas, think of Manusmriti as standardizing a \"Uniform Civil Code\" for whole of North and East India but from the lenses of one culture(Guptas). If you are a devout hindu from north and *claim* to follow older scriptures instead of Manusmriti, then you should consider Ganesh as a malevolent entity because Dantin+Vinayakas were demonised as such before Gupta community gained power. While the explicit outburst as seen in the video is not very common (still far too common to say rare/uncommon), the undercurrents of casteism is nearly omnipresent except in some small enclaves (like some leftist college unions, or some assortment of high ranking private employees). But even those enclaves cannot be generally defined using any socio-economic or political metric. There are plenty of self described leftist who are quite casteist and money/position does not deter quite a few from being casteist. You will regularly see some extreme outbursts of casteism across India without ever experiencing anything but the undercurrent personally. But if you cannot feel the undercurrent, that's almost certainly because you are not looking closely enough. Do not believe anyone saying that this is how majority of upper castes behave and it is commonplace. And similarly, do not believe anyone saying that is rare and most people aren't casteist. Reddit is just a small fraction of the Indian population and this sub especially has a majority who are quite against casteism. It is not reflective of how India actually is. hmm saiman, speaks, desi meme regular. jeeneet teen definitely knows everything about hinduism. You probably mugged up stuff, that's why you can't remember anything. >If you convert from another religion to Hinduism then you won't really have a caste and will be considered under general category. Usually that doesn't help much in India. You will see casteism within Muslims and Christians in India as well, despite their religions having no concept of such discrimination. It‚Äôs true and the government has taken strict action against the persons and destroyed his house Ramnath Kovind and Draupadi Murmu has been absent in an awful lot of these \"ceremonies\" and temples Use double enter to go to a new line, the post is near unreadable Manusmriti is not known to people doesn't mean that the ideals preached by it are less popular. I agree with your argument that most Hindus aren't even aware of it, but most Hindus are terribly aware of caste and use it in how they behave with people from other castes. And that‚Äôs how governments should function? Reservation does work. The representation in socioeconomic positions which are protected by it has gradually become pretty consistent with the population. What doesn't work is the basis by which reservation is granted. It is more of who can burn more buses at this point. I agree with you completely that reservation is just a band aid to stop the bleeding. You need much more to actually cure the wound. I guess it‚Äôs not on caste level but more on the mental condition of the extremely rich or political people, India‚Äôs population is 1.4 billion + , practically it‚Äôs impossible to have 100% destroy discrimination, but such cases if caught on camera, warrants strict actions‚Ä¶ not sure if this guy is identified and punished though but if identified it would definitely be punished Why apply a quick patch to stop the bleeding if it is not helping to re-generate the limb? Do you see the logic now? > Cuz you even lost your subtleness and gave in to direct attacks. Literally, no brain cells are needed for those. Yes, because I‚Äôm fed up of absolute nonsense arguments based out of personal anecdotes. So I just started putting the amount of effort you did into making your arguments. > Me saying great-great grandparent with a broken leg wasn't a big point I was making. Oh really, so whining about supposedly undeserved people getting in because of their caste isn‚Äôt your point? > You made a stupid strawman comparing college entrance exams to races from the very beginning so I had to resort to a similar level of wordplay. I‚Äôm sorry if even simple analogies are too hard for you. > Some students who don't deserve reservation get it, and some who deserve it don't.. It's never a blanket generalisation that we can make, and some people will try too hard to ignore this. By that logic literally no policy in this world is ‚Äúwise‚Äù. Yes, every policy will have some ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù situations. That doesn‚Äôt mean the whole policy is a failure. On top of that your whole idea of ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù vs ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù is based on marks, without even seeing what kind of life the other person has lived, while being content to dismiss them as ‚Äúfatties who don‚Äôt care‚Äù. You know, the exact thing you accuse me of doing, assuming shit without actually knowing anything. > PS: Do check who started attacking. What, the comment saying people who use reservations as an excuse for casteism are bigots? I see nothing wrong with that. > Do you even know how an average student lives in India, what hardships they face and why they think so highly of some institutes? Or maybe you were born too privileged to experience that. For one, do you? Because all you‚Äôve spoken literally comes from the viewpoint of an urban kid from a pretty well to do family, aka among the top 10% of the country. And in such cases failing to get into IIT is nowhere near a life ending failure. Second, what in that comment suggested it‚Äôs the fault of the kids to think highly of the institutes? I‚Äôm literally pointing out that the system is at fault to create halo institutions and then propagating the myth that it‚Äôs either get into those institutes or you‚Äôre a failure. The fault is also in putting the entire budget into pushing for either engineering or medical colleges, without actually diversifying and creating more opportunities to suit more students. There‚Äôs also a problem in designing exams with syllabus which have almost nothing to do with what the institute is actually going to teach in the curriculum. > You don't need \"genius\" brains, but at least some empathy for those who suffer, not just on one side that fits your narrative but on both. But nah for you, every guy with a XYZ name is a victim who deserves special care, whereas the guy with ZXY name is a rich evil landlord who doesn't deserve a fair chance. Maybe your brain can't process the idea of a grey world. Feel free to show where anyone has claimed what you‚Äôre claiming. Out of us both I‚Äôm the only one actually listing out the reasons causing students issues, while you the self-proclaimed know it all can‚Äôt see anything beyond ‚Äúthat SC kid took my seat‚Äù. Let‚Äôs even humor your logic for a moment, and even go a step further and fuck over all the lower caste kids. Let‚Äôs say reservations are completely abandoned overnight, with only JEE marks as the lone criteria. You consider yourself a ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù candidate worthy of JEE, so it should be trivial for you to calculate how much of a difference it would make to percentile needed to get into IIT. Tell me how that difference supposedly will lessen the pressure on the students and prove how it‚Äôs actually reservation causing all the problems. Go on, should be real easy. > And I don't make stupid generalisations. Nor do I completely change my comments after blundering. Assuming someone is a ‚Äúfatty eating pizza‚Äù for using reservations is absolutely a generalisation, especially when using your personal anecdotes to do so. Plus, I thought it‚Äôs a good thing when someone makes a mistake and changes their answer accordingly, not dig down knowing it was wrong. I do know how to use the edit button though, instead of spamming replies. Yep. Absolutely. The quick patch is meant to be quick, and proper action has to be taken. Do YOU see the logic? Only Reservation with no course of action planned won't solve anything. You are not paying attention. The undercurrent exists everywhere. At some places the casteists feel more empowered to act on it more aggressively and in other places they are more passive about it. I have literally given you the source. Go check instead of deflecting. I don't. And I absolutely agree with you in that regard. However, if we get rid of reservation, then we are going even more backward since I don't suppose I will see any action towards the real remedy even then. Priveleged Brahmin ko bura lag gaya It does happen. The person in the video is probably drunk, because no sane person would do this, or even allow it to be filmed. Unfortunately, the chances of him facing justice are minimal, despite the clear evidence of criminal actions. For this particular video, as per the news I have seen, root cause was the guy was drunk and was from the ruling party. So there was a mix of power and intoxication of drinking. And that my friend i believe is the worst enemy of the humanity. May be use a different app which one you are on. I'm on old reddit and the formatting rules are different for bullet points it seems. You used hyphen while old reddit instructs asterix and a gap. Reservation works, is working, will continue to work. There are 2 goals of reservation: 1. Open doors for deserving candidates who would be wronged by systemic prejudices 2. Recompense the downtrodden castes for the injustices meted out to them It's not about merit or equality of opportunity. The whole point of reservation is that even if there was equality of opportunity there would still be bias by the decision makers. So the solution is to force selection. Yes, the first generation of people who get in struggle a lot. They may not be as qualified as the folks who got in through merit. But their upward movement through society results in generational growth. Their kids can stand toe to toe with their \"upper\" caste counterparts on merit and exceed them in every way. So why not remove reservations for the \"creamy layer\"? See #2. The creamy layer has been creamy for less than a century and already you are upset about it. They were in the gutters for MILLENIA. Have a little patience. It's every were, every corner of the country, even in north eastern India. It is True. Basically the government of India Right now is full of shit show. But still people support them on the basis of religion Who told you that the man is from an Upper caste sir ? I think he is of the same level, but richer. I don't intend on belittling your or your family's accomplishments, I'm just saying that you didn't have the added burden of caste discrimination. In this country that usually comes with historical poverty too, and that's a general statistic with exceptions. There are families who work just as hard and they can't afford US flight tickets or higher education or give the GRE. And they won't have uncles who live in the US either. You know what my comment was really rude and I'm sorry. I just find the discourse on school ruining literature extremely eye roll inducing and i left an abrasive comment. I'm glad you found your love for books despite that though! Blur the victims face! Caste related violence happen in India. The reason Indians might get defensive is that most incidents of violence do not have a caste element. But still seen from that angle. This one is an example. It's a dispute about land and the accused is probably a land mafia. He happens to be high caste. He surely treats other high caste people in the same way when he takes over their land. Most of your links are blatant falsehoods. The president wasn't there because of protocol. In the same way the rajasthan incident has been proved to be utter bollocks. They got law on their side. Similar people had been let off during congress rule, mostly muslim fanatics. The Cisco case is blatantly false. Were you living under a rock or intentionally spreading disinformation? Aptly put. Also both men and women have a fucked up sex life so they are even more frustrated. Im glad I could make u rethink your beliefs Its not an issue I am sure the WhatsApp university agrees with you. I agree with what you have to say. But I just want to ask you this- why should I have patience? I did not wrong anyone. I did not harm anyone. I treat everyone equally. Yet you want me to have patience? Brother this system is outdated and needs revision. You are blind to that and want others to pay? I'm not ok with struggling professionals in the workforce. I've seen first hand what happens to a lot the first generation people who get in through reservation into the premier institutes and then struggle till they drop out or kill themselves. I've almost killed myself too so I know how hard it can get. Force selection is not the answer. The answer is education from the primary level that can make the downtrodden capable of growing and taking back what they lost. Reservation was just a temporary measure. It needs more policies to replace it slowly. I mean honestly this system is just a joke now. Groups of people who can agitate and destroy public property hard enough have been getting reservations despite their socio-economic stature. You want me to reduce my aspirations, my dreams because my ancestors were fucking idiots? And it's just in 70 years time 3 generations have been educated, joined the workforce and retired and yet this system has not been able to create awareness about the problem. Do you call this working? Brother if you do I feel sad for you. I want to leave this country for good to never come back because people like you will make people like me wait for the rest of our lives for this country to have the kind of opportunities that are found elsewhere. But I feel pity. Really I feel pity that idiots like you will be running this place. Sure. Even lot of Indians are not aware of the caste based discrimination. And its not because its not there, but we have become less attentive. About govt, they have just used this caste based injustices to milk votes. > Yes, because I‚Äôm fed up of absolute nonsense arguments based out of personal anecdotes. So I just started putting the amount of effort you did into making your arguments. I don't care about you being fed up. You get what you deserve. Hell, you started with a stupid strawman. Don't start making excuses now. > Oh really, so whining about supposedly undeserved people getting in because of their caste isn‚Äôt your point? Oh yes, some undeserved candidates do get *just* because of their caste; that is true in the present scenario. The one about grandfather was just an example in a language that you were using because you were \"fed up\". > I‚Äôm sorry if even simple analogies are too hard for you Said everyone who ever made a strawman. Or do I have to explain how races and competitive exams are different? Reasoning by analogies introduces so many flaws, man that's basic. > By that logic literally no policy in this world is ‚Äúwise‚Äù. Yes, every policy will have some ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù situations. Yes, but the problem is that the current policy doesn't even acknowledge its flaws, it simply ignores them. Neither do reservation defenders. How do you solve a problem when you don't even acknowledge its existence? > without even seeing what kind of life the other person has lived, Isn't that my whole point? You have to know what the person went through before declaring they are a victim. If you just give victim status on the basis of names, you are bound to have a system that fails. And don't accuse me of making generalisations. The \"fatties\" was not a generalisation; never did I say that all reserved candidates were undeserving. When I gave the fatties example, you were just getting a response in the language *you* started with because you were \"fed up\". It was just to let you know that cases like that exist. I don't make stupid generalisations. > urban kid from a pretty well to do family, 10% of the country Lmao, really, I don't know what makes you think that. Maybe I should feel good, dunno. Without revealing too much about me, I think I can tell you that when I got into college, my family income was less than half of the amount required to get a fee subsidy. It still is larger than the vast majority of people in India tho. And also, I come from a village in a state that the majority of people would consider too underdeveloped, even by Indian standards. The fact that you thought I was some 10% earning urban kid shows the biases in your mind. > Out of us both I‚Äôm the only one actually listing out the reasons causing students issues I agree with how messed up the current system is, and I was never against that. I was arguing about why reservation is a bad solution. > system is at fault to create halo institutions and then propagating the myth that it‚Äôs either get into those institutes or you‚Äôre a failure Ya, No matter what you change, people will set high targets for themselves and feel bad if they fail; those who achieve those targets will feel proud of it and thus will make those targets even more desirable for others. It will happen till the end of time. > ‚Äúthat SC kid took my seat‚Äù. Nah, I got mine. > calculate how much of a difference it would make to percentile needed to get into IIT Not a lot, but at least it would make it fair. When the dust settles, and students fail, at least they know that this time only they are to blame, that everyone who gave the exams had tried their best, and the best person won. Yea these exams are hard, doesn't mean that we can create stupid rules to make it even harder for some and child play for some others. What kind of justification is that. > Assuming someone is a ‚Äúfatty eating pizza‚Äù for using reservations is absolutely a generalisation, especially when using your personal anecdotes to do so Again, that was an example in the language *you* started. It was not meant as a generalisation, no matter how many times you repeat it. >mistake and changes their answer accordingly, not dig down knowing it was wrong. I do know how to use the edit button though, instead of spamming replies. Better to acknowledge mistakes before cowardly erasing them from existence. Its true and happened. However I am not sure if it was some cast based discrimination but the case mostly liked to be an act of atrocity towards lower caste person, castism exist its not extinct thing however it is uncommon in public display mostly it is behind the scenes It's true, and upper cast people thinks like that's their right to rule over lower caste people... And that others are born to be slave and work for them... idk i have seen some low minded low thinking low self esteem people talking bad about so called lower castes ... I remember once a kid my age said something bad about lower castes ( from elite family of india).. that shows what their parents might be teaching them... btw never seen something u send .. the link was HORRIBLE.. btw we will try to fix it in our country if its remaining... thanks for criticism.. This is too much and degrading. However this may be an exceptional case. Though the caste system still exist in India, people are more educated and understanding. If a man does it it‚Äôs wrong and if a cow does it‚Äôs right? Dear op, there are few perfectly different perspectives for this scenario. 01. Castism is still real, it's ingrained in the brain of everybody living in this country. It's a cultural phenomenon where you can't make people turn off a culture at some given arbitrary time period, it will take strong strategic social engineering programmes to make it perfectly fade into non-existent. 02. Castism has been here for thousands of years, or at least hundreds, so those who suffered its ill effects as victims are still dragging them even in the current generation. So the government has to offer positive affirmative actions to help them get equal opportunities like those who have benefited. These are done to increase the representation of the community, these are don because of the constitution offers these options. So no easy job, and will take time and patience. And what is that cure in your words? Yo I am from a \"Higher\" caste and I definitely assure you we don't piss on \"lower\" caste people. It's not something that anybody does for that matter... That might just be a drunkard which is very common in India... The only \"ill\" treatment that someone from a higher caste might do to a lower caste person is treat them as \"unclean\" of some sorts which is bad in itself but this isn't something that we do... Don't believe these other comments tho It is sadly True. > I don't care about you being fed up. You get what you deserve. Hell, you started with a stupid strawman. Don't start making excuses now. You calling it a strawman doesn‚Äôt make it so. You were the one that whined about irrelevant nonsense to start with, so you can stuff your excuses. > Oh yes, some undeserved candidates do get just because of their caste; that is true in the present scenario. And who decides that, you? > The one about grandfather was just an example in a language that you were using because you were \"fed up\". As if reservation whiners don‚Äôt bring up the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be punished for sins of ancestors‚Äù incessantly regardless of ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù. > Said everyone who ever made a strawman. So says someone who doesn‚Äôt know what a strawman is. > Or do I have to explain how races and competitive exams are different? Now *that‚Äôs* a strawman. Nobody claimed races and competitive exams are the same thing. Although they‚Äôre going to have more in common than you think. > Reasoning by analogies introduces so many flaws, man that's basic. Given proper reasoning doesn‚Äôt seem to go through you, oversimplifying becomes necessary. But looks like you can‚Äôt handle that either. > Yes, but the problem is that the current policy doesn't even acknowledge its flaws, it simply ignores them. Neither do reservation defenders. Another strawman. > How do you solve a problem when you don't even acknowledge its existence? Just because a problem ‚Äúexists‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs automatically important enough to solve immediately. > Isn't that my whole point? You have to know what the person went through before declaring they are a victim. If you just give victim status on the basis of names, you are bound to have a system that fails. Policy isn‚Äôt created per person. It‚Äôs made based on statistics. It is known casteism is a widespread problem and that measures are need to equalise issues caused by it. Only those who think it doesn‚Äôt exist think it is possible to address it on a case-by-case basis. Sure, politicians aren‚Äôt doing anything to resolve the system in the first place, but that‚Äôs not an issue of reservation, other than upper castes seething about lower castes getting to stand on the same stage as them. > And don't accuse me of making generalisations. The \"fatties\" was not a generalisation; never did I say that all reserved candidates were undeserving. Your visions of ‚Äúundeserved‚Äù are vague enough to include most. > When I gave the fatties example, you were just getting a response in the language you started with because you were \"fed up\". It was just to let you know that cases like that exist. Lmao, don‚Äôt blame me for your crass language. You‚Äôre the one that came in claiming only those who don‚Äôt pass competitive exams defend reservations. You came into the thread willingly, so don‚Äôt cry when taking your own medicine. And as for ‚Äúexisting‚Äù, plenty of things ‚Äúexist‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs automatically a problem. Bring the numbers if you think it‚Äôs such a terrible problem. > I don't make stupid generalisations. So you claim, while making stupid generalisations. > I agree with how messed up the current system is, and I was never against that. I was arguing about why reservation is a bad solution. The only bad thing you‚Äôve pointed out so far is ‚Äúsome kid I decided is undeserving got a seat and that hurts my feefees‚Äù. > Ya, No matter what you change, people will set high targets for themselves and feel bad if they fail; those who achieve those targets will feel proud of it and thus will make those targets even more desirable for others. It will happen till the end of time. > Not a lot, but at least it would make it fair. When the dust settles, and students fail, at least they know that this time only they are to blame, that everyone who gave the exams had tried their best, and the best person won. Fucking lol. Now all the ‚Äúempathy‚Äù and ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù for those poor students vanished into thin air. As long as there is no reservation, no problem with students under immense pressure jumping and committing suicide I guess. Just don‚Äôt have any pesky low caste in IITs, that‚Äôs the main thing. The mask always falls off sooner or later. > Again, that was an example in the language you started. I didn‚Äôt generalise like you, so don‚Äôt blame me for your nonsense. Your claims are based on nothing, regardless of ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù, and in the end you just outed yourself as another casteist loser. I guess that‚Äôs why the comment calling out bigots came of as an attack for you. > Better to acknowledge mistakes before cowardly erasing them from existence. Good to know you‚Äôre so intently following me that you could track edits in a couple minutes timeframe. It was a rhetorical question. At this point, I‚Äôm not really surprised you had trouble picking it up. Anyways, Telangana, UP and Kerala are the next three on the list. How come your do-no-wrong southern states are so high on the list? News Alert. There are people other than high class Hindus who come under the general category :) Not OP but economic and primary education based reservation. The reservation policy required revision. There is no doubt in that. It's all relative, I believe. Compared to a 'low caste' Hindu, everybody else is a high class Hindu. Don't think there is a medium class Hindu as a category. Madhya pardesh government and CM already taken strict action on culprit. No. Lodi media agrees with you. You know who pointed out rajasthan case is false? The print. Why keep up this imbecility? And I would suggest you to search related news from the print. The case was false and the company is suing back. And I would suggest you to search related news from the print. The case was false and the company is suing back. The world is full of stupid people; noone can deny that! Why are you lying so much? Shouldn't you be ashamed of yourself? this is true in some villages of india where the public is orthodox, but i hv never seen discrimination in urban areas of india. in mumbai, there is no discrimination as such except for some migrated people here. yup that is true, infact that is a elected rep of the current ruling party in the national level, and there are videos and instances far more disturbing that this, please search \"hathras case\", and also do look up what happened proceeding it. Certainly agree that Dr. Ambedkar‚Äôs life and works should be taught in schools. However, just because Dr. Ambedkar attributed the caste system to Manusmriti, it does not mean it should be rejected or that is is indeed all BS. Ambedkar said a lot about Muslims too, so should we kill all or wot? Yeah like the people weren't forced to convert or die by the Muslim rulers. It is true, in the sense that very severe forms of caste based abuse, like the one depicted in the video exists in India. It is also true, that the extent of such discrimination and abuse varies greatly across regions and across the rural vs urban divide, and has been progressively declining in most parts of India. And yet it still exists and that's shameful. Yeah let‚Äôs inject caste into this instead of treating this as a crime. Recently there were 2 incidents of drunk passengers in business class seats in Air India peeing on fellow passengers. Is that caste based also? Stop politicizing such incidents and focus on how to catch and punish the criminal. ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ô‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßÄ‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡ßü‡ßã‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡ßá ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶ø‡•§ ‡¶∏‡¶ø‡¶™‡¶ø‡¶è‡¶Æ ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶®, ‡¶è‡¶∏‡¶¨ ‡¶§‡ßã ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶∂ ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶≤ ‡¶•‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶ö‡¶≤‡¶õ‡ßá‡•§ from one's family name, usually. For inter caste marriages, caste is inherited from the father, although intercaste marriages are still rare in India. The institution of arranged marriage plays a big part in maintaining caste endogamy. Okay let me give you full explanation. Does caste based discrimination exists? Yes. But are these type of incidents common? No. There's a very strict law against this discrimination and that too is non bailable. Once there's complain against you, you're fucked. Is these worse than murdering someone? No. Murders stil happen. This is a rarest of rare case. All discrimination I have seen in my life is that people marry in the same caste only. Buts it's their choice no? Inter caste marriages happen too. Main problem is lack of education and modernisation, that's why it's more prevalent in rural areas. Also in no core texts of Hinduism, caste system is mentioned. No stories of God's have propagated this caste based discrimination. It was invented by society itself. Unlike other religions where in the core text books it's written to behead and kill those who do not believe in their religion. (Holy book 9:5 for context) Christianity has probably more killings than any other religion in the name of religion, however the close second is not far behind. Atleast with modernisation and education Christianity and Hindu social evils are diminishing. I am more worried about the other, whose engineer and professors are planning suicide attacks. Also didn't know reddit is full Indian fake liberal pussies. Don't worry with the downvotes bruv. All you are speaking is nothing but facts. It's probably general caste ppl being pissed off about reservation seats üòÇ PS (I'm a general) We are as shocked as you are It‚Äôs true, I from the place this incident took place It is true and the person who did this claims to be an active participant or worker of the ruling party, so you can understand what government is doing.. Yeah it's true and casteism still exist and practiced openly. It is practiced by our government giving reservation to lower castes. It is also practiced in family where upper castes are not allowed to marry lower castes. Yes , unfortunately it is Padharo mhare desh :) Yes it was a truly disturbing video. The concerned person has been arrested.And won't be out anytime soon. Further as an act of consolidation the CM of the state has gone ahead and washed the poor man's feet. ( Wonder what will achieve? ) Nevertheless, this is shocking, and despite the saffrons tomotoming, India still has a long way for equality. Yes it is true but it individual behavior not general. Such sporadic events of different nature happen everywhere all the time but one can't draw any generalized conclusions about any country or community from such individuals behavior. Yes it is I can't say that I have seen or experienced this because I am a brahmin though I do have one sc friend and he is like a brother I could never imagine doing something like this to him Yes it is true, the video is from Sidhi a place in Madhya Pradesh, the guy urinating on the man his name is pravesh Shukla (allegedly associated with bjp, not confirmed yet) and the other person is a tribal labour, after the video of the incident got viral chief minister Shivraj Singh chauhan ordered to take strict action against pravesh and shivraj invited the tribal man to the CM office in bhopal, he apologized to the man and washed his feet(a sign of respect in Hinduism). Govt action : [https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2023/07/06/watch-mp-chief-minister-chouhan-washes-feet-of-urination-incident-victim.html](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2023/07/06/watch-mp-chief-minister-chouhan-washes-feet-of-urination-incident-victim.html) Hi OP. First of all, I am sorry that you got to see this cheap stunt from India. Definitely there's a lot of casteism in India considering the history we have. Politicians are definitely making it about upper and lower caste, the man who peed also might had the same intention, which I don't support. But it's much more than that. It's about humanity, being an Indian, I look at this incident as an act of illeteracy and no braniner. Even if you follow the caste system, have some decency in life. If the accused considers himself as a man from upper caste and is so much proud about it, then at least show that in your behaviour. Why would you pee on someone? Unfortunately, politics is different, opposition makes a fuss about it and ruling party uses the tribal man by washing is hands and feet. But what about that tribal man? He has suffered a lot. He got peed on himself, FUCK!! So such people needs to be punished in such a way that others get scared of even thinking about such acts. Government is simply playing with people's emotions, in this politics the common man gets hurt the most. Definitely, we Indians don't allow such act and being a developing country we Indians are trying to make India a better place to live. Its true But we don‚Äôt need outsiders to teach us about caste system Europeans were racists for years and I saw a video where a Canadian citizen was being a racist So instead of asking about India contemplate and check your own country‚Äôs status Exactly europeans use racism they used for hundreds of years on everyone and now they want to teach us ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è > Anyways, Telangana, UP and Kerala are the next three on the list. They are not. Hahaha nice try, go again. Which country are you from ,what's the ethic composition of your country? It is true but asking the government for cure is non sensical eg u can punish people who do it but what about others. So, u need civil society movement to dislike or remove people who condone discrimination. Tbh the dude urinated cos he was drunk. Not because of this caste issue. Both of them looked bomb ass drunk. Ambedkar is not the constitution. Ambedkar was one (jaded) man. The situation right now is nothing like what he envisaged. Even he would be disgusted by the misuse of reservations and his name by certain members of his own community. Let's honor him by revamping reservations completely. If a building has 2 lifts its a given. Seen so many meltdowns (my family included) when raises in salary are requested by domestic workers / dhobi's / guards. The very same people don't bat an eyelid dropping 10k on a family meal. Ambedkar is the reason the Constitution has protections regarding lower castes in the first place. And no, he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù regarding the complete non-attempts made to resolve casteism, instead people just whining about reservations to avoid addressing their own failures. The absolute gall to think the situation ‚Äúis nothing like‚Äù what he foresaw, fucking lol. Oh, you mean Ambedkar wanted certain members from the reserved castes to abuse government given benefits while nothing is actually done to tackle the caste problem plaguing the country? Do you really think he was that bad? Upper castes throwing measures taken to equalise millennia of oppression under the bus with the pathetic excuse of ‚Äúsomeone abused it‚Äù is indeed something he foresaw. Hell, it wasn‚Äôt even foresight, people like you whined and moaned the moment it was suggested. Ah yes, refuse to even acknowledge the problem. Only those who actively benefit from such an abuse can make such gaslighting comments. Oh, acknowledging the problem? Fine then, bring the numbers, show how it is such an immediate urgent problem. My family is very well off, and even then I've been discriminated against by Brahmins much poorer than me. But you tend to not care too much if you have money. We just make fun of them and move on. The younger urban population seems to not care about caste, so I'm kind of hopeful for the future. The entire Indian society is raised with caste system ingrianed. Like British society is raised with the class system and Americans are raised with racial hegemonies ingrained. If your friend doesn't pay attention to it, they are either upper caste or rich. I'm not UC, but my family is wealthy so I didn't even know my caste for a long time. If you're poor+low caste+from a village is when you get the shit lottery. There's a saying in India, \"If you don't know your caste, you're upper caste\". Because if you're lower, you simply can't go through life here without paying attention to it. What kind of numbers do you want?

Do you admit that not all reserved classes are equal? Are there still certain members of the society who have no access to reservations and who desperately need them? Do you think economic criteria would be a much better indicator of oppression as opposed to caste? A casteist mentality is still present at the back of the heads of people including my father's generation as they were very much taught to imbibe those qualities of hatred from their own parents. And all the urbanisation yet something that you've been taught right from your birth is a bit hard to go by and sometimes pops here and there in tinier acts of his. However, I do believe that it is very much on the decline and people from my generation are openly trying to voice against it and I myself have called out my own dad on something seemingly innocent to him but born of racism. &#x200B; As for what the government is doing. They're also taking some steps against it. Here, the victim is Dashmat Rawat, a tribal labour and the assailant is a man who goes by the name of Pravesh Shukla. The incident happened in a state of ours called Madhya Pradesh which actually has a significant tribal population in certain regions. Once, the incident came to light, the Chief Minister of the state, invited Rawat to his residence in the state capital and publically washed his feet with his own hands. The Chief Minister said, and I quote, ‚ÄúSaddened by this incident. I apologise to you. People like you are like God to me. Accused Pravesh Shukla will be punished in a way that becomes an example for others. If needed, we will bury the criminals in the ground.‚Äù The accused Pravesh was subsequently arrested and on the Chief Minister's orders will be tried under the stringent National Security Act and to further set an example, properties belonging to the accused were bulldozed across the state. The local police further detained two more men who were responsible for shooting the video and not intervening when they should have.

Nobody says the laws are perfect either, so you can stop your stupid strawmanning as well.

Do you think people are going to piss on that autowala like that person did on the ST guy? Or another way, just how many upper castes are sanitation workers? The guy pissing had his property demolished, most leftist people won't talk about this here. Kaafi educated A poor autowallah would not be in the position of Rohit Vemula, lol. You think a poor autowallah would have the time and money to form an association? You think a poor autowallah would have the audacity to assault and ABVP leader? Poor autowallahs struggle with poverty everyday. They don't commit suicide because they were suspended from their university. And fuck it, even those poor autowallahs are in a much, much better economic position than the daily wage labourers. India has pockets of crippling poverty which we are doing nothing to alleviate, all because the poor Rohit Vemulas of the world take the benefit of reservations but don't actually utilize it correctly. Fucking lol. Of course now you‚Äôll start spouting whatsapp forwards to protect your stupid claims. So forming an association means it is okay to perform atrocities? Typical of bigots. > Poor autowallahs struggle with poverty everyday. Yes, poverty was the main thing lower castes had to live with for millennia, right? EDIT: Fucking lol, casteist loser blocked me because he stopped getting answers and ran away with a pathetic ‚Äúno u‚Äù. I‚Äôm going to take this as an admission that you think it‚Äôs okay to commit atrocities on lower castes if they act uppity, bigot. I suggest YOU stop relying on whatsapp forwards and start living in the real world. Caste politics and division in the country is carrying forward from the British era divide and conquer policies.

Bravo. Unlike you I have empathy for both sides and I don't have black and white vision. It amazes me how you can completely ignore a side you don't care about. And when that's the case, what can I even expect from someone like you. (generalisations maybe) Victim privileges are addictive and once you gets a taste of it its hard to let go. Maybe understanding the complexities of a situation is too hard for your smooth brain. Maybe the simplest and dumbest solution is all you can come up with and be proud of. Stupid rules like these are exploited by idiots like you. You don't even have the capability of acknowledging the problems you don't care about. If you had some ground experience, maybe you would have gained some empathy.

Hi OP, since we are now picking headlines of one-off incidents to make sweeping assumptions about countries we have no idea about, let me ask you this I am not from Scotland (seems like you are).. Is it true that Scots are the most racist people on earth? We Indians are passionate about cricket and it distresses us deeply that the evil of White Anglo Saxon racism is being brought into sport, specifically our beloved cricket.. are these attitudes widely prevalent in Scottish society in this day and age? Why is this happening inspite of advancement of human rights and the presence of enlightened souls like you who hunt for upsetting news headlines in other countries? I am no messiah and also not a socio-political thinker who has the data required to devise such a cure. The government hasn't even done a caste census for decades so nobody has any factual information. Therefore, I just have some theories. 1. Encourage people to freely choose surnames while registering birth. Yes, it is available already but most don't even have an idea that it is doable. Better yet, identify caste based surnames and abolish their usage in official documents. 2. Encourage inter-caste marriages by removing unnecessary protocols about declaring intention of marriage months prior. Make the process fast, easy, and accessible to register marriages under the Special Marriage Act. 3. Stop the police from harassing the inter-caste or inter-religious couples once the couple states their wish to marry in a police station or court and force the police to provide them protection. Stop registering third party complaints in the case of marriages (only the families of the couples should be allowed to register FIRs if they suspect ill intentions and those should only be acted upon if the couple themselves fail to testify their intentions in front of the police or the court). 4. Invest in quality subsidised education in regions with higher population from the reserved categories and teach them in their mother tongue wherever possible. Make laws and govt circulars available in the vernacular of all groups of people in every state. This is required to ensure social mobility. 6. Do a caste census and only award reservation to the various backward groups in positions where there is a serious issue of representation. No reservation for the dominant castes in any region. While it was initially necessary for reservation to be a political move, it is high time to decouple it from politics and make it data oriented. This is rather controversial but I see no other way to stop the random agitations demanding reservations without any basis in recorded facts. This way if representation is fixed, reservation can be taken away from that position for the particular group. There is a single assumption behind these measures: Each sufficiently large group of people is equally meritorious (on average) and thus if the socio-economic classes were truly merit based, they would have equal (with some random deviations as is the nature of all statistical data) representation throughout. > You can surely read them once again to check they are generalisations or not. Maybe it takes you some time to understand your own words properly. Sure I did, that‚Äôs why I told you not throw around the word randomly. Ah well, what else can you expect from someone who thinks strawman means analogy. > Another dumb oversimplification from your smooth brain which shows how you can't grasps complexities of the situation and have imaginary idealistic solutions which can't be brought into practice. Oh don‚Äôt hide behind useless platitudes. Even under the ‚Äúideal‚Äù scenario of completely scrapping reservations the percentile doesn‚Äôt budge, meaning the load on students doesn‚Äôt decrease. This is pure statistics, something ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù students should be easily able to calculate. The fact that you can‚Äôt calculate it and think ‚Äúoh no reserved seats hence twice as easier‚Äù shows how sorely lacking you are in terms of ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù, and you want to judge others for being ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù. Fucking lol. > On the other hand, simpler unfair practices are fine for you. Good going idiot. Yes, in the real world people focus on problems that when solved will actually make a difference, not whine about stuff that doesn‚Äôt make a difference, maybe other than ‚Äúmy feelings hurt that SC kid got a seat‚Äù. Maybe in your delusional world people focus on insignificant problems. > That was to point out that you lack acknowledgement, but its just wooooosh for you. This doesn‚Äôt even mean anything. As far as I‚Äôm concerned there‚Äôs no difference between me editing a comment before hitting save and editing a couple seconds after hitting save. You needing to make up problems to attack me on is your issue, not mine. Yes it exists in every sphere. Caste markers are visible everywhere but people choose not to see it or claim that it doesn't exist anymore. This is pure, unadulterated bs. Govt does nothing because pleasing UCs = money = votes. Caste is too deep-rooted and the current regime does nothing substantial to end it or put an end to discrimination itself. UCs go on and on about how affirmative action is \"unfair\" completely oblivious to the fact that this is the only thing that's helping DBAs. It's a cesspool and you should be glad you're not here Caste based system is still there, I belong to a very very rural place in Barmer, Rajasthan. I‚Äôm not a active resident and visit there couple of times in a year. I have studied in a very good education system that keeps me from any caste based thinking but I am a science person and I have my own problem to solve, so I don‚Äôt rebel in my village and let them be how they want to be. I‚Äôm explaining what happens there, not what I believe in. I have lived with people from different backgrounds without asking them their caste. But when I‚Äôm in my village I have to behave according to the culture and traditions there. The people from other caste‚Äôs when they visit my home will be treated differently based on their caste. I‚Äôm giving some examples here that will give you enough insight. 1. Meghval, Bheel caste or Muslims or any other caste which is considered lower - They are our neighbours and they mostly visit our house for day labour. We don‚Äôt shake hands with them but we do greet them with a big smile. When serving them tea, drinks or food, we have separate utensils for them that are kept in bags, Meghvals and Bheels have different bags utensils and Muslims have different. They can enter our house but only to the mens sitting area. That too they will enter to a limit, there will be a shed in not too inside and not too outside area where we will offer them a clean sheet to sit. We don‚Äôt ask any visitor the purpose of visit, whatever the caste maybe, without offering them water and a place to sit. If the visit is long enough to make tea, then we will offer tea. Very Important point here - From my observation I have found that, there is no caste lower than us which is pure vegetarian(cattle milk but no eggs). So this utensils thing is purely based on that. But people from higher caste if they are non vegetarian, we have to treat them as equals because from old times they were considered as bad people, they used to kill lower caste people like us if they find anything disrespectful. 2. Lower caste from different state, or some government official - Here the village mind can‚Äôt process what to do and they forget caste discrimination and they are treated them like equals. But some senior officials who have seen discrimination in their times would themselves ask us not to serve in our utensils and then they will get the bag of separate utensils. 3. Equal or higher caste but assumed to be a non vegetarian person - People from my caste don‚Äôt like visits from them because they have to offer their own utensils and they dislike it. Sometimes keeping the serving dishes aside to be properly washed outside the house. 4. In my Gurus house - my guru who is trained by other guru‚Äôs from my region, doesn‚Äôt believe in caste system and inside his premises there is no discrimination based on it. BUT TIMES ARE CHANGING - What i have explained above is changing and will last no more 2 generations if the elders don‚Äôt force their thinking onto the younger ones. What if someone doesn‚Äôt discriminate others based on caste - If the news gets out, other people, relatives etc will warn you and if the same continues then they will remove your family from samaaj(idk what its called, community?) and no one from your samaaj will be allowed to visit your house and you will also be banned to visit them. There are more factors in play here. If you are married in your community then your father in law will be actively pushing you not be a rebel if he believes in caste system. So the pressure builds up and most people don‚Äôt do this. There is a lot more i could write, but you can ask me anything and I‚Äôll respond. > Sure I did Then it's officially time for school. > Even under the ‚Äúideal‚Äù scenario of completely scrapping reservations the percentile doesn‚Äôt budge, meaning the load on students doesn‚Äôt decrease. But the game becomes fair, and that makes a lot of difference. Again, its stupid to think it's fine to make a hard scenario harder just because it's already hard. Anyone who was ever serious about JEE knows that the vast majority of students who give JEE don't seriously prepare for it and are out of competition from the first day itself. Only 100k-200k (a lot less for JEE advanced) compete seriously for those 50k seats. So yea when half seats are reserved it makes a huge difference in the difficulty and removing it would benefit many, so don't go crying that \"but it won't make any difference vroo\" > twice as easier I expected that you would stupidly take *twice* in a literal way. > Yes, in the real world people focus on problems that when solved will actually make a difference Don't say the problems of so many students doesn't matter, just say it doesn't matter *to you.* And the politicians who just care about vote banks. > Maybe in your delusional world people focus on insignificant problems. Expected from \"privileged fatties\" like you. The problems you don't care about are insignificant. > This doesn‚Äôt even mean anything. Of course woooosh for you. > As far as I‚Äôm concerned there‚Äôs no difference between me editing a comment before hitting save and editing a couple seconds after hitting save. Say stupid stuff and cowardly erase it from existence on realising it was all foolish. It confirmed that privileged fatties like you can't accept that people other than your precious victims can face problems. \"oh but that guy is Sharma, he must be a billionaire, oh that guy is of lower caste, he must be a poor street cleaner\". Keep believing that names tell the full story. Hold your delusion, good for smooth-brained fatties. This shit happens primarily in North India. Very rare chance of this happening in South India. Yes casteism is still prelevent and it's at a point where powerful, influential or rich low caste people hate high caste ( obviously) and try to intimidate them. There are rules which intimidates some middle class people to deal with lower caste in business and such. However in rural areas high caste are still oppressing low caste people. Taking advantage of them and make them feel that they deserve this. Reservation similar to affirmative action is trying to make it better. It's been 75 odd years and it's still happening. Imo urban areas are getting better but rural ( which is the larger portion) lot of issues are still there. > Then it's officially time for school. Yep, go back to school. You desperately need it. > But the game becomes fair, and that makes a lot of difference. No it doesn‚Äôt, outside of losers who can only see ‚Äúsc kid taking seats‚Äù. The pressure doesn‚Äôt come from reservations. > Again, its stupid to think it's fine to make a hard scenario harder just because it's already hard. Anyone who was ever serious about JEE knows that the vast majority of students who give JEE don't seriously prepare for it and are out of competition from the first day itself. Only 100k-200k (a lot less for JEE advanced) compete seriously for those 50k seats. So yea when half seats are reserved it makes a huge difference in the difficulty and removing it would benefit many, so don't go crying that \"but it won't make any difference vroo\" ü§£ü§£ü§£ So now most students ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù. Please, keep making excuses to justify your pathetic assumptions and extreme inability to do calculations. > I expected that you would stupidly take twice in a literal way. Aw silly me, expecting proper ability to calculate effect of something from a ‚Äúdeserving meritdhaari‚Äù. Of course I should just expect random numbers thrown out with no substance from ‚Äúdeserving meritdhaari‚Äù like you. > Don't say the problems of so many students doesn't matter, just say it doesn't matter to you. And the politicians who just care about vote banks. > Expected from \"privileged fatties\" like you. The problems you don't care about are insignificant. No, ‚Äúproblems‚Äù that are just ‚Äúmy feelings hurt because sc kid got seat‚Äù, and whose ‚Äúsolution‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change shit are insignificant. And *that* is called a strawman. Thanks for a proper demonstration. > It confirmed that privileged fatties like you can't accept that people other than your precious victims can face problems. Oh, I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs such an extreme problem for bigots to have low caste people studying alongside them. Truly, a fate worse than death. >No it doesn‚Äôt, outside of losers who can only see ‚Äúsc kid taking seats‚Äù Oh yea, the guy the one who got a worse seat due to a reservation must be the loser. Shiny brain you have. >So now most students ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù. Please, keep making excuses to justify your pathetic assumptions and extreme inability to do calculations. Lmaoo you didn't even know this much, and you are rambling on this topic. What a stupid loser you are. Such a huge disconnect with what goes on the ground and you speak as if you know about this stuff. You just proved I was so right. Not having any ground experience results in a huge disconnect from reality. What a fool lol. >Of course I should just expect random numbers Again what a fool to think those are random numbers. Literally, the first thing you are told when you start preparing for JEE is not to get intimidated by the huge number of applicants because the actual students in competition are far lower. Everyone who has given these exams knows this. I hope you don't actually think that a million students are studying day and night for JEEs, what a joke. >I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs such an extreme problem for bigots to have low caste people studying alongside them. Typical reservation defender who thinks that higher caste people have a problem with lower caste people studying alongside them whereas students can't care less about the identity guy sitting next to them. Again you go on to show why having a some experience on the field matters. What can we expect form some privileged fatty rambling on a topic he doesn't know shit about. Lol you don't even know these tiny little things and are arguing here. Typical. Hmm interesting, idk I know her father became a monk. And she kind of is an artist and went through art school But I only know she was working for Amazon at one point and was trying to find a way to the US but couldn‚Äôt and asked for my help and then she found another job and travels sometimes in India. So I‚Äôm guessing she pretty much is. That‚Äôs why I view societies and it‚Äôs not just perspective thing it‚Äôs actually quite crazy that we have these massive societies. And that there‚Äôs a caste system a system like that should not exist. A hiearchy should never be present unless it‚Äôs a leader. Who‚Äôs a true leader who can lead people into another stage that the people can‚Äôt do it without and the leader is fearless to lead people into an uncomfortable bit beneficial society. A leader that grows and develops theirself is what I‚Äôm essentially trying to say. Otherwise, families and people should decide for themselves and share food. Now becoming rich and the accessibility to that wealth especially now with this technology is actually awesome but very very competitive I might add. That‚Äôs why I think what‚Äôs the point of a hiearchal societal land where humans live in such close proximity is pointless in some ways. Most probably, this was all a political stunt by existing state government. He followed all steps. Bulldozed perpetrators house as a proxy of immediate justice. Washed feet of victim. All done. Now to next marketing campaigns before upcoming state election. > Lmaoo you didn't even know this much, and you are rambling on this topic. What a stupid loser you are.

So your ‚Äúexperience‚Äù on the matter is‚Ä¶ what the coaching centre people fed you to keep you there. Great. If this is the type of people getting into IIT, no wonder our research output is down in the dumps. For your kind information the ‚Äúseriousness‚Äù is simply inferred through the bell curve, and plenty of those who commit suicide under pressure also fall into the ‚Äúnon-serious‚Äù category simply because they can‚Äôt cope with the syllabus. And the amount of casteism that goes in campuses also debunks your ‚ÄúnO sTudeNts cAre‚Äù bullshit drivel. No matter, I have no reason to continue this charade with someone who doesn‚Äôt even know how to calculate basic statistics, doesn‚Äôt know how to question whatever the coaching centre folks fed him, and thinks casteism doesn‚Äôt exist because his blind ass didn‚Äôt see it. Privileged fatty indeed, thinking his tiny sheltered world is ‚Äúexperience on the field‚Äù, and then having the gall to use student suicides and their causes as an excuse for his casteism. This isn't really related to lower or higher caste as much as I know(I live in MP where it happened). The guy was drunk and the poor man had some disability or something like that. Also the poor guy was from a tribal background. Depending on the state in rural India, yes. In larger cities, theres almost no chance you'll witness something like this happening. And yeah that man's house has been bulldozed and he has been arrested. the tribal has been provided a compensation of around 5 lakh rupees (6000 dollars as of now). Lol I just made it up >the coaching centre people fed you to keep you there Of course, you will think I took coaching and come from a privileged family. How else will your shiny brain cope without putting people into its imaginary categories? >and thinks casteism doesn‚Äôt exist because his blind ass didn‚Äôt see it Another stupid assumption, your brain is reflecting sunlight at this point. Literally shows how your head is filled with prejudices. Take a look in the mirror if you want to see what kind of people become casteists. >who doesn‚Äôt even know how to calculate basic statistics, \"oh oh I mentioned bell curve, I know statistics\" what a sore loser you are. The non-serious ones aren't even preparing you dumbo. The guy who knows he isn't going to qualify won't complain when the result comes and he didn't get a IIT Bombay seat. You have to keep believing that generals who get into these colleges are casteists. How else are you going to keep up in your idiotic narratives? But \"sc victim broo, sc street cleaner\" . Your brain literally created a shithole of biases around you, and you are wriggling in the shit right now. You don't even know little facts about the game, and your ass burns when you are told about them. And why won't it when your tiny little room of shit starts falling apart. But \"\"general rich evil landlord, all general baaaad casteist\". Get out of your shithole, you dumbfuck and touch some grass. > How else will your shiny brain cope without putting people into its imaginary categories? From guy that is content to categorise students into ‚Äúnon-serious‚Äù and ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù based on literally nothing. > But \"\"general rich evil landlord, all general baaaad casteist\". > You have to keep believing that generals who get into these colleges are casteists. I‚Äôm from general caste, so who‚Äôs the shithead with biases now? Plus I don‚Äôt even need to ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù anything when casteism on campus [is already documented.](https://www.newslaundry.com/2023/03/28/stress-dropouts-suicides-unravelling-iits-casteism-problem) Keep projecting, privileged fatty. Will not change the fact that you‚Äôre making excuses for being a casteist bigot. P.S. Dalits being 99% of sanitation workers isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbias‚Äù it‚Äôs literally the result of a government survey. So thanks for establishing once more you‚Äôre just projecting when it comes to accusing others of ‚Äúnot knowing reality‚Äù. &#x200B; > From guy that is content to categorise students into ‚Äúnon-serious‚Äù and ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù based on literally nothing. I never said all those who get reservations are undeserving but you keep crying as if that was my argument. Ofcourse your reflective brain has to simplify, how else are you going to say anything? And how can someone literally believe that one million students are grinding day and night? Must have just looked at the number of applicants, and that was it. What a delusional shithole you live in. > Plus I don‚Äôt even need to ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù anything when casteism on campus [is already documented.](https://www.newslaundry.com/2023/03/28/stress-dropouts-suicides-unravelling-iits-casteism-problem) And when you see a case of sexual harassment on these campuses, you must start shouting that every student is a rapist. > Keep projecting, privileged fatty. Will not change the fact that you‚Äôre making excuses for being a casteist bigot. With all these prejudices in your mind and the behaviour of attaching attributes depending on caste, I can see who the bigot is. \"General got into college = rich and evil, ST got into college = poor victim\". Keep holding blinded stereotypes and call everyone who doesn't agree with you casteist. \"But you don't agree with me, you must be evil\" smooth-brained idiot. > P.S. Dalits being 99% of sanitation workers isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbias‚Äù it‚Äôs literally the result of a government survey Does that mean all who get into through reservation are victims?. \"ooh my poor victims\", Still pretending that only these workers getting benefited from reservations and it's not being exploited. \"but generals can't be victims vro, all generals are like me, rich fatties\", casteist idiot. Yes yes, not all reserved students are undeserving but whoever I say is undeserving is undeserving. Not all reserved students are non-serious but whoever I say is non-serious is non-serious. But I'm logical and you're biased. Imagine having such a severe lack of self awareness. Also if the number of \"undeserving\" reserved students isn't high what even are you wailing about and wasting so much time for? Fucking lol. > Still pretending that only these workers getting benefited from reservations and it's not being exploited More bs spouted with no sources. But Mr. meritdhaari can't be biased at all. Fucking lol. Keep digging, privileged fatty. > And when you see a case of sexual harassment on these campuses, you must start shouting that every student is a rapist. Ah, so any instance of sexual harassment or casteism is \"isolated incident\" and you can't say there is a culture of it, but your one dalit friend with 200 BMWs got in with reservation so it's a massively widespread problem. One more splendid example of a lack of extreme self-awareness. I‚Äôm from Earth and love you both. Wait, you don‚Äôt sound terribly genuine, and in fact you‚Äôre assuming the OP is being racist rather than being curious and young, or someone like me with mild neurocognitive disorder after TBI, I cherish the connections to the world I‚Äôm given because most of my life is spent boxed in by vicious discrimination in the subterranean collective subconscious. It‚Äôs not a life I‚Äôd want for anyone. In fact, as I have faced my own mortality I‚Äôm very aware that we aren‚Äôt here to exist in perpetuity. We better be here to cause no additional suffering in others, that‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôm fairly certain the OP offended you. But you actually showed OP another example, albeit less overt, of your snide bullying and accusations made as commentary and dripping with animus for groups of other human beings. Slice people up all you want there‚Äôs a part of some of us in most of all the possible boxes such that all of us share some box with everyone. So what is OP‚Äôs purpose? Not to hurt you or offend you - any time to think on this before reading into it would reassure you OP can‚Äôt have meant to hurt you because he has no idea you exist. Did he offend you? It certainly seems so. But how can he offend anyone who he 1) doesn‚Äôt know or understand with sufficient particularity; and, 2) we don‚Äôt have any evidence OP meant to offend anyone; and 3) we don‚Äôt even know OP nor understand where they‚Äôre at in life and what motivated this question; and lastly, 4) perhaps OP would clarify your assumptions about OP‚Äôs nationality, about cricket, about the values and outcomes of wider harmony or other interests that actually likely align you two more than make each other‚Äôs stance inapposite to the dignity of the other. Frankly, you offended yourself and projected your personal feelings in a bounded state with your knowledge, a poorly structured concept of reality to implant on another simply because it‚Äôs in your mind. Two minds never really can understand the others‚Äô reasoning, and we largely (convincingly) make up our own reasons for our actions and beliefs. I think the best choice here is to approach curiosity with the same. Be honest about your feelings and invite this person - initially terrible in your assessment- to share what feelings they have and understand both your experiences are real and true to their owners. They are passing by through the mind. They are the mind, briefly, sometimes partially, but needn‚Äôt ever come to define the mind state as only capable of what is then and there possessing it, and the mind is also never a fair definition of the person‚Äôs character in the moment or over time. Especially not the second. People become what they ingest and attend to and the least we can do is not feed strangers our hateful mind‚Äôs hurt and angry leftovers. It‚Äôs a good rule that favors you, actually, and it may or may not reach to effect another, but at least you won‚Äôt contribute to their hazardous mind state and probably serve to improve them. But hey, you can do as you wish and find the consequences are to live where they‚Äôre grown, in form or shadow, but important to keep yourself aware so we all don‚Äôt continue to cause confusion and conflict in ourselves and others. Be well. Sadly this still happens. People who have done Jackshit in their lives are still pretty supremacist regarding their castes ü§¢. Upper Castes are yet to learn from their mistakes and will instead keep complaining Bout Reservations. Its plainly disgusting. News is that This man house is getting bulldozed by govt. I dont know if it has been done or not. Fuck Caste Supremacy. Basically there waere few chances of social mobility. Few But Brits began their own Caste Profiling through Census of India and mde the system more rigid. You do realise that qoute was an Obiter Dicta. It didnt have any effect on judgement. Also she had already crossed the limit of 24 weeks prescribed for Rape victims in MTP Act. She would have been denied anyways as the Medical Board didn't approve her abortion too. I‚Äôd also add that people should read the one with Arundhati Roy‚Äôs introduction. Some of the most powerful writing I‚Äôve read to date. It‚Äôs crazy how we never actually go through the works of freedom movement leaders in our history and civics classes in school. We spend years not really learning and understanding their lives their thinking. The reductionist approach to codify the birth of india into fixed Q&A is the problem. No Jaggu would twist it so make one feel like they‚Äôre feeling Stockholm syndrome and accept it as the norm. PS: I don‚Äôt hold him in high regard, I‚Äôve found him to be extremely deceptive and capable of manipulating folks with progressive ideas. > You do realise that qoute was an Obiter Dicta. And you see no issues in a high court judge whose opinions come from manusmriti. > Also she had already crossed the limit of 24 weeks prescribed for Rape victims in MTP Act. Why don't you take a look at why she went past the limit in the first place? I agree, Manusmriti should not be quoted while handing out decisions Well those reasons weren't mentioned in that article ig. What were they? My main point was denial regarding abortion after passing limit is not as uncommon. After 24 weeks, approval procedure is really stringent. So even if he didn't qoutes Manusmriti the results would have been same. He is manipulative as hell!! All his videos Play on the viewer's conscience, berating them for not doing something. I remember one time Youtube recommended a new video of his extolling the purported benefits of pure ghee made from Indian cows. It was trending and I also saw it make the rounds around the residents group uncles on Whatsapp. Then month later, I got an ad announcing Isha newly launching pure desi cow ghee. It is all his money making Empire. One thing does not rule out the other. Btw there has never been a Muslim majority population in the Subcontinent. This did happen. This is an extreme and isolated case. But that doesn't mean the whole of India is like that. Casteism can definitely be seen in some rural parts of India. But our generation is getting over this bs. Me being a lower caste myself can affirm to that. All societies have evils and this is ours. But I don't want foreigners to believe that this is normal, because it's not. In most cities people don't care about what caste you are and just go about their business. metrics does not always show the ground reality. Look at the employability of these graduates. Look at how many engineers are applying for the post of puenes and clerks / working as salesmen / doing delivery in swiggy / zomato etc. Graduates today are struggling really hard to score a job. See in MIT in chennai and find out how many students from Tamilnadu are studying there. Similar case in any premier institution in Tamilnadu. Keeping this metrics aside - The current CM himself openly asked an old person about his caste :). The great socialist reformer EV Ramasamy Naicker proudly called himself a naicker and used his caste name in the paper he published. Look at the candidates posted in any constituency by any major political party - its predominantly caste dependent except in case of really top powerful leaders like Karunanidhi / Jayalalitha or in traditional party bastions. Why did Kanimoli go to thoothukudi to contest and not in other cities? Its her caste as Nadar that has a major vote base in thoothukudi. Just a few examples. Sadly even after 60+ years of dravidian politics, Tamilnadu is highly caste based, it just doesn't talk openly about it but is no different from the neighbouring kerala / karnataka / andhra where people openly use their caste / family names in their name. Have you read the hate and misinformation about Dr. Ambedkar or reddit. I mean I don't have much expectations from such a platform as Indian users are comparatively less, but most of these resort to insults, memes and stupidity. Regardless, it's good you mentioned it. Most retards(check the absolute stupidity prevalent on Twitter) think it's an attack on Hinduism and call him hate mongers. They forget and don't care to read history. You can also read excerpts and preface on Columbia University's website. I did. For me there was no way to clear History without mugging up. And I scored pretty well so I would say it worked out well. There is big divide in India due to caste, far less in South India but even then when you're looking for marriage suddenly everyone is talking about Caste. Mind your own damn business, buddy Cz cows a animal maderchord India is a country which is losing its morals and values dya by day thanks to the fanatic religions and idiologies. The politicians and priests are busy in pouring money on nonsense projects. The caste system should have gone away after Independence but if it goes away ,how will the ego of the upper caste survive? Things were moving towards an intellectual and understanding based society till the year 2014 but after that there is a blast from fanatics again as the current ruling party with it brings the colors of religion. Young India is already in the trap of upper and lower castes. In schools and colleges offices and various other institutions,the caste system is still there and that too on a large scale. Even if you go to major metro cities like Mumbai or Delhi people are foolishly under the impression of higher and lower caste and prefer to stay in their own casts and religions. All these things are because of fanatic terrorist religious organisations. What ever glamour you see it is only a show off. Real India still sleeps hungry somewhere,or is raped and thrown in forests or is waiting for justice due to some or the other issue. How Indians are made fools and exploited? Religion and priests exploit their spiritual needs,politicians exploit their social and security needs,Bollywood exploits their sexual needs, cricket exploits their need of ambition and success and whatever remains is exploited in the name of fear and inferiority complex(as taught by caste system from 10k years) 9/10 Indian relationships are pseudo,social status matters and above all the ego boosts matters. People in the West are at least honest about their own mentality. The Indian mind is cunning and pretends to be very clever. On one hand they need science and on the other they have all kinds of superstition carved on their bones. In the name of spirituality India is moving slowly towards doom. There is no spirituality remaining. People will go to temples like beggars and ask for materialistic things. With time you may even see the entire caste system back in its dark glory soon. Beacuse the rulling party is trying its best to do so. There are many aspects to consider. Nobody can save India's doom. This debate ends when you realise that our president is from a ST community and prime minister from OBC community > how t A local can generally understand a person's caste from his or her surname, that is true. I understand your question is how is that surname related to caste? The answer to that is, that surname has historically been associated with people following a certain trade. For example, my surname is \"Karmakar\". The locals would immediately recognize that I am from the jeweller caste (\"Sonar\" in Bengali) because \"Karmakars\" have traditionally been in the jewellery making business from father to sons. Even today you can see that. If you were to visit West Bengal state of India, even today you will see many jewellery shops with the name \"<some first name> Karmakar & sons\". But \"Karmakar\" is not always fixed as a jeweller caste all over India. Caste definitions varies from region to region because ethnicity and language changes. Hell, I myself don't know which surname is a jeweller in another region of India. But from what I gathered that in other parts of northern India, jewellers are not marked under a specific caste but falls under a broad umbrella of trader/mercantile castes (\"Baniya\" in Hindi). I known one specific surname as an example of this who are \"Baniya\" but whose family business has been jewellery - Agrawal Hope this answers some of your questions."
