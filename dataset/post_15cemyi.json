    "selftext": "This year, Wipro offered 6.5 lakhs for many highly skilled freshers but later withdrew and offered 3.5 lakhs instead. A highly unethical and cheating behaviour by Azim premji and his son which no other IT company has done, given that placements were over. Now 92% of these freshers have accepted the offer(not as if they had much choice left because Wipro timed the withdrawal of original offers after the placements had ended everywhere). Why is there no protest or legal action against Wipro? \n\nIn related news, they bought 12000 crores rupees of their own shares. They have that much money to buy back their own shares and increase their shares value by reducing the number of shares in circulation. Share buy back is a double win for promoters. Their ownership and wealth is increased because they have lesser shares circulating and more control.",

        "Demand and supply? Wtf?\n\nThey were duped. Many of the people who approached the job may not have even approached it if the final offer of 3.5 was set previously. Let's say I offer you a contract of 10l so you don't look for other offers and when the offers had dried up everywhere I say no no the contract is now worth 5L. Is this not fraud?",

        "Common? This HAS BECOME COMMON in last 2 years. This was not the case prior to Covid. \n\nOur SC has forced companies previously to pay fines when the offers were withdrawn from students who had gotten them from IIMs. It is not like this is the norm. \n\nI am not saying not to take the offer. If someone can't afford to wait or needs it urgently, take it. I am saying this is definitely a liable case against the companies. One can definitely sue for this behaviour. Or atleast file a complaint.",

        "Well students have no option they can't be unemployed after investing so much in education. And these corporation are taking undue advantage of them.",
        "That's because campus placements are probably over and they have no option to accept this offer while they search off campus for an alternate more respectable role. 3.5LPA is way too less for anyone nevermind students who've spent a lot of time and money.",
        "Wipro is a dogshit company, many Westerners who work for it completely hate it. I don't know why it's ever seen as a reputable company in India. Probably because of H1B lmao",

        "There is a difference between unfair, unethical and illegal.\n\nA job offer is not a binding contract which is why you can sign and accept an offer letter and still go for a different company with a better offer without thinking about penalty for breach of contract. Both sides can walk away from the offer at any time.\n\nIf there is a onus on employer to honor an offer letter once its issued and signed, then there will be an onus on the employee as well to honor it and join that company even if they have a better offer else where. How many people would like such a liability?\n\nPeople need to understand that a job offer is a letter of intent and nothing more. It can be changed or revoked anytime till the time the candidate actually gets appointed and confirmed as full time employee after the probation period. Which is why you should be careful with whom you interview during placement season and to ensure you have alternatives in place. \n\nEven after you get onboarded, you are a temp worker for the duration of the probation period. You can be fired without stating a reason during the probation period. You also don't have an entitlement to a permanent job at the end of it. You get the rights of a full time employee only a after your appointment is confirmed.\n\nKnow your rights and know the risks and plan accordingly. It is definitely unfair and unethical of a company to revoke or change a job offer, but its not illegal and its most certainly not fraud. You read and agreed to these terms when you signed the offer.",
        "The main priority for a fresher is to get placed. The salary amount does not matter to most freshers and these companies are taking advantage of that.",

        "They did an extremely shitty thing but an employer has every right to withdraw an offer and give a lower one, unless employment contracts were signed. Honestly, even after employment contracts are signed, many companies in India do borderline illegal stuff because labour laws here are pretty weak and enforcement is even weaker. Couple that with massive population and shortage of jobs and this is what you get. No one is really competing for freshers.",
        "What happened is *literally* illegal in a lot of countries. \n\n*literally* nothing to do with demand and supply.",
        "Doing this after placement season is basically over and knowing how horrible the job market is... man what a scam",

        "The issue is the campus placements system. Honestly, it makes Indians complacent and companies also do not have incentive to hire talent outside campuses. This means if you screwed up once in your campus, you get screwed in career. As the first job determines a lot. \n\nIndia is the only country with such a strong campus placement system. Ideally, if there wasn’t such a system, talented students can apply across companies as companies would also be looking for freshers outside campuses.",

They multiple times make it clear that they have the right to sue or go to courts if you don't join after taking the offer or leave in between the probationary period. They get your sign on that. They don't enforce because they know if they do that people will stop joining the company itself. \n\nSo they don't sue because that will be harmful for them itself.",
