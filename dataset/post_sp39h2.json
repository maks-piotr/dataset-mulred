    "selftext": "I was gifted a Jabra Elite 65 T. I knew they weren't the perfect set of TWS earphones but they were in a lot of people's top 5 with the non-touch sweat-resistant function and the deep discounts that Jabra offered on a product that was priced at Rs. 16K\n\nAs expected one year down the line one of the earphones stopped working and I went in a never-ending loop with Jabra to get the product replaced. It has been over 3 months, I first reached out to them via their website on Nov 2, and I don't see an end to it just yet.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is to spend a few more bucks or don't, and buy a cheaper alternative. Just don't buy Jabra. You don't want this sort of a hassle even after paying big bucks.  \n\n\nEdit: For those of you who don't believe me. Please just visit @ Jabra\\_Support on Twitter and read the comments. I am sharing a screenshot here. You'll find every Indian handle complaining in a similar manner. Their post sales service is super shitty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpw8sz5xm1h81.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=716416e97d40b9e224689b7459beb8f45ab9a4d2",
