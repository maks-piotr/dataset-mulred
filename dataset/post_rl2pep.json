        "- back4blood is an amazing co-op fps. playing with friends is when the game comes alive. killing hordes of zombies. good ol' left4dead vibes.\n\n- forza 5 is such a beautiful racing game. it's not hardcore racing simulator. Just a colourful, enjoyable, fast-paced racing game.\n\n- Red Dead Online is still one of the best open world games. The details &amp; graphics are still unmatched imo. Campaign story was very powerful.",

I never run out of them though\n\n**Chronicles Of Riddick  : Escape From Butcher Bay**- The game is awesome. \nBUT\n\nI was surprised when it was listed as one of the best stealth games though. A big part of stealth games is emphasising pacifist playthroughs and multiple options. Riddick does none of that. Every enemy is supposed to be killed . Later on you get a stun gun but its very short timed.  There arent multiple options either.  There is only one. Destroy everything and kill everyone. Sure one or two times you can go through by taking one choice instead of the either. But only a few times. Other than that its pretty. Very beautiful. Its fun. The darkness feels real comfortable. Riddick is badass. I recommend the Trilogy of movies for anyone who wants to see a good fun movie.",
