        "On Friday, a Delhi Court granted bail to one Gangadhar Rangnath Gunde, “wrongly” arrested by the CBI in place of another man with the same name, who is accused of being in touch with persons allegedly involved in the NEET paper leaks case in Bihar.\n\nArrested on 26 June from Dehradun, Gangadhar Gunde was in police custody till June 30 and in judicial custody for 12 days. A resident of Gurugram, Gangadhar Gunde was intercepted last month while on his way from Uttarakhand to Mussoorie by the Dehradun police, which was assisting the CBI.\n\nCountering the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Gangadhar Gunde’s bail application said, “…the Gangadhar named in the FIR is not the Gangadhar Rangnath Gunde, but another Gangadhar who has been arrested by the CBI and he has been given CBI custody for two days. Only the name of this Gangadhar matches with the original accused…”\n\n“There is not a single word that has been found against me in this case…I don’t even know what the NEET examination is,” said Kailas More representing the accused before the Delhi Court.\n\nMore stated that the only reason for arresting Gangadhar Gunde was that he had contacted another accused, Sanjay Tukaram Jadhav.\n\nJadhav and Gangadhar Gunde had met last October to settle a matrimonial dispute involving the latter’s daughters, said the lawyer. “…this is how Gangadhar Gunde got introduced to Sanjay Jadhav and met him for first on 2nd October 2023…thereafter Gangadhar Gunde never contacted Sanjay Jadhav…,” the bail application stated.\n\nOn the other hand, the CBI said that they had two Gangadhars in custody and only an absconding Iranna Kongulwar (accused) could tell them who is the Gangadhar involved.\n\n“There is no such case of mistaken identity…the accused is misleading the Court,” the CBI stated.\n\nA detailed order by the Court in this matter is awaited.\n\nLawyer More further said the name of the real accused was N Gangadhar Appa, who was later arrested.\n\nEarlier this week, the CBI had conducted searches at 15 locations in Bihar and Jharkhand, where they found incriminating evidence in the case, sources said. The agency had earlier arrested the principal and vice-principal of Hazaribagh-based Oasis School in Jharkhand in connection with the case and two people who allegedly had lent the premises to NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) candidates where burnt question papers were recovered by the Bihar Police.",
