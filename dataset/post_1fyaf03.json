    "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyaf03",
    "selftext": "\nSo recently, I bought an Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 laptop, and it has a screen bleeding issue, so I requested a replacement. However, Flipkart cancelled both of my replacement requests, claiming there was no stock available from the seller. After that, the app showed that they would giving a refund, but later, even the refund was cancelled.\n\nI’ve been trying my best to address this issue seriously and have contacted them through various channels. The main story is, today (7th Oct) evening, I got a call from someone who asked about the problem I was facing. I explained everything to him and told him that if I only get a refund, it would be a loss for me because I had used a credit card discount, and now the laptop's price is higher. He said they could only give me a refund, but they would take an online meeting with me and, after the refund is credited, allow me to buy the laptop again at the same price. I agreed to the meeting.\n\nThe first red flag was that he sent me an APK (TeamViewer ) instead of a regular meeting link. \n\nWhile I was trying to download the app, my phone showed a warning saying, \"This file can be harmful,\" but I still downloaded it.\n\nWhen the app installed, it asked for several permissions: 1) Camera, 2) Mic, and 3) Screen share or record (I’m a little confused on this one). I allowed all permissions. Also he ask for write a mail to customer care on call .\n\nAfterward, he asked me to open the Flipkart app (which was already installed) and told me to click on the camera option and show my credit card by holding it in front of the camera, both front and back, and say, “I need payment on this.” I knew that even if he got the number and CVV, he would still need an OTP to make any transaction.\n\n However, I got suspicious because the credit card I used wasn’t mine – it was my friend's. At this point, I got angry and told him, “You said the refund would be processed to the original payment method (the credit card), and you should already have my details because the money should go to the same account.” He insisted, saying, “Sir, you still need to show it.”\n\nI told him, \"Sorry, I can’t show you the credit card, even if nothing happens.\"\n\nSome key points I noticed:\n\n- The WhatsApp number was not verified like other Flipkart business accounts, and it showed that the number was created just one month ago.\n\n- The app he sent is already available on the Play Store, so why send an APK file instead?\n\n- There's no major issue with the laptop, aside from the screen bleeding and the fact that the laptop crashed 3-4 times since I bought it.\n\nIf anyone has faced a similar experience, please let me know what I should do. Your advice would be really helpful.\n\n",

He ofcourse didnt know you paid using your friends account, so the otp wont be coming on your phone in which he had made you install that app.\n\nComplain to flipkart regarding this whole thing as well. You might save others from making such mistakes.",

The card was my friend. I don't have any payment app which contact to bank at  mobile. The account which I have also has zero balance 😶. \n\n\nAs I know and I already had idea. I cancelled the screen sharing, mic , camera permission etc. Scan the phone. Remove file which i feel can be related to it.\n\n\nAs much I know , if any malware running under the system or at background they need battery. Till now battery working as usual.",

And companies like Flipkart or even banks are not going to contact your mobile number through a normal 10-digit number. They have different numbers starting with 022",
        "The thing is how these scammers come to know requests of replacement or refund by buyers. I think the internal people maybe FK staff or maybe sellers themselves are involved in scamming people.\n\nHappened in 2022 with a BSNL recharge of an elderly person I know. MOD was same, sent an apk of TViewer to install and then khatak khatak 4 major transactions before this person could stop TV or anything else. More than a lakh was used to purchase online stuff in some foreign country.\n\nso i think \"kuch to gadbad hai daya\".",

        "Everyone has mentioned most of the stuff already. Do not install apks ever. Try to be more vigilant. \n\nTwo important things:\n\n1. Check your list of installed apps, if something else and malicious was installed. If you see a suspicious and it can be uninstall, do it. If you see an empty row on the list, it's a common scam so you don't see the hidden app. Uninstall the app on that empty row as you would any other app. \n\n2. Not all credit card transactions require an OTP. RBI has recently made it mandatory, but I have many subscriptions that don't need an OTP. Never share your CVV with anyone.",
        "Take a backup and do a factory reset.",
        "When you use a credit card, you are using bank's own money. So if you buy something and the product is shit/scam, you file a chargeback form with the bank. The bank's fraud team sees the validity of your claims and refunds you. Since they also have other customers scammed by the same seller, they can also take care of filing stronger criminal cases since it's their money being lost.",
        "lol",
        "Apk once installed might be able to capture keystrokes or grab screenshots etc so when you log into your banking app it can capture your password, bank account info, credit card info etc. and send it back to the hacker",

Don't be like let's see what could happen after i install a random apk sent from someone random person in WhatsApp.. and what you're talking about those apps movies capcut they don't have all the permissions while running only storage and internet so they might steal ur data but it doesn't gonna harm u. Never ever try these shits.",
        "Man sometimes I wonder how people can be so irresponsible. By allowing all permissions you basically gave whole access of your device. Now if that guy is pro then he would plant a small executable file that will be executed later to steal the data. Even if you think they will need otp now that he has access he can anyway extract text messages. Also it's just common sense to not install app from anywhere except the play store. \nI would suggest you to transfer your data to pc and format the device.",
        "Never buy anything super expensive online anything above 20k",
        "TeamViewer has official APK listed on playstore, you installed it via a third party APK, you need to uninstall that app and do factory reset, that APK is probably modded to swoop data from your phone.",

        "Some scammer employee or delivery partner sold your details to his scammer friend.",
        "Not just that. Even apps from the Playstore can contain malicious code. It's just a bit safer compared to APKs. \n\nAny app you give permission to your storage can access anything on your phone and send it to their servers. This is one of the ways people end up being the victims of blackmail scams. Imagine if OP has some private photos which were uploaded when he gave storage permissions or an Excel with his bank details or passwords. It's an open playground for scammers the moment you install an app from an unverified source and give them permissions.\n\nAlso, to answer OPs question on casually installing any other APKs is also dangerous. But, the fact that most of them are open source or if it's publicly available, there is atleast some chance that someone figures out there is some malicious code in it. The fact that you just installed the particular APK the guy on the other end sent you means that you gave the scammer exactly what he wanted. It's like buying something from a chor bazaar and buying something from a chor.",

        "Why are you taking this so lightly?\n\n> just asked for camera and mic permissions\n\nDo you know how serious of an issue this is? You gave permissions to completely unauthorised apk, which the scammer used to gain access to your phone. And you are not even acknowledging that you made a mistake. Do you understand how fucked you are? \n\nALL AND I MEAN ALL OF YOUR DATA IS WITH THE SCAMMER. People keep telling you this but you are repeating that why you can safely download video editing apps. \n\nHow can one claim to know about phishing attacks, social engineering, etc and be this ignorant? \n\nThose apps you are talking about are downloaded from verified sites. They are pre-scanned for malicious code and if they pass the scan they are safe. That's when the sites host the app for downloads.\n\nThe APK you downloaded from a random guy who claimed to be Flipkart is NEVER EVER SAFE.\n\nThat guy now has access to your camera feeds. He can record photos and videos, of you or people around you, from your phone and can try to blackmail you. Do you understand how serious that is?\n\nAdditionally he has all you contacts, bank details, location and everything in your phone. Doesn't matter if you gave permission or not. That guy has\ns all that data. \n\nHow are you able to not grasp the grave mistake you've just done?\n\nYou claim that you already know that guy is a scammer. Then why did you engage with him and install the APK? \n\nHow dumb do you have to be to do this?\n\nFactory reset your phone. Block all your bank cards and apply for new ones. Keep monitoring your phone for suspicious activities. \n\nLearn from this mistake. Have some awareness on how to protect yourself in future from things like these. \n\nThis is not the end. Scammers will try again because you fell into the trap. It will be a new scam. Be vigilant and stop being such a moron and come to terms with the fact that you made a mistake.",
        "Hi OP, do you have any idea regarding how they got your number or came to know that you've bought a laptop from Flipkart? Trying to understand whether the seller is leaking this data (not sure if Flipkart shares customer info with sellers) or its Flipkart itself, in which case this is a huge problem.",
        "You knew, yet you still installed the apk despite all the red flags? You r something else. Thankfully, you didn't share your card details. Also, considering it was your friend's card, the OTP will be received on your friend's phone and not yours. \n\nBut if this was ur card and he had the card details, he can pull OTP from ur phone with that app."

However, Flipkart cancelled both of my replacement requests, claiming there was no stock available from the seller. After that, the app showed that they would giving a refund, but later, even the refund was cancelled. I’ve been trying my best to address this issue seriously and have contacted them through various channels. The main story is, today (7th Oct) evening, I got a call from someone who asked about the problem I was facing. I explained everything to him and told him that if I only get a refund, it would be a loss for me because I had used a credit card discount, and now the laptop's price is higher. He said they could only give me a refund, but they would take an online meeting with me and, after the refund is credited, allow me to buy the laptop again at the same price. I agreed to the meeting. The first red flag was that he sent me an APK (TeamViewer ) instead of a regular meeting link. While I was trying to download the app, my phone showed a warning saying, \"This file can be harmful,\" but I still downloaded it. When the app installed, it asked for several permissions: 1) Camera, 2) Mic, and 3) Screen share or record (I’m a little confused on this one). I allowed all permissions. Also he ask for write a mail to customer care on call . Afterward, he asked me to open the Flipkart app (which was already installed) and told me to click on the camera option and show my credit card by holding it in front of the camera, both front and back, and say, “I need payment on this.” I knew that even if he got the number and CVV, he would still need an OTP to make any transaction. However, I got suspicious because the credit card I used wasn’t mine – it was my friend's. At this point, I got angry and told him, “You said the refund would be processed to the original payment method (the credit card), and you should already have my details because the money should go to the same account.” He insisted, saying, “Sir, you still need to show it.” I told him, \"Sorry, I can’t show you the credit card, even if nothing happens.\" Some key points I noticed: - The WhatsApp number was not verified like other Flipkart business accounts, and it showed that the number was created just one month ago. - The app he sent is already available on the Play Store, so why send an APK file instead? - There's no major issue with the laptop, aside from the screen bleeding and the fact that the laptop crashed 3-4 times since I bought it. If anyone has faced a similar experience, please let me know what I should do. Your advice would be really helpful.",

Got it There is not a single info send of the card , just apl installed (Team viewer)and give camera and mic permission. You just got scammed. I would suggest you to uninstall the app and factory reset wiping the phone. I don't think they were real Flipkart agents. It's called social engineering. Sorry to say, but the only wise thing you did was to not show the credit card. From the moment you downloaded the APK, your phone is mostly compromised. Waise bhi abhi karne wala hu . I'm done now with everything. What if we install the apk of editing apk or movie app, where we don't faced any issue? I know about social engineering, phising, DDOs attack. The question is , of we download apk like capcut and other movies app than there is nothing happens. Does you have idea , how to know does it compromise or not ? Scam hai bhai. bachkar rehe Could very well be one of the seller's employee, he cancelled the refund and tried to scam you. He ofcourse didnt know you paid using your friends account, so the otp wont be coming on your phone in which he had made you install that app. Complain to flipkart regarding this whole thing as well. You might save others from making such mistakes. No bro,how he get refund or replacement if he delete Flipkart account.so don't delete Flipkart account.just do a factory reset. That why I made this post. Does apk affect my mobile? Absolutely File chargeback got big orders man. I would rather risk my account and card being blacklisted in the merchant's ecosystem than installing apks and shit. What is chargeback ? Bhai abb katt Chuka h! Did you complaint via twitter? If yes, check email who replied to you Bro just uninstall it asap, it is remote access app. He needed your card number and cvv only as he already has access to everything on your mobile. From messages to pictures. How can you do such thing when there are a million people on the internet advising against it. Just uninstall it and if you can just format your device. As they already have a remote access to everything on your device. Kya ? No firstly from official website/app and they call me every week 2-3 time because of replace, so I thought it can be same call because I just reached them or text them on twitter official account. I never send or show the credit card number, CVV etc. It's just mobile camera and mic permission for that apk when you say various channels where did you seek help? Did you leave your number? It's kind of zoom, Google ( APK called TeamViewer- ) type app, i paused everytime if someone sensative there. They apk just ask for camera and mic permission and screen sharing not like \" Jo apne aap chata hai\" kind a just a screen share like Google meeting. Plus point there is not a single details of card in mobile ( just front image ). The card was my friend. I don't have any payment app which contact to bank at mobile. The account which I have also has zero balance 😶. As I know and I already had idea. I cancelled the screen sharing, mic , camera permission etc. Scan the phone. Remove file which i feel can be related to it. As much I know , if any malware running under the system or at background they need battery. Till now battery working as usual. Twitter, There chatbot , Acer technican, they call officially which I know and isliye laga Aaj bhi call aaya hoga . Pata to starting se lag raha tha kuch gadbad hai. Payment ka baat aaya to Mai confirm ho gaya . F. Contact your bank to not allow any transactions on your account until you fix shit. I shared nothing, just Camera, mic permission because apk was like Google meeting. Card was my friends. Flipkart is full of scammers now. Starting from customer support to delivery person. Scam.. Bhai Tera kat gaya, ye flipkart hai hi nahi.. it’s a scam app. Are you out of your sense to install new app and now report in flipkart app downloaded from play store? It's a scam of course where the person wanted to get OTP for buying something And if you share the credit details I'm sure he expected to get an OTP on your mobile which will pop-up and just within a second he will notice the OTP and buy anything from it. P.S. And companies like Flipkart or even banks are not going to contact your mobile number through a normal 10-digit number. They have different numbers starting with 022 The thing is how these scammers come to know requests of replacement or refund by buyers. I think the internal people maybe FK staff or maybe sellers themselves are involved in scamming people. Happened in 2022 with a BSNL recharge of an elderly person I know. MOD was same, sent an apk of TViewer to install and then khatak khatak 4 major transactions before this person could stop TV or anything else. More than a lakh was used to purchase online stuff in some foreign country. so i think \"kuch to gadbad hai daya\". If you download it through Google Play Store, google Play Protect will scan the APK and make sure its not malicious. And there are a few other reputed play store alternatives but better not to use it if you have the app available on google play store. I love your innocence. People dont give permission to the real apps downloaded from AppStore or playstore. Everyone has mentioned most of the stuff already. Do not install apks ever. Try to be more vigilant. Two important things: 1. Check your list of installed apps, if something else and malicious was installed. If you see a suspicious and it can be uninstall, do it. If you see an empty row on the list, it's a common scam so you don't see the hidden app. Uninstall the app on that empty row as you would any other app. 2. Not all credit card transactions require an OTP. RBI has recently made it mandatory, but I have many subscriptions that don't need an OTP. Never share your CVV with anyone. Take a backup and do a factory reset. When you use a credit card, you are using bank's own money. So if you buy something and the product is shit/scam, you file a chargeback form with the bank. The bank's fraud team sees the validity of your claims and refunds you. Since they also have other customers scammed by the same seller, they can also take care of filing stronger criminal cases since it's their money being lost. lol Apk once installed might be able to capture keystrokes or grab screenshots etc so when you log into your banking app it can capture your password, bank account info, credit card info etc. and send it back to the hacker Just do factory reset install the apps again... Don't be like let's see what could happen after i install a random apk sent from someone random person in WhatsApp.. and what you're talking about those apps movies capcut they don't have all the permissions while running only storage and internet so they might steal ur data but it doesn't gonna harm u. Never ever try these shits. Man sometimes I wonder how people can be so irresponsible. By allowing all permissions you basically gave whole access of your device. Now if that guy is pro then he would plant a small executable file that will be executed later to steal the data. Even if you think they will need otp now that he has access he can anyway extract text messages. Also it's just common sense to not install app from anywhere except the play store. I would suggest you to transfer your data to pc and format the device. Never buy anything super expensive online anything above 20k TeamViewer has official APK listed on playstore, you installed it via a third party APK, you need to uninstall that app and do factory reset, that APK is probably modded to swoop data from your phone. Khatrin k Khiladi ka 1st prize koi OP ko do bhai 🥲🤣 Some scammer employee or delivery partner sold your details to his scammer friend. Not just that. Even apps from the Playstore can contain malicious code. It's just a bit safer compared to APKs. Any app you give permission to your storage can access anything on your phone and send it to their servers. This is one of the ways people end up being the victims of blackmail scams. Imagine if OP has some private photos which were uploaded when he gave storage permissions or an Excel with his bank details or passwords. It's an open playground for scammers the moment you install an app from an unverified source and give them permissions. Also, to answer OPs question on casually installing any other APKs is also dangerous. But, the fact that most of them are open source or if it's publicly available, there is atleast some chance that someone figures out there is some malicious code in it. The fact that you just installed the particular APK the guy on the other end sent you means that you gave the scammer exactly what he wanted. It's like buying something from a chor bazaar and buying something from a chor. Did you write a review or something? It's not that difficult. There might be scammers bribing delivery agents for the info of the recipients. It wouldn't be that difficult in India where data privacy laws are near non-existent. Apk 🧐 stay away Why are you taking this so lightly? > just asked for camera and mic permissions Do you know how serious of an issue this is? You gave permissions to completely unauthorised apk, which the scammer used to gain access to your phone. And you are not even acknowledging that you made a mistake. Do you understand how fucked you are? ALL AND I MEAN ALL OF YOUR DATA IS WITH THE SCAMMER. People keep telling you this but you are repeating that why you can safely download video editing apps. How can one claim to know about phishing attacks, social engineering, etc and be this ignorant? Those apps you are talking about are downloaded from verified sites. They are pre-scanned for malicious code and if they pass the scan they are safe. That's when the sites host the app for downloads. The APK you downloaded from a random guy who claimed to be Flipkart is NEVER EVER SAFE. That guy now has access to your camera feeds. He can record photos and videos, of you or people around you, from your phone and can try to blackmail you. Do you understand how serious that is? Additionally he has all you contacts, bank details, location and everything in your phone. Doesn't matter if you gave permission or not. That guy has s all that data. How are you able to not grasp the grave mistake you've just done? You claim that you already know that guy is a scammer. Then why did you engage with him and install the APK? How dumb do you have to be to do this? Factory reset your phone. Block all your bank cards and apply for new ones. Keep monitoring your phone for suspicious activities. Learn from this mistake. Have some awareness on how to protect yourself in future from things like these. This is not the end. Scammers will try again because you fell into the trap. It will be a new scam. Be vigilant and stop being such a moron and come to terms with the fact that you made a mistake. Hi OP, do you have any idea regarding how they got your number or came to know that you've bought a laptop from Flipkart? Trying to understand whether the seller is leaking this data (not sure if Flipkart shares customer info with sellers) or its Flipkart itself, in which case this is a huge problem. You knew, yet you still installed the apk despite all the red flags? You r something else. Thankfully, you didn't share your card details. Also, considering it was your friend's card, the OTP will be received on your friend's phone and not yours. But if this was ur card and he had the card details, he can pull OTP from ur phone with that app."
