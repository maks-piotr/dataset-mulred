    "selftext": "I just came across a woman on Tiktok who is searching for her missing daughter in Mumbai, India. There is not much I can do, but I‚Äôll give this a try.\n\nI copied and pasted a summary from Google \n\nIn September 2016, Insiya was abducted to India at the age of two, where she still resides. Insiya's father is said to have hired several men to kidnap his daughter abroad. Insiya's wealthy father Shehzad H. is seen as the originator of the child abduction. He and his ex-partner Nadia Rashid are embroiled in a divorce.27 Jun 2018\n\nShe was kidnapped from the country she was born in by her mother‚Äôs abusive ex husband (Insiya‚Äôs father). Insiya has a dutch passport and was kidnapped to India..  She is apparently living with her father in Mumbai who kidnapped her from her mother in the Netherlands. I‚Äôm not sure why India is not helping? I‚Äôve read that the Indian government just sees it as a father who took is daughter to his own country and I‚Äôve read that the father is \nrich and everyone knows him? \n\nI also read that two of the kidnappers were sentenced to 8.5 years in prison. \n\nPlease take a look at the link and spread awareness in your community üôèüèª\n\nhttps://www.bringinsiyaback.nl/about-the-case/\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@bringinsiyaback?_t=8n72pNbnppt&_r=1\n\n",

        "If she was 2 when she was kidnapped in 2016, she would be around 10 years old now - old enough to reach out to her mother. I hope she somehow gets to read about this ordeal online and finds a way round connect with her mother.",
        "These is an international treaty that prevent such kidnapping of children by their own parents. Countries cooperate and help return kids to the parent who has the legal custody. Unfortunately, India is one of the few countries who is not a part of the treaty.

        "Whoa",
        "Maybe the mother would have better luck getting her daughter back if she filed for custody in an Indian court, rather than social media drama.\n\n\n\n\nThere's no abduction here, it's a family situation that's gone south. There are courts to resolve these matters. Social media likes and tears can do absolutely nothing here.",
        "She likely has another mother and won't either know about her biological mother or won't have any affection or connection to her by now.",
        "Why are parents kidnapping their own children?",
        "What makes you think someone would do this for likes?",
        "What else will this person get from social media, except for likes and sympathy or money via donations?\n\n\n\n\nShe's not getting her kid by ranting on the internet. She needs to go to the local Indian courts and that's the only way back.",
        "Look, as much as harsh as he sounds, he‚Äôs lowkey right yall, india won‚Äôt do shit, look at the top comment as someone said, india ain‚Äôt a part of the treaty which isn‚Äôt surprising, nothing really can be done on social media, she needs to go herself and get it done with her family or the support that she has ig for now, that‚Äôs the only right way for now",
        "I‚Äôve been following this case from the start on Facebook.. till now there‚Äôs no progress",
        "Isn't Japan also one who isn't in one of those treaties, i remember being disgusted watching a documentary where Japanese parents kidnap kids from the other parents and their govt not giving a shit. We are also doing the same",
        "Japan became a part of it in 2014.",
        "I usually dont say this, but this particular case sounds fishy.¬†\n\nShe can fly down to Mumbai or at least hire a lawyer, contact the police or the embassy(10 years probably a citizen). No one‚Äôs stopping her from doing that.¬†"
