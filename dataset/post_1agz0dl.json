    "selftext": "There is a building construction going on near by home and one of the construction worker carried some steel rod and he accidentally brought those rods near those electricity transformer wires. The other construction workers said that the rods he carried didn't even touch those wires, but it only just got near like 2 or 3 feet away. But anyway he got electrocuted. They initially took him to the near by govt hospital in my town, but the doctors asked asked to take them to Madurai city for further treatment.\n\nWe thought it is just some kind of minor burns. But we recently got the news that his one hand got amputated already and they are also discussing to remove his another hand. He is a daily wage construction worker. To care of his medical expense we contacted impactguru and they helped in getting started his crowdfunding. If possible please make a donation here (even small amount like 100Rs is going to help his poor family) - [http://impactguru.com/s/48Lfi6](http://impactguru.com/s/48Lfi6)\n\n(Please open that link with caution, as they have included his image there)",
