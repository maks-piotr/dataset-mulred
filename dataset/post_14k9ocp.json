        "I think the people deserved to know about the queues forming. If the media is concerned about the effects of it then they are free to provide context, expert analysis and even narratives. Having said that I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if something like this happens in India, a reporter in a studio will claim that theyâ€™re at the scene, live, and in the queues while proceeding to speak absolute bs.",
        "I see your point. But that is where professional ethics come in picture, where the ideals and pragmatism are balanced.\n\nAnd then if your point holds true, then activism in journalism will fall obsolete, as usually this type of journalism tends to narrate an incident from a particular perspective while ignoring the other. Though one can argue about its ligitimacy, but can they disagree that activism also gives voice to the voiceless?",
        "What you mentioned will surely improve the journalistic standards, but we cannot overlook the fact that the very phrase \"bank in trouble\" and \"long queues\" will trigger a spiral down response, no matter how well worded it is. And the only way to avoid is to water it down, which again defies the gravity of situation.",

        "I understand but disagree. The value of a journalist, ideally,  is in imparting well researched information. If not then journalistic integrity is compromised. An extreme example of the compromise today can be seen in Russia where the journalists are reduced to pawns of the regime. Perhaps the journalists in Japan were pawns of the bourgeois capitalists and the media companies had vested interests in not informing people. I concede that nothing is ideal, and journalists have often been tools for rhetoric and propaganda. But then again- SHOULD the people have been informed? The answer is still yes for me.",
