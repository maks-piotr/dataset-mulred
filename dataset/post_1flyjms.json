Why did he decide to just spew this venom? Where is the root cause?\n2nd guy went one step further and directly wished for death of children and how much he would love to see children dying. \nI am sure if any children would actually die infront of him than he wouldn't feel happy. But just for the sake of hurting 1st person's felling, he stoop so low and wished for death of hundreds of children.
