    "selftext": "[El Salvador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtLiQnXC7sQ) (documentary), a country with a population of 63 lakhs, has stopped the gang war by making tough laws. In just three years, they've arrested 70,000 gang members. These strict laws have made El Salvador safer, with fewer murders, rapes, and other crimes compared to nearby countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they can control the gang war, why can't our government make strong rules to protect our women? It's sad to see so many news articles about rape every time we check the news. If the government can't give tough punishments like the death penalty, why can't they make the legal process faster instead of delaying it? I know sometimes people lie about rape, which ruins innocent lives. Even though there have been many cases, why hasn't our government solved this big problem? Fixing it would also help the party that makes the strict rules. It would bring more tourists and show that India is a safe place for women. Aren't these good enough reasons for the government to act?",

        "Because quite some people of the government were accused of doing those atrocities. Such strict laws would need them to be jailed too and no one wants that",

        ">These strict laws have made El Salvador safer, with fewer murders, rapes, and other crimes compared to nearby countries.\n\nDid you even watch the documentary? El Salvador didn't do this because of laws\n\nBukele took over institutions one by one, declared emergency and arrested any individual who even smelled of gang stench\n\nThey specially made a prison for these people, shoved them in like sheep and they are still there locked up. No due process. No lawyers, nothing\n\nThat's the price El Salvador has paid for their freedom \n\nThey've essentially become a dictatorship with Bukele as head of state.  It just so happens that Bukele has his country's need in top of his own and that's how this whole system is working.",
        "this is good, imo.",
        "Good for el salvador, which is ravaged by gangs, easily identifiable by their tattoos and behaviour.  \nHow do you propose to do this for rapists, who blend in with society?",
        "Missing the point\n\nAuthoritarian states work when they have people's interest in mind. Do you think if an authoritarian regime is  established in India it will work for India or will it fill its own pocket?\n\nWe just saw the obscenity that was electoral bonds. Do you think in an authoritarian regime the supreme court would do what it did?\n\nDo you think we'd be able to discuss this freely?",
        "Because no govt can go up against gangs in this country. West Bengal mai rehta hu, so I know ðŸ¥º",
        "no, im saying the fact that the state was taken over by a man with the right vision for the nation is good. democracy is overrated. those same rapists who blend in with society end up voting. not everyone is fit to rule or have their voices heard. reject democracy, embrace fascism",
        "i think a system where leaders are selected not on the basis of a popularity contest (aka democracy), but rather a thorough vetting process based on meritocracy, and ethics based tests is what we need. read up on third positionism, thats where i stand",
        "1. There aren't enough jails in India to lock them all up. They would need to build a new jail city the size of the entire country of El Salvador\n\n2.

And history has shown again and again and again and again and yet again and yet again that whenever you form a dictatorship and bypass the system, innocent people suffer as much as guilty ones. \n\nIn fact innocent people suffer more so. Who do you think will be hurt more from going to jail?
