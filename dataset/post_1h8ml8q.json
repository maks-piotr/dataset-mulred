    "selftext": "The moment you open it, you're greeted with the legendary \"Verifying user\" like it’s a crime to want to travel and \"Establishing secure connection\" a sequence so slow, it feels like they are building the internet from scratch just for us and are secretly judging your life choices: “Do you really need this ticket? Maybe walking is better for your health.”\n\nBy the time it finally \"verifies\" something , all the seats are gone, and someone else with worse internet speed has somehow booked their tickets.\n\nOh, their midnight maintenance routine! The nightly ritual where IRCTC shuts down to \"improve\" its already stellar performance. What are they doing in those 35 minutes(23:45 hrs to 00:20 hrs)? Rebooting the universe? Rebuilding the app pixel by pixel? Summoning ancient rail spirits to bless the servers? Because let’s be honest—it feels like nothing ever changes.\n\nIt’s not even a bug—it’s a personality trait at this point. IRCTC isn’t just an app or a website; it’s a whole mood. And that mood is chaos.",
