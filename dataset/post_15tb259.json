    "selftext": "I learnt recently that only three civilizations have developed their own systems of formal logic, Greeks, Chinese and Indians, where all three independently formulated their own ideas, but even here Chinese logic faded away due to laws during Qin dynasty so they imported Buddhist logic from India so it was truly Indians and greeks who innovated in this field, according to Max Mueller \"  The sciences of Logic and Grammar were, as far as history allows us to judge, invented or originally conceived by two nations only, by Hindus and Greeks\". Paninian Grammar is oldest formal grammar which also anticipated backus naur form and some aspects of Boolean logic, Tholkappiyam also anticipated many developements in linguistics, but this is not the where it ends, both Buddhists and Jains contributed immensely,  [Catu·π£ko·π≠i - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catu%E1%B9%A3ko%E1%B9%ADi) logic for example by Nagarjuna anticipated many developments in paraconsistent logic and this was furthered by  [Jaina seven-valued logic - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaina_seven-valued_logic) , both Buddhists and Jains contributed immensely to Logic systems , While Nagarjuna did it in the south, in the north, Vasabhandhu, Dignaga and dharmakriti furthered it,  [Trair≈´pya - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trair%C5%ABpya) of Vasabhandhu was furthered by Dignaga who gave  [Hetucakra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetucakra) to further Vasabhandu's work and anticipates   John Stuart Mill's Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive. Both these buddhist logic systems spread to China where they could not understand it and did not develop logic at all. This isn't even the best of Indian Logic, the best comes from  [Navya-NyƒÅya - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navya-Ny%C4%81ya)  developed a sophisticated language and conceptual scheme that allowed it to raise, analyse, and solve problems in logic and epistemology. It systematised all the NyƒÅya concepts into four main categories: sense or perception (pratyak≈üa), inference (anumƒÅna), comparison or similarity upamana, and testimony (sound or word; ≈õabda).  This later school began around eastern[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India)India and Bengal, and developed theories resembling modern logic, such as Gottlog Frege's \"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\" and his \"definition of number,\" as well as the Navya-Nyaya theory of \"restrictive conditions for universals\" anticipating some of the developments in modern set theory. Udayana in particular developed theories on \"restrictive conditions for universals\" and \"infinite regress\" that anticipated aspects of modern set theory. In a letter to Mary Boole, she says that her husband George Boole, Augustus De Morgan and Charles Babbage got inspired from this school of Logic and this was something they heard about from George Everest. Hence you shouldn't be surprised when De Morgan said   \"The two races which have founded the mathematics, those of the [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) and Greek languages, have been the two which have independently formed systems of logic.\" , What are your thoughts, anything you like to add and anything you wish to contribute as there are about 44 million untranslated manuscripts.",
