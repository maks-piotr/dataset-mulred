    "selftext": "I ordered this [dumbbell set](https://amzn.in/d/2u41gy2) of 2 from Amazon on 29th May, 2024. It was delivered on 6th June. I immediately tested them item. One of the dumbbells was in perfect condition. It looked completely new. The other dumbbell however was so dirty and so scratches on it. It also got jammed when I was trying to adjust the weight. I initiated a return on that day was pick up request was created on ‚ÄúDelhivery‚Äù by Amazon. The pick up got delayed again and again so I contacted Amazon support and they created a new pick up request. Each new request is getting canceled in the Delhivery app. When I check with Delhivery, they say that the client canceled the pick up. But I never received a call from them. This happened back and forth for multiple pick up requests. Here are screenshots of some of the chat with the Amazon customer team.\n\nI called the Amazon customer service agent today and they created another pick up request on Monday. What are my options to get the refund if the pick up still gets canceled by Delhivery?\n",

        "First it's a common tactic by pickup guys as they want to avoid more loads.\n\nSecond After 3 consecutive pickups cancelled by the pickup guy, Amazon will initiate the refund of the amount. It's their policy, I got most of the amount refunded using this policy and they will arrange the pickup by themselves. You must arrange pickup by calling Amazon support.\n\nThird and most important: Even if you get the refund amount you should return the product by taking the initiative. Otherwise in your next return OFM or Account specialist will block your account for further order and whatever reason you give they don't reinstate your account.",
        "Yea they mentioned the second point when I called the agent today. But she said since the item has a ‚Äúhigh price‚Äù, she could not see an option for setting up advance refund. Not sure what to do if even after Monday it is not picked up. Whenever I call Amazon, their response is ‚ÄúLet me create a new pick up request‚Äù",
