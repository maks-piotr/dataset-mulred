I had opted for exchange after 7 days.( Got higher value and exchange later discount )\n\n2. New phone got delivered,\n\nThis delivery agent called and said server was down and can't be processed further.Old phone was not collected even after 10days and later the order got cancelled(seller had some difficulties).A problem from seller(or flipkart)\n\n3.I reached out to flipkart, they came up with solution that I can sell phone through Sell back program.\n\nGot Email from flipkart which had this condition :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/verzvgp](https://imgur.com/a/verzvgp)\n\n\\[\n\nIn case the Sell-back price for your old product is less than  the one you were getting as part of the Exchange later option, the  'difference amount' will be added as Gift Card within 24 hours after the  sellback pickup to your Flipkart account.\n\n\\]\n\nTo my suprise the Sell back program was cancelled twice.\n\nNow this sell back program estimated phone value to be 850(with same conditions display and body cracks acc to agent) I went ahead and sold it. As I had already got a reply from flipkart via email to match the price difference\n\n4. After all this hectic process of 20days. I have only received 850 in giftcard and now they are denying to match the price difference as stated earlier.\n\n1900 is less but still a good amount to fight back\n\nRaised 5 Complaints but they mark them as solved without proper resolution/email. \n\nCS is so terrible this lady started arguing lmao. I asked for a detailed reply though email also denied.\n\nThey are avoiding the previous mail and blaming on seller and old phone's state.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Never exchange your old phones online unless you are getting additional exchange bonus offer. Simply not worth it. Tried Flipkart and Cashify, they'll look so closely and find out minute flaws and immediately reduce the value of the phone. Better to sell it off yourself.",
        "I forgot to add, exchange later price(2750) is inclusive of  bonus of 1k",
        "It is becoming another Snapdeal",
        "I just want to ask one thing: Even after DOZENS AND DOZENS of these posts all over social media, why do people still keep using Flipkart? \n\nI'm not saying Amazon doesn't have its issues, but they are isolated and their support is usually pretty good.\n\nFlipkart is a pattern. Their entire business seems to be sucking out as much money from the customer as possible and spend little to no attention once the money is received by them.",
        "Just sell online on Facebook marketplace or OLX or whatever. These sellback programs are terrible anyway.\n\nLiterally got a defective Pixel 6a a few days ago, and if I see the listings for other phones, Flipkart is offering half the value of the Pixel 6a prices as exchange...........",
        "Because people don't have bad experiences, so they write it off as occasional issues faced by others. And then you get stung by the bad experience yourself and stop using them.",
