I wanted to highlight a few lesser know heroes who were murdered while opposing Mining Mafia in India.\n\n[**D.K. Ravi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._K._Ravi)\n\nHe was an IAS officer who did a crackdown against the encroachment of government lands and rampant illegal sand mining in the Kolar district of Karnataka. He also prepared a list of the top 50 tax defaulters and set a target of â‚¹1,000 crore in tax collection from the tax-evading defaulters, who were mostly powerful real estate developers and politicians. Also had collected over â‚¹138 crore tax in the first two weeks.\n\nHe was transferred from Kolar to Bangalore and was found hanging on March 16, 2015, after a short while.\n\n[**Sandeep Kothari**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sandeep_Kothari)\n\nHe was a freelance investigative crime journalist from Balaghat District, Madhya Pradesh. His reports exposed the sand mafia and illegal mining activities in Madhya Pradesh. He informed the police of the death threats he received. He also had 19 false accusations on record at various police stations.\n\nOn June 19, 2015, he was abducted, beaten, strangled, and then burned alive near a railway track in Butibori, Maharashtra.\n\n[**Surender Singh**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/haryana-dsp-murder-police-arrest-truck-driver-who-mowed-down-surender-singh/articleshow/93010394.cms)\n\nHe was a DSP in the Haryana police. He was investigating illegal stone mining in Haryana's Nuh district.\n\nOn July 19, 2023, he was mowed down by a truck when he went to stop illegal mining in the Aravalli Hills near Pachgaon, Haryana.\n\n[**Lourdhu Francis**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sand-mining-mafia-murder-village-administrative-officer-inside-his-office-in-thoothukudi-district/article66777090.ece)\n\nHe was Village Administrative Officer (VAO) of Murappanadu in Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu. He was informing the police and his higher-ups about the illegal sand miners operating in the area.\n\nOn April 25, 2023, he was hacked to death at his office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Many more people have gone down while fighting various Mining Mafia in India.
