    "selftext": "Nowadays  I see a lot of random brands of caffeinated drinks available at the  market for less than 50 rupees.  The cheapest is Rs. 20.  It is not  recommended for children and pregnant women.  Usually, these energy  drinks contain high amounts of caffeine which are not advisable for  adults to drink on a daily basis.  Children who can drink this regularly  can cause permanent damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system at a  young age.  But, I see kids casually buying 2-3 bottles of these drinks  from local shops.  The worst I saw was a father who bought this drink  for a kid under 5 years old.\n\nAlso,  nowadays lots of teens and adults are binge drinking alcohol with these  kinds of energy drinks.  There is a high chance that it  can cause permanent liver and kidney damage.\n\nSome references:\n\n(1) [https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks)\n\n(2) [https://twitter.com/theliverdr/status/1653763473552314368](https://twitter.com/theliverdr/status/1653763473552314368)\n\nThere is a compound in energy drinks called \"taurine\". There have been numerous studies on harmful effects of consuming taurine.  Coffee contains caffeine, but does not contain taurine.  Also consuming low amounts of consuming coffee, shows lots of health benefits according to some studies.\n\n(3) [https://driftaway.coffee/coffee-vs-red-bull/](https://driftaway.coffee/coffee-vs-red-bull/)\n\n(4) [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-taurine](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-taurine)\n\n(5) [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/is-coffee-good-or-bad-for-your-health/](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/is-coffee-good-or-bad-for-your-health/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s: I'm not a medical professional.
