        "I just completed The Bear on Hotstar. What an incredible show. The only way I can describe it is like Uncut Gems on Hotstar. Jeremy Allen White just kills it as the lead. 10/10 would recommend to everyone.\n\nWatching Vox Machina season 2, very very entertaining. I rarely have such fun watching non-anime  animated shows.\n\nSaw The Whale in cinemas this week. I was almost close to crying out loud at the end(I rarely cry at the movies ) Brendan Fraser gives a performance of his lifetime. It was such a great opportunity to watch him on the big screen.",
