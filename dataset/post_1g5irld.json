        "I've lived in North America for a bunch of years (thankfully) and it's crazy how the Indian society brainwashed children with conformism right from the beginning. I always felt this way. We used to stand in so called \"Morning assembly\" for 2 fucking hours in sweltering heat every morning sucking ass in the name of \"worshipping our country\" where we sang a bunch of bullshit posturing we love our country. Then we'd go to our classes and fight each other over trivial shit like what bench we'll sit on, call the fat teacher a hundred different names, gossip about the sisters of classmates and how we'll fuck them play by play, and laugh at the lower caste peon of the school. This is how we love our country.\n\nDon't get me wrong, posturing matters. As a society, we'd always observe our festivals, touch feet of the elders (not because we had a feet fetish), and side with India, not with the right thing, whenever India was dragged into foreign diplomatic issues. Because critical thought, freedom of expression and a moral compass individual of biases are non-starters in the Indian society. If you do not conform to the societal line (as opposed to the party line under the CCP in our neighbouring country), you are a terrorist or plain anti-India. You are not allowed to have an opinion that deviates from the groupthink and what the opinion of the groupthink is, is none of your business because that comes from higher up the chain of command - something that you can't ever comprehend, let alone question. Your job is to conform and repeat what the student on the stage says on the mic with 100% passion or you're not a true patriot.",

I mean yes we've gone to war with them, but a regular pakistani makes literally no difference to my life, or yours for that matter. by branding them as \"enemy\" , all we're doing is putting them in a pedestal. it wasn't them who colonised us for 200 years. And the British don't even make the cut? cmon this thinking is why we're always going to be backward in terms of foreign relations. America has a 100 enemies. yet they also have good political relations with most countries, if not all. South Asia has the potential to be a force to be reckoned with, and only China has managed to have that as a title. The Chinese have started making settlements illegally into Indian territory (in the last 10 years or so, which is quite recent) and they continue to expand. yet we still don't want to see them as much as an \"enemy\" because it would be extremely detrimental to the businesses in India. so we brand Pakistan, which , in all honesty, is not even at par with India on any front (except perhaps music), as an enemy state because its easier. its almost like a 6 foot person branding a 5'3 teenager as their enemy. you see how that looks like?",
        "An innocent Pakistani, Chinese or Canadian civilian does no harm to India. I am referring to their governments. The govt of pakistan's efforts are basically directed towards destabilising India since antiquity. China is also doing it, but we are in a difficult position vis-a-vis China since we also have a huge trade deficit. It is very easy to brand pakistan as an enemy but most Indian armed forces personnel fighting for India have died directly or indirectly due to Pakistan's actions",

Yet that particular embodiment has been made into a matter of contention. My objection is to the judge pronouncing an order without any framework and distorting a personal choice. An analogy that I can provide is the National Anthem and Sare Jahan Se Accha. One comes with a constitutional mandate to be respected. The other is just a popular patriotic song. Now if a judge were to pronounce singing that as some sort of loyalty reinforcement that is an issue. The point I am trying to make may seem technical but the larger point I am trying to make is incidents like police and goons beating up people and forcing chants of Bharat Mata Ki Jay. The court order strengthens the validity of such behavior. yeah it is not a law, but you know it is like supporting people who literally want to kill you and you want to align with them. It shows the character of a person who wants unsafety for the host nation, he deserves it. Doesn't hold true for India anymore, most of the people who actually paid the blood and tears are no more. Now patriotism is used only to rile up braindead people and shift focus away from things that really matter. you are telling in a way that, it is okay to support a traitor nation who literally wants to kill our people because it is not written in law? Like you are truly a fucked up individual, if you feel like supporting them, why live here? That is a completely different matter. Someone can only be prosecuted if they commit a crime, and he didn't commit a crime. Rest is just your opinion man >yeah it is not a law Then it's not a crime. It's so simple to understand. it is simple to understand to not support enemy countries who did terror attacks and to align your values to a country who want to end this country. Loyalty or patriotism can't be forced when you are being brainwashed since childhood. I'd say keeping an eye on these people is necessary. Now they're just chanting for Pak and next they'll help in a bomb blast somewhere in the country in the name of jihad. They are fed lies by their leaders from the very beginning and it's our government's failure that they couldn't stop that from happening even after 75 years of independence. But that's literally your opinion, not the law. Faizan! Of course. Who would've guessed My opinion, but also country's effort to stop that country. Damn I never felt this much love for pakistan in an indian subreddit. Lmao Also I'm not Pakistani. Your the one who want india to behave like pakistan. If you want barbaric laws you can go to pakistan Same as saying bharat mata ki jai in Philippines Estonia **≠** Pakistan His religion wont allow him to. No, I try to improve my country aswell, but more for the people than the country itself. To me it doesnt matter whether the people have the same or another citizenship than myself. Patriotism sounds more like brainwashing and a classic we against them mentality. Why should I care more about you than about a kid in Congo? Thats such a hilarious way of thinking buddy. You dont need a reason why theyre doing it. Do you think these millions of NRIs are getting kicked out of the countries for permanently showing their patriotism in public? And it has nothing to do whether your government has a friendly relation with another country or not. Have you ever heard of russians getting arrested in Germany for shouting this? Sure... that will teach him to love India Having to salute the indian flag is a punishment? Is this what we want, really? I feel so sad for your parents He shouldn't have been arrested in the first place. 👍 Why are we even reconciling with these people? Strip their citizenship off, send them to lahore, let them enjoy paying three times the price of aatta we pay Stupid take. There's quite a difference between nationalism and patriotism. Estonia didnt send terrorists here, did they? As annoying as pseudo patriotism is in this country, I much prefer it to anti natonalism, which this is an actual case of. Ohh..hey thanks for the award kind stranger. No way... This hopefully is recorded for proof I've lived in North America for a bunch of years (thankfully) and it's crazy how the Indian society brainwashed children with conformism right from the beginning. I always felt this way. We used to stand in so called \"Morning assembly\" for 2 fucking hours in sweltering heat every morning sucking ass in the name of \"worshipping our country\" where we sang a bunch of bullshit posturing we love our country. Then we'd go to our classes and fight each other over trivial shit like what bench we'll sit on, call the fat teacher a hundred different names, gossip about the sisters of classmates and how we'll fuck them play by play, and laugh at the lower caste peon of the school. This is how we love our country. Don't get me wrong, posturing matters. As a society, we'd always observe our festivals, touch feet of the elders (not because we had a feet fetish), and side with India, not with the right thing, whenever India was dragged into foreign diplomatic issues. Because critical thought, freedom of expression and a moral compass individual of biases are non-starters in the Indian society. If you do not conform to the societal line (as opposed to the party line under the CCP in our neighbouring country), you are a terrorist or plain anti-India. You are not allowed to have an opinion that deviates from the groupthink and what the opinion of the groupthink is, is none of your business because that comes from higher up the chain of command - something that you can't ever comprehend, let alone question. Your job is to conform and repeat what the student on the stage says on the mic with 100% passion or you're not a true patriot. No worries. India, China and Japan are society focused places while Europe, USA, Australia are individual focused places In the former, the most important thing is group harmony In the latter, its personal morality >In the former, the most important thing is group harmony You're the first person I've met who reduced conformism, hypocrisy, lack of civil etiquette and empty posturing to \"group harmony\". Good job. You agree? It's a democracy. He can say whatever he wants is there 'Bharat Mata' in our law ? Our courts are a fucking joke. I wish the man would appeal against this nonsensical decision lol! lol! will saying Canada zindabad have the same punishment, even though currently Indians rekations with Pakistan are better than what they are with Canada? Try it out and let me know 😂😂 on a serious note, Canada is not a historic or long term enemy. The current animosity is purely due to idiotic actions by Justin trudeau, so people will be indifferent to your chants. I would still rate our enemies as Pakistan > China > Canada 'Pakistan zindabad' to Tara ne bhi kaha tha. Our next door uncles were more accommodating that time than super progressive /india. Even if someone says India Murdabad, that should not be crime. He will be stupid/vile but not criminal. Sedition has no place in today's secular democratic country. Sedition is the tool for dictators. haha no thanks, I want to live 😅 What is enemy? I mean yes we've gone to war with them, but a regular pakistani makes literally no difference to my life, or yours for that matter. by branding them as \"enemy\" , all we're doing is putting them in a pedestal. it wasn't them who colonised us for 200 years. And the British don't even make the cut? cmon this thinking is why we're always going to be backward in terms of foreign relations. America has a 100 enemies. yet they also have good political relations with most countries, if not all. South Asia has the potential to be a force to be reckoned with, and only China has managed to have that as a title. The Chinese have started making settlements illegally into Indian territory (in the last 10 years or so, which is quite recent) and they continue to expand. yet we still don't want to see them as much as an \"enemy\" because it would be extremely detrimental to the businesses in India. so we brand Pakistan, which , in all honesty, is not even at par with India on any front (except perhaps music), as an enemy state because its easier. its almost like a 6 foot person branding a 5'3 teenager as their enemy. you see how that looks like? An innocent Pakistani, Chinese or Canadian civilian does no harm to India. I am referring to their governments. The govt of pakistan's efforts are basically directed towards destabilising India since antiquity. China is also doing it, but we are in a difficult position vis-a-vis China since we also have a huge trade deficit. It is very easy to brand pakistan as an enemy but most Indian armed forces personnel fighting for India have died directly or indirectly due to Pakistan's actions your only issue is \"mata\"? bro doesnt know what an allegory is..romantic nationalism is based on this stuff bruddah. European nations have theirs too, Germania, Marianne, Mother Albania etc."
