    "light_cleaned_title": "Just over 50% Indians have three meals a day",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I haven't had 3 meals for like 10+ years. I skip either breakfast or lunch. I have been skipping lunch for the last 2 years. I would eat lunch only when I am feeling exhausted or I am hungry. Eat less and live more. Whacko Out of touch response. Many people skip meals intentionally. The article never covered that response. This is called cherry picking. You are looking at things from the point that fits your agenda. Subhe chai ka sath muri biscuits dopaher ko aur saam ko aur bhi khana hota hai ky Accusing me of cherry picking but ignored the first paragraph in the article. Wah. I only eat two meals a day. This is soo dum and a fraudulent article. False Narratives 1. Three meals are healthy: Intermittent fasting says otherwise 2. Western outlook to 3 meals totally discounts Indian cultural practices . There are communities that only do two big meals. It's really hard to believe this. 50% of Indians can't afford meals 3 times a day? You are skipping breakfast/lunch because it's your choice. Most are skipping their breakfast/lunch because they have no other choice. Let them eat cake!! ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ç ‡§¨‡§®‡§®‡•á ‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡•§ A study says only 27% of Americans have the traditional 3 meals a day. Average person eats only 2 meals a day. How large was the sample set? Internet did not disappoint I don't think that 50% of Indians can't afford but half of them choose not to eat 3 meals. I have seen families skipping breakfast or dinner and believe in intermediate fasting. The majority of the population in India are poorer than you think. I skip breakfast, too, as part of intermittent fasting. But as a country as a whole, I really don't think even 1% is skipping a meal because of intermittent fasting. Mai afternoon me hi breakfast karta hu aur fir seedha dinner. 3 time khane ki zarurat hi nhi padti Maybe it's hard for me to believe because I am from Kerala, and in the graph it says more than 98% have 3 meals. Yeah. Farmers in village have heavy brunch and then dinner. Never take any health advice from Americans. The most obese people on the planet I usually skip breakfast just cos I don't feel like eating at that time of day Please make your food protein rich, we Indians don‚Äôt eat enough protein and suffer in latter stages of our life. Borgir Your title is Misleading I legit forget breakfast somedays. As a guy who skips breakfast, me uthta hi 12-1 baje hu i was the 50% in kota. 7 baje breakfast milti thi 10 baje uth ta tha. Many do eat snacks or other junk foods in between As someone who is originally from who has lived in other states, its not very hard for me to believe. Very few are as privileged as you are. if you have a sedentary lifestyle , eat 2 meals a day. u will never get fat. I have only 1 meal a day. Which is sufficient for complete day I dont think it's because of affordability, if thats the case, why is both rich and the poor having a similar percentage in almost all states. Very few in India have the kind of jobs that result in a sedantry lifestyle. me: 2 time khana 1 time daaru. What about all the IT jobs and desk jobs in other sectors? I might be wrong but i think this number might be a bit inflated pds and food security act, 2013 has worked well in the regardof food grain availability. There is a widespread distribution of foodgrains which might not be nutritious but it‚Äôs better than nothing. However this doesn‚Äôt mean that there is no scarcity of food but to say like a number that 50% indians which is approximately 70 crores do not have food might be an exaggeration. Same... I am following OMAD diet. Greatly improved my health. 3 meals are overrated Only 21.5% of Indians are currently estimated to even have regular salaried jobs. The share of Indians working in IT jobs and desk jobs would be even lower. Oldies are especially lacking in our country 3 meals a day is a British concepts we for during British raj. India never had a breakfast culture. Never take health advice from \"Average American\". Not everyone are obese btw. You should also note that 10% of their demographics are Indians. How do you explain the richest 20% of the top 5 States also not eating 3 meals a day? Poverty is one of the causal factors, but it alone doesn't dictate dietary habits. Drier regions typically eat lesser number of meals for various reasons. I know never and everyone should NEVER be used. my goal isn't to be technically correct here I always eat yogurt in the morning or make smoothies out of it, In India we really don‚Äôt have a good yogurt available. It saves time, high in protein and is really good for my gut. I wonder why people in India don‚Äôt consume yogurt much compared to Europe and West. By choice or without a choice? Poor nutrition is the problem more than number of meals. 80% Indians are protein deficient. Loading up on carbs, with a small amount of vegetables and negligible protein. Then the Western junk - cornflakes, cookies, bread, rusk which is empty carbs. Same But that is by choice, most people don't eat it because they can't afford it You are goals man. I reduced my means from 5 per day to 3. Hoping to go for 2. Do you do breakfast and dinner or something other combination? How did you transition from more than 2 to 2? Why did you start? even i miss breakfast way too many times. ig i should wake up before 2pm 10%? Just watched some video where dude said 6% of usa were Asians and 1.5% were Indian Americans Bruh, you do realise that yogurt is essentially hung curd? It's when you Remove excess water/liquid from dahi. The essential fermentation process is very very similar along with the product biotics post fermentation. Also, it's usually a bad idea to consume fermented food from the shelf. Take care. It is unbelievable how unhealthy our eating habits are, and how offended people get when you point it out. \"Dal\" is enough, some will assert. Even Bengalis, who are probably the heaviest meat eaters have a completely unbalanced diet, because despite eating enough protein, they eat so much carbs through rice and potatoes. Why? Are you on weight loss goals/program? Or maybe bcz they wake up late or are fussy eaters. My sister wakes up at 11 on noon school days. Ig it is more like they don't eat and less like they are forced to not eat I choose not to eat 3 meals a day‚Ä¶ The bacteria found in the yogurt and curd is completely different which is what makes yogurt different from curd. I don‚Äôt have time to make curd at home and especially the flavoured ones which we get without any added sugar. I love them and have been consuming them without any problem from last 7 years from the shelf and will continue to do so. Majority of us don‚Äôt have the time to make curd or milk the cow. Takecare :) Nope. I really do believe I don't need 3 meals. For the longest time I have been eating breakfast, lunch, snacks dinner and then a lite snack. I want to understand if I really need that much. Skipped the mid night stuff. Didn't notice a difference. Then skipped the evening snacks. Again, no difference. Been testing a plan where my meals are 3 and weekly skip a sing meal for the past 3 months. No difference at all. The entire concept of 3 meals I feel is flawed. It was designed to increase productivity at factories for the workers. Again, it's all exploratory rn. No reasearch backed. Just want to understand my body better. I sometimes eat only one meal a day, by choice. Autophagy. The stats are convoluted. USA's immigration laws were pathetic so they technically don't have updated data. Abbe Rural me wo Lunch hi agr 11 baje kar rhe hai, to kyu hi breakfast krengeü´† Been going to my village(both, mom n dad side)since ages but, never have I ever seen a concept of breakfast(unless n until any occasion demands like guest, function n so on) From dinner's pov, it's done by 7-7:30PM Between those 7-8 hrs, most of them do have some light snacks(especially good amount of tea at 3-4pm) Why do Indians need meals? They can chant \"Modi Modi\" to satisfy their hungres. Angen gatram, lode bhojanam. - Modi to all hungry Indians. some people need to do that tho Number of meals per day is an absolutely ineffective metric to quantify the health of a nation -- there are so many cultural, environmental, and ecological reasons that dictate dietary habits. A better method would be to calculate the caloric intake and output, and quantify the kind of essential nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbs, proteins, and fat) that a person/family is consuming. I have been on omad for half a year now. Mess mei breakfast khatam hone ke baad soke uthta hu toh miss hoga hiü•≤ Strawberry? I haven‚Äôt come across single good yogurt brand in India yet. I think OP meant to say only over 50% of the people can afford to eat 3 meals a day and everything bad with India is just labelled as a British or foreign concept by y'all. Work life balance, weekends, having fun, sure these are foreign concepts but that doesn't mean we shouldn't follow them, they lead to a good and happy life. Here fuckers like Infosys ka Narayan Murthy and OLA, CEO Bhavesh promote shit like 70 hour work week, 100 hour work week, no work life balance, no weekends. Sure I'd work 70-100 hours but for my own self, for my own company. Those people earn millions of dollars for their work and they wanna pay employees for 40 hours of work and expect them to work for 70-100 hours in the name of nationalism and growing India. My Grand parents, parents everybody ate 3 meals a day . Why would I want to change it . I do believe in this report bcz I used to assume that we are middle class then I knew about caste and income then I realised we are actually working class. Most of indians are working class and below. I once visited a temple where we had to wait before opening gate there I saw people from different states those who belong to rich family are quiet easy to spot But people in India already consume a lot of curd, is yogurt wayy better than curd? Villagers mostly eat only two times. Heavy brunch and heavy dinner. In between tea & milk. I find yogurt texture and consistency way better than curd, I make multiple meals out of yogurt compared to curd. We get flavoured yogurts as well ( I consume without any added sugar) which helps my sugar craving go away and is also a tastier alternative. Yogurts have double the amount of protein. Very less percentage of people work in that job . Do you get enough protein ? I don't think omad is sustainable for long term . Right, but I would bet a sizeable chunk of people in that 50% usually skip one meal a day not because of financial condition, but because of choice Same here, lunch around 11 am then dinner at 8pm. Breakfast karne ka mann hi ni karta kabhi. Aur jis din kar leta hu to lunch ka schedule bigad jata hai. What is it? Lol me, but it's because I don't feel like it when I'm going out. I eat when I stay home. Pg only provides 2 meals That's not how you lose weight. Reduce your potion size and take the stairs instead of the elevator. Reducing the frequency of meals makes your body store more of the carbs and fats. Tamilnadu is Top becos of our Free Mid day meals. Very proud ‚ù§Ô∏è.. 3 is too much anyways. I feel full enough just by 2 meals itself and some exercise is optimal for the body imo If the richest 20% aren't that different from poorest 20%, then the analysis needs to be based on cultural practices or work related issues rather than portraying it as a poverty issue. Like, Delhi - poorest 20% - 55.2% richest 20- 35.2% chattisgarh - poorest 20% - 60.2% richest 20% - 36.5% Haryana - poorest 20% - 60.3% 20-40% - 78% richest - 82.7% Telangana - poorest 20% - 94.8% 20-40% - 84% Rural regions have higher portion of 3 meals a days. The important statistic is increase in difference between poor and richest. It is 11% in 2024, it was 3.5 in 2011-12. Overall, 3 meals a day don't mean proper nutrition. Guess what. Even Medicine is a British concept. Before that we Indians used to die from polio.. no they dont, bottom 50% of india makes less than 15k a month, it's not by choice. I don‚Äôt do manual labor or heavy workout, and eating very early in the day makes me feel uneasy. I‚Äôm not following any diet plan or intermittent fasting; I just prefer to eat only when I‚Äôm actually hungry. cmon usa doesnt have 10% indians 3 crore Indians in USA, that does not seem possible. 1.5% seems correct, around 45 lakh Indians. I also skip breakfast not because of poverty, i just wake up at 10 What a depressing infographic. richest 20% in many of those poor states arent really that rich, keep in mind top 10% monthly income in india is close to 25k, and those BIMARU states and other states with poorer pops top 20% arent actually that rich Doesn't everyone have free midday meals? >Work life balance, weekends, having fun No these are not the foreign concepts z it's the basic human needs. We don't live to work. We work to live. I agree the OP meant to say that we can't even afford the food and that's the real point. Having only 2 meals is not the actual problem and üö≠ a good way to surface the underlying problem One Meal A Day (OMAD). Not for everyone, obviously. They do not. Most people skip meals because they can't afford it. Over 32% kids under 5 years are considered underweight. This is not because they are choosing to skip a meal. It's because parents can't afford to feed their kids. Half the college kids miss breakfast. I don't know. but heard hindi states don't give eggs in mid day meal schemes becoz it's against their vegetarian diet. Tamilnadu even have started Free breaks fast scheme from previous year. May be That is also a reason. Child nutrition deficiency is lower in both Kerala and Tamilnadu.. but if you have 2 meals a day you are rich and out of poverty :) Been doing it since COVID. No problem. Of course, I eat a lot of protein and fiber. No refined flour, very little sugar. Workout in the evenings - then a big dinner. Thats it. In brief can you provide some inside? Like weight etc and what meal include what and how does it impact your health. And why did you decide omad? Thnx. Reasons can absolutely vary. And 50% of Indians can't afford 3 meals a day is something that's not true tbh. Well, my blood tests about 6 years back were pretty bad. Working out wasnt making a difference. I am a big guy - 6'3 weighed about 104 kgs. Decided to cut out most carbs and follow OMAD. I dont eat simple carbs. I eat lot of chana, beans, dal, kabuli chana etc. Then nuts - almonds and peanuts and walnuts. Vegetables which are not overly carb heavy - like Cucumber, Tindey etc. and about 150 gms of Chicken, fish or mutton. This meal fills you up for 24 hours as its high in protein and fiber. I avoid sugar as much as possible. Workout for an hour- weight and cardio. My weight has dropped to 81 and my blood tests are now normal and my overall health is now brilliant. Skip breakfast if you're younger than 50. Now we know the root cause of Gujarat Model. That's great . Eating 2000-2500 calories in one sitting seems big to me. I try the same too i only eat some moong chat sort of thing at night and one meal in the morning Even without counting you and people like you who choose to skip one meal; \"2 And the share of people who have three meals increases among the rich.\" says something. Well, its not for everyone. Suits me though, and saves time. I stay alone and dont want to waste time cooking three meals. I dont like junk food and I dont like hotel food. I'm a one meal a day person. Looking at the comments section - I would say this may not be such a bad thing. If you were eating 3 meals earlier, better to continue the routine. I was eating 3 meals till I was 29 and then reduced it to 2 meals thinking it was fine and in 2 years, I got gastritis. Please don't fuck up your stomach. That's the worst feeling ever. Much wider gap between states than economic sections. Yes some states are richer than others but no state‚Äôs 20%ile is richer than another state‚Äôs 80%ile. Makes this seem more like a result of culture than economics Skipping breakfast works for me. At first I was a bit hungry, so started drinking just a smoothie or ragi mslt with curd for breakfast. Then I slowly started reducing the quantify for a few days and then started not eating breakfast. Not much of a difference for me as long as eat lunch in time before 2. Honey Singh once said, \" Chaar Botal Vodka, Kaam Mera Roj Ka\" so do you want to starve those poor fat and rich souls, you have no heart ü•π CICO is nearly universally agreed and proven method of reducing weight. You only burn a few hundred calories maximum with high intensity exercise, and even then after a few months your joy adapts to the exercise and stops burning alot of calories. The only good way if burning calories is reducing consuming it. And one of the good method to reduce it is by intermittent fasting which many have tried and tested it. And I didn't see anyone talking about increasing time between meals increases fat storage with intermittent fasting. This isn‚Äôt about the chunk of population that‚Äôs trying to diet or doesn‚Äôt have time to eat breakfast. It‚Äôs about the part of the population that can‚Äôt afford it. I should never forget I'm blessed I don't like eating that early in the day, I'd much rather have a heavy lunch Same. Though this is not by choice. I just have a very bad sleep schedule. Ambani: Great. I am engineering college student in Bengaluru and our college starts at 9 am,so 60-70% of friends skip breakfast. Because they have to save time to compensate it for traffic I think in my state chhattisgarh, people don't eat 3 time is more of choice than about poverty. I know why it's considered misinformation because the stats say 1.6%. Those stats will never get updated is what I'm saying. Indians are amazing at data manipulation. Just look up for unauthorised immigrants in USA. That underweight problem is not because they are eating less it's about they are eating less protein rich food. Poor people can't afford nutritional food. They will eat carb 3 times but they will still underweight I do 2 meals a day lol. Guys, If you want to eat twice, skip dinner instead of breakfast, i see many people in the comment section tell that they skip breakfast. There is a quote \" Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a middle class person and dinner like poor \" I have two meals a day 10 years of messaging like Acche Din, Amrit Kaal, smart cities, bullet trains and vikas has programmed Indians into thinking sab changa si. The reality couldn‚Äôt be further from that. You can‚Äôt blame people for falling for that propaganda though. Nobody has been lied to as frequently and as effectively and at such scale as Indians in the last 10 years ‚Äî and they‚Äôve been lied to by the very people who‚Äôre supposed to speak the truth. I only eat 2 meals, on rare occasions I eat dinner. Still diabetes and hypertension is a big distrupter in our life due to wrong eating habits.. Eating less won't take us anywhere, eating right will. I avoid breakfast. So I guess I too fall in this I see. Can you please share some sources that also claim that both are complete seperate from a bacterial point of view, fermentation point of view and preperation point of view? Would love to read about them. Here you go A lot of this could be attributed to the local culture and habits. Doesn't seem like there's any correlation to the Monthly per capita here. Just by comparing the poorest and richest within each state, they look very similar for every state. Except Jharkhand, Haryana and Karnataka, where the difference in people having 3 meals is 10+% less for poorest. The rest are DOING forced IMF. I eat less during üåô Did they work office jobs or physical jobs? In my entire life I never felt hungry waking up. I only ever eat breakfast when it's included with my hotel room so I force myself a bit. I mean I only eat 2 meals üôÉ Today only one meal,lol feeling hungry Wrong information The Pacific island nations of Nauru, Cook Islands, and Palau have the highest rates of obesity USA comes 10th obese in the list Here people are just throwing random statements like ‚ÄúUSA is the most obese country‚Äù It‚Äôs a wrong statement Also, some here immediately point to USA and find some mistake in their country to justify poor conditions here Classic! When they‚Äôre an issues pointed out, quickly finding some fault in a western country This study doesn't tell anything about affordability. Majority of Americans only eat 2 meals a day. There needs to be better surveys, that capture the nutritional content of the meal than number of times. I eat 1 meal a day, doesn't mean I am poor. Yup. I see that Tamil Nadu has 98%+ of people who eat 3 meals a day. I can say with full confidence that nearly everybody here in TN are ADDICTED to carbs. Do you know how many people I have come across who say they are \"starving\" because they ate the breakfast/lunch/dinner late? You don't \"starve\" when you miss a meal. Only people with carb addiction need constant supply of carbs to stop hunger pangs. And do you know how a majority of people here eat like 500-600 GRAMS of rice as lunch when they eat in restaurants? Almost all the restaurants here proudly proclaim their \"veg/non veg meals\" as unlimited (called as thali in north) This is not UPSC prelims Similar for MH. MH society is brutal towards people who over eat...... This only tells me that Western states (MH, GJ and RJ) eat less than 3 meals a day irrespective of their financial background. And that South Indian states (Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala) eat 3 meals a day irrespective of their financial background. This is also the reason why MH and GJ has less obesity compared to TN and Kerala."
