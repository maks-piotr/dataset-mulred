Back in August, I was fined for overspeeding and received *multiple challans* for the **same day** I paid two challans immediately, thinking that was the end of it.\n\nFast forward to December, and I’m now receiving **new challans with different timestamps** for that same day. It feels like they’re splitting hairs to fine me repeatedly for the same offense. At this rate, I’m half expecting them to start issuing fines for every single minute I was driving!\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Can they legally issue multiple challans for the **same date and offense**?\n\n1. Why am I receiving these months later, despite having already paid?\n2. What’s the best way to resolve this? So far, I’ve tried contacting the authorities, but their responses are vague and haven’t helped.\n\nI admit to overspeeding and have already paid the fines, but this just seems excessive and unfair. Has anyone else faced a similar issue? What steps can I take to fight this or at least make sense of it?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance or advice!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/riskua73466e1.png?width=1972&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b2e299fb10aee5a6d0c141e0f4e4ef39ad4889c\n\n  \n",
