Fir bahut saal mute rakhne ke baad, finally exit kar gaya groups se 2018-19 me. Kisi ne wapas add bhi nahi kiya.\n\nBut, have you noticed these bhakts just want to get some reaction out of you. Unki training yahi hai ki samne wale ko provoke karo. Iske 2 results ho sakte hain:\n\n1. If a person agrees with you and praises Modi/BJP/Hindoo Kulcha, then you know you have found an ally. Aise logo ko community ka part bana kar unse WhatsApp University ki inside info share kar sakte hain. Logo par coordinated attacks me bhi use kar sakte hain.\n\n\n2. If a person disagrees, uses logic, starts abusing Modi/BJP or fact checks your message, then they are the person you need to work on. Disagreement is the first sign of interest. Agar wo interested hain to unko brainwash bhi kiya ja sakta hai fake news bombard kar ke. Fir kuch saal propoganda sun ke unke andar ka Hindu jaag jayega and they will turn into useful contributors to the society, aka BJP voters.\n\nLekin agar Hindu jagaane ki baatein kar rahe hain WhatsApp University graduates aur saamne wala sota rahe to it's the biggest defeat you can give them. Ignorance is the best reply, it confuses them to no end, like, ye to out of syllabus ho gaya. Ab kya karein, WhatsApp University me to padhaya hi nahi jata ignorance ka jawab.",

Hail hindu protector modi -100 Schrute bucks r/theunkillnetwork honestly thought that was the xbox logo on the wooden plank. and someone said the same thing below. Lol where tf did UNICEF come from...do you mean UNESCO? Bcoz it's a great nation thats why It would be scary if it was true actually. Imagine such a large corporation in cohorts with the govnm, what it would be receiving in illicit favors. Does no one do any critical thinking anymore? No no, you see that's why our brilliant Indian 🇮🇳💪 engineers have built a second building right next to it so the satellite will get confused. /s if not clear. So , you mean, like a bribe ? The biggest. Some say the most beautiful. Do you think these people ever remove the balls of these politicians from their mouths! The opposition seat nows are now eject-able with the buttons near supreme leaders chair. Is it already a heritage? Just like Currency note is a piece of paper, so is constitution. Its value comes from the people's belief in it and how well its enforced and held to in regard. Bruh And the best national anthem declared by UNESCO Why is he always photo ready in these pictures!! Candid photo khichwa rahe bhai 1 Stanley dollar is 10,000 Schrute bucks, choose wisely. Hahahaha I miss receiving such crap. If not sai baba will note you down. Damn I needed this! Thank you That's what rahul Gandhi will handout😂 Whatever design is going on in the repeated pattern towards the top of the seats definitely looks like they copied the Xbox logo. Cheap internet is one of the worst things to have happened lol. There was nothing wrong with old .tax payer money at work yet people sleep hungry and no jobs Modi hai sab mumkin hai The political urge to tell the first lie from this parliament is irresistible Best comment ever > Actually- we do have a well thought out constitution. We really don't - Try reading it. There's crap about the use of handcuffs by police and even salaries of government officials in there, it's a total mess. It's laughably long and not even a real constitution, the Supreme Court can make amendments however they want, meaning it's subservient to the law, not a set of rules that binds the government and the law. This is what New Parliament House looks like from space on Diwali Night :) This is true, i can verify by my family group Thus tells me you have not read it. Dr. Ambedkar said that right then - it depends on how good or bad the people handling it is on going to be. We have over the years (I don't mean you or me) allowed low quality people into the Parliament or rather allowed even some high quality people, but stopped to ask accountability of them Democracy is hard work people - it's not like citizens role stop when votes are done. You need to be actively political in democracies. The chief engineer for the project said in an interview that he was stuck in a huge problem a while back, no solution could be found in the civil engineering books. When Modi ji came to know about this, he called the engineer and provided a solution from vaastu and other hindu scriptures. After that only he could proceed with the construction. Namo namo Which means that all the new bank notes that are hidden in the parliament are untraceable by satellites. And black money can be safely parked there. It's all drama. I know how it feels. This is the reason I hate sitting with my uncles or other family members when they are discussing politics. I have had so many arguments with my father that how he is blindly supporting someone without even knowing facts. I left the family WhatsApp group making excuses like it disturbs me when i am at work or studying. Almost have most relatives muted on fb. It's a peaceful world NGL. Yes. That's why the Supreme Leader didn't award this contract to Adani. Let me send this to my uncle real quick Mother of democracy Now the same will be vetted by ministry of truth ( ref 1984) IT cell doing the hard work. ye to 2020 se he ban rha hai na .... maybe jab se 17 month hue tab se he forward idhar se udhar ho rha hai Holy shit. Does anyone have the uncensored ? Modi khud hi satellite hai No shit That MLA is wild lol Kabhi yeh boldo ki Tax payers money hai..kabhi yeh ki India abhi bhi British parliament use krta hai shitty colonial mindset yaaaar..Bc banaye to dikkat nahi banaye to dikkat..Reddit use krle sab tere tarh Hain chindi?👽 Xbox sponsered parliament 💀 Ayo. That's some next level brain washing. I'm just afraid where it'll take in next few years. Bro imo you should let them cut ties.if your relationship can't handle a difference in political opinion it was never worth having to begin with. Then again family is family so think carefully about what you'd like to do It looked like he was using some kind of TikTok like app that has a swipe up feature. You sure it's porn? 🤨 What a joke by Godi media it costed 9000 crore. Do you think only material cost this much. Launch him in orbit please 🙏🏻 TATA is a publicly traded company. Why would they piss off their shareholders? Good riddance bro 😀 Yes...pls..aliens will not be able to enter India..Modi will kill Aliens and save the day once again. Aj kal /s include karna mandate ho gaya he bro...kya pata kon kya man leta he..😭😭😭 You can. Just start a cult. We will built Kailash 2.0 💪...kon kon hindu sher mere sath ho.../s Yeah bro...I actually decided from that day onward never to discuss politics with anyone within the family...my aunt is not a bad person per se..she is very enthusiastic about charity and has hosted us many times when we have gone to visit her in Mumbai...but when did this brainwashing started I have no idea..she used to alright...now all the time she talks only how India must reduce its Muslim population and that Hindu ratsra stuff..this is frankly annoying. I think this is the case with many housewives... they get their news from whatsapp and then get enraged against all sort of fake narratives. Everything \"Forwarded\" in WhatsApp is NOT TRUE. Both the above Stated myths are False. 1. It's estimated that the cost paid by the Government is around 1250 Crores. TATA won the tender with a bid of 861.91C. The official statement however states that the est costs is 971C. 2. The New Parliament took longer than just 17mon. It's not inaugurated nor opened yet. Xvideos. so ministers can watch porn while in the parliament I have a friend who told me so many times that Bengali has been declared as the sweetest language in the world that I started to doubt myself. And in the end he said he got the information from a whatsapp forward. Bruh this is why I always leave family WhatsApp groups whenever anyone of my family members adds me. So what's the actual news? This is so 2014. Log aaj bhi aisa hi sochte hain kya? Mere immediate family members to Modi haters hain to koi problem nahi. Fir 2014-15 me nai nai WhatsApp University open hui thi to extended family ke 3-4 groups ban gaye. Log parents se chugli karte ki aapke bachhe to respond hi nahi karte, to wo log hass ke taal dete. Fir bahut saal mute rakhne ke baad, finally exit kar gaya groups se 2018-19 me. Kisi ne wapas add bhi nahi kiya. But, have you noticed these bhakts just want to get some reaction out of you. Unki training yahi hai ki samne wale ko provoke karo. Iske 2 results ho sakte hain: 1. If a person agrees with you and praises Modi/BJP/Hindoo Kulcha, then you know you have found an ally. Aise logo ko community ka part bana kar unse WhatsApp University ki inside info share kar sakte hain. Logo par coordinated attacks me bhi use kar sakte hain. 2. If a person disagrees, uses logic, starts abusing Modi/BJP or fact checks your message, then they are the person you need to work on. Disagreement is the first sign of interest. Agar wo interested hain to unko brainwash bhi kiya ja sakta hai fake news bombard kar ke. Fir kuch saal propoganda sun ke unke andar ka Hindu jaag jayega and they will turn into useful contributors to the society, aka BJP voters. Lekin agar Hindu jagaane ki baatein kar rahe hain WhatsApp University graduates aur saamne wala sota rahe to it's the biggest defeat you can give them. Ignorance is the best reply, it confuses them to no end, like, ye to out of syllabus ho gaya. Ab kya karein, WhatsApp University me to padhaya hi nahi jata ignorance ka jawab. Modi's permanent house. What do you mean “was built” it’s not yet completed, you see Modi with protective gear/ safety helmet? Construction is ongoing. Also TATA is a publicly traded company. They can’t and won’t do it for free. They will have to answer to all share holders. Including you and me if we had purchased their shares. And it’s illogical. They won’t have that kind of loose cash for a single project, even loans are given out on commercial viability. So not even possible. By Guinness Book of World records Aaj ka maal jo maine khaandani wtsapp group par bheja😝 After this I can say that I not the only one who is suffering from this things thanks dude🥲 I will join you if you make me president of your party Nice nice ...maine ye gaana diya Ab 23 ka ho gaya hun..riste aane wale hein mere..😎😏 Nasa declared that the parliament is visible from space and un declared that the kohinoor is stored in this parliament. Didn't these guys ban pornhub??...sala VPN use karna pad raha he inke liye.!! ...sale khud dekhenge hame nai dekhne denge.😒😒 Didn't these guys ban porn?? Hume dekne nai dekhenge khud dekenge..😒😒😒 Sarcasm... 😂 Woh zameen mein 2 km ki geherai tak kala dhan ko dhoond ke nikalega Looks like you can't read...no one has any problem with the new parliament...it's the stupid fake news spreading by your Supreme leaders party..about Tata doing it for free...and in 17 months ..both are false..whether they build a new parliament or not..I don't give a damn...that's their decision.thats why they have been elected to take decision on our behalf..but atleast don't give us bullshit when you use our fuckin money but credit some muthafucka capitalist...peace out. True. There is polarization on every level of the diaspora. Most of them believe the false narrative that they are under threat Humans are such proud creatures..when we come to believe something..it becomes a ego issue..even if later our pov is proved wrong...we just want to defend our intelligence...humans are weird. Why that 1, rupee though? r/unexpectedoffice He is a sound engineer also. Marshall was invented because of PM Awaaz Yojana Xbox by ModiSoft Then my Bank account will be in negative.🫠🫠🫠 I would actually create something like this in Canvas with proper logos and forward it again.. hahaha. In response to the original pic Baal Vivah 🗿 Personal cameraman Sigma Octagigahexalianiare Grindset 🗿🍷 I hope modi ji get his manrega money whatsapp is way more credible than any other source of info these days :) Insert metal pipe here It is a monstrosity and destroys the architectural style of the original building this. 1 rupee is a very small amount but in legal technicalities it makes a lot of difference. No business house does so much of charity, nor it is possible for tbem even if they want.Because every listed company is accountable to their shareholders at the end of the day. One individual might show charity. That too normally there is give and take. I and you won't be able to know what's the deal Don't you know that he build the entire parliament brick by brick /s 3 The construction worker looks like Modiji. Because Tata cloned Modiji genes because they wanted someone who can work 43 hours a day. Only one person in the whole world can do that. hari om. Under Congress govt, parliament was in rank 100. Now it is number 1."
