I already paid 15k above for this purchase. Now i have to pay . Is this customs?  How can i solve this issue? The post office officials say that it‚Äôs to be sent for revaluation and let‚Äôs see. Also there‚Äôs no bill attached to the parcel. Is it because of that ? If i show the bill to the officials, can i not pay the 8k rupees? Please give me a solution.",
