        ">The five judge Bench of the Supreme Court on May 11 did not decide on the disqualification petitions filed by former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and said, “This court cannot ordinarily adjudicate petitions for disqualification under the 10th Schedule [disqualification on the ground of defection] in the first instance. There are no extraordinary circumstances in the instant case that warrant the exercise of jurisdiction by this court to adjudicate disqualification petitions. The Speaker must decide disqualification petitions within a reasonable period.”\n\n>As for the recognition of Sunil Prabhu, who was originally appointed as the Chief Whip by the Shiv Sena party, the experts have opined that Mr. Narwekar must disqualify the 16 MLAs who violated the whip issued by Mr. Prabhu. P.D.T. Achary, former Secretary-General of the Lok Sabha, said, “The Speaker has no other option except to disqualify the MLAs from the Shinde faction. Because the Supreme Court has said that the whip can be issued by the political party, i.e. party headed by Uddhav Thackeray. This means the Shinde faction which defied the whip, so naturally they are liable to be disqualified.”\n\n>Nikhil Wagle, political analyst and author, said, “The Supreme Court has categorically said the selection of the whip is illegal, then the entire process is illegal, so the Speaker doesn’t have much option. But Mr. Narwekar is openly partial, so I think he will delay the process and finally give a verdict, where Mr. Thackeray will have to go to Supreme Court once again.”",
