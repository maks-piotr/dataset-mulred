    "selftext": "Dear friends from India, I am Brazilian and I would like to share with you a subject that is being talked about a lot here on social media in Brazil, a video of the G20 meeting, which took place in your country, which captures our president (a corrupt and ex-convict Lula) allegedly stealing pens after the event, together with his wife's complicity.  I would like you to tell me if it makes sense, and if the body language of both President Lula and his wife are in fact those of two people who are committing a crime.  And I would like to ask if anyone can tell me what type of pen was used at the G20 in India.  Whether they are luxury pens or not.  And let me tell you why this is important, because among several scandals that the current president of my country was involved in, a few months ago, during his inauguration, a controversy arose with a Montblanc pen that he couldn't explain the origin of, so it's clear that the corrupt Lula likes expensive and luxurious things, at the expense of the tax payer.
