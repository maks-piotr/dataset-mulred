The kid who was released even before the bodies of victims were cremated by theirÂ [families](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/pune-porsche-car-accident-victim-aneesh-awdhiya-mother-savita-justice-minor-punishment). Then there were attempts to sabotage the evidences and bail conditions which became a field day for memes.\n\nBut then we got new things to talk about. The Ambani weddings, the Olympics and what not.\n\nHere are some recent articles on what happened after the internet forgot:\n\n1.

Maharashtra Women and Child Development Panel recommends actions against JJB members (people who gave bail and bail conditions) for lapses in procedures -Â [The Hindu Article](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra/porsche-crash-wcd-panel-recommends-action-against-jjb-members-for-procedural-lapses-in-bail-to-minor/article68413896.ece)\n\nBy the time the order of any judicial authority comes, the internet would have forgotten, as always. Most people who wrote full length essays on twitter and \"10 things to learn from Pune Crash\" on LinkedIn wont even bother to know what happened after. If the internet had not pressured the local authorities to act, who knows if the case even made it out of Pune, let alone a national issue.",
