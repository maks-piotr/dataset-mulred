I am trying to pay through my Pakistani Bank, they generated an OTP but when proceeded the payment gets declined. I tried doing it twice.\n\nIs this because the card belongs to a Pakistani Bank? Or is there some other kind of issue? You can see in the fourth picture that I have enough funds in my bank to process the payment.\n\nPlease help me with this situation and suggest me how can I get the gifts delivered to her?\n\nThankyou",
