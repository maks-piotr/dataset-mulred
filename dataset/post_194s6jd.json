        "WHAT!!! By watching porn you are creating demand for child porn? Is that not straight forward?",
        "> Justice Anand Venkatesh noted that to attract the offences under the POCSO Act, a child or children must have been used for pornography purposes.\n\nI don't understand this decision.it sounds like only producing CP is a crime (what else would \"using a child\" mean).

If such a dvd were thrown over the wall of my compound Iâ€™d report it immediately so the one who threw it (and this had it in their possession) could be investigated. Iâ€™d find it highly suspicious if someone did not report such material immediately.  If youâ€™re unaware that itâ€™s there and the person who threw it reported it immediately then you would have more than enough grounds for reasonable doubt to have the case dismissed (if it even got that far) and the obvious question would be â€˜why did the person reporting it know it was there?â€™\n\nPossession of child abuse material is an absolutely reprehensible and violent crime. I find it staggering that someone would argue otherwise. Such material exists because there are people who want to possess it therefore they hold just as much guilt for itâ€™s existence",

Each time those videos/images are viewed itâ€™s another assault on those victims. Itâ€™s honestly staggering to me that anyone could argue that it should not be illegal to download and possess such images.

You have zero control on what for downloaded but you did.\n\nNo one is arguing that it's okay to make or spread cp.

        "Possessing a child will be sure an offence. Possessing photo/video of weed isn't a offence..\n\nNo supporting CP but your logic/example is flawed fo this case.",
        "Not an Indian lawyer, but Aussie chiming in. We use the phrase CSAM here, which stands for Child Sexual Abuse Material. It includes anything that represents a minor in a sexual way basically, so drawn images are included in the category of CSAM. There was a big hubbub about this specifically in relation to hentai a while back. In the USA, however, there was a case that I believe involved a drawing of Lisa Simpson that set a precedent excluding drawn content.\n\n\n\nFrom a psychological point of view, accessing this sort of material could encourage an individual to continue indulging in thoughts that normalise the perception of children in a sexual way. I know that's a slippery slope fallacy to an extent but there's evidence to support that it's a part of how we think. The issue with AI gen is that there could be real CSAM being used to train an AI to create images. It is also likely far more realistic than what an artist would make themselves, which further exacerbates the psychological issue above.\n\n\n\nLastly, chiming in as a person of Indian birth, it's clear that in such a populous country with such a profound wealth divide it is easy to exploit vulnerable people, which of course includes children. I firmly believe that there is an inherent element to pedophilia, and that some people are either born that way or predisposed to develop those tendencies. Unfortunately, their sexual desires cannot be acted upon without harming others, although I'm sure many people like this do not act upon their urges as they are also conscious it is going to harm a child irreparably. A certain percentage of the population are therefore, definitely inclined to view children in a sexual way and making it both harder and riskier to access content that might take someone who otherwise wouldn't offend over the edge is necessary. \n\n\nAs a quick addendum, I also think confidential therapy for people who find themselves attracted to children is also essential, but many other nations with a more progressive national view of mental health issues struggle with this so I don't see it as a realistic short or mid term goal for India (or even Australia).",

Weed and cannabis shouldn't be an offense. Internet is a pandoras box. You can't control ot. Brah you keep using the word \"download\" without realizing that in p2p transactions when someone sends you something, you download it.Those good morning messages you get from your relatives, downloaded. So if someone sends you explicit material, you downloaded it. You watch insta shorts or YT reels? You downloaded them all. You have zero control on what for downloaded but you did. No one is arguing that it's okay to make or spread cp. But possession based on downloading is pretty dumb and is regularly abused by those in power ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤® Possessing a child will be sure an offence. Possessing photo/video of weed isn't a offence.. No supporting CP but your logic/example is flawed fo this case. Not an Indian lawyer, but Aussie chiming in. We use the phrase CSAM here, which stands for Child Sexual Abuse Material. It includes anything that represents a minor in a sexual way basically, so drawn images are included in the category of CSAM. There was a big hubbub about this specifically in relation to hentai a while back. In the USA, however, there was a case that I believe involved a drawing of Lisa Simpson that set a precedent excluding drawn content. From a psychological point of view, accessing this sort of material could encourage an individual to continue indulging in thoughts that normalise the perception of children in a sexual way. I know that's a slippery slope fallacy to an extent but there's evidence to support that it's a part of how we think. The issue with AI gen is that there could be real CSAM being used to train an AI to create images. It is also likely far more realistic than what an artist would make themselves, which further exacerbates the psychological issue above. Lastly, chiming in as a person of Indian birth, it's clear that in such a populous country with such a profound wealth divide it is easy to exploit vulnerable people, which of course includes children. I firmly believe that there is an inherent element to pedophilia, and that some people are either born that way or predisposed to develop those tendencies. Unfortunately, their sexual desires cannot be acted upon without harming others, although I'm sure many people like this do not act upon their urges as they are also conscious it is going to harm a child irreparably. A certain percentage of the population are therefore, definitely inclined to view children in a sexual way and making it both harder and riskier to access content that might take someone who otherwise wouldn't offend over the edge is necessary. As a quick addendum, I also think confidential therapy for people who find themselves attracted to children is also essential, but many other nations with a more progressive national view of mental health issues struggle with this so I don't see it as a realistic short or mid term goal for India (or even Australia). >telegram Telegram is quite notorious for these kind of things. One day, you are in a Jack Sparrow group. The next day it becomes Epstein Island. The fuck is wrong with you?"
