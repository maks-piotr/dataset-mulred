        "Since you're not allowed to load money through their wallet, it shouldn't work after 29th February. But Paytm has the month of February to address these concerns. Depending on how they respond, they may survive this. The initial order was of March 2022 when RBI had instructed them not to onboard new customers. But from tomorrow, the share would surely plummet like Polycab did after the IT raid news."
