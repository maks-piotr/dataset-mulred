Then when I went to exchange it I was told by the Amazon Cs that they won't replace, return or exchange it, called the sleepy cat customer service and was told that if Amazon sends me a mail citing that they won't return it then they can handle it or work something out then again I called Amazon and somehow this guy accepted the return request but the next day the pickup guy canceled my pickup without any prior call or text and I immediately called Amazon the Cs rep told me to wait while he connects me to a senior and the senior handled it in 10 mins I was told they would pick it up within 72 hours. The pickup was done the next day and I got the refund in 1 fucking hour.",
