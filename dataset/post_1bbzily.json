    "selftext": " So you must have heard about the National Creator Awards organized in Delhi recently.  Malhar Kalambe received Swachhata Ambassador Award for leading clean up drives since 2017. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaYNdGG\\_87k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaYNdGG_87k))\n\nWhen Malhar receives the award, PM says:\n\n>Malhar, among the creators sitting here, there are some that also tell you what to eat.\n\nFor a guy who has made an impact, pointing out flaws in his physical appearance, in front of so many people, in a national event, was a bit insensitive imo. If he was genuinely concerned about his health the suggestion could've been private. Moreover, how do we even know he's unhealthy? He could be much healthier than anyone who looks bulky, but hides their belly fat under clothes. Here's a video of the guy from roadies audition - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuVEYSp11Aw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuVEYSp11Aw)\n\nThe guy took it sportingly, he posted this video on his insta handle. But regardless I feel the remark was unnecessary. I felt like I'm watching my gully uncle body shame one of his relative's kids. What do you think about this?",

        "MudiXi has been excused for far more serious things.. Why do you think an \"insensitive\" body shaming comment is gonna bother him much?",
        "Well, true. \n\nBut even beyond this what bothered me was that very few were calling him out. People were actually in support of PM in the comments I saw on insta and YT. That just got me wondering am I being overly sensitive. Because I don't think I can say that in front of 4 people to anyone who has made such an impact, let alone in front of hundreds of people, when I myself am awarding him for his impact 😭",
        "Modi is jealous of him. He’s tall young and a healthy weight. Unlike modi",
        "Bhai koi fark nahin padta kisiko, sab bhakt hein aur bhar bhar ke vote denge.",
        "I didn't think it was that serious, it was just a light hearted joke. If he told a fat person \"there are people in this crowd who can tell you how to exercise\" then that would have been offensive.",
        "I think issa joke.",
        "Modi got away after cracking a joke off dyslexic people. The same thing if done by anyone other than him would have stoked a huge controversy",
        "I am just happy that it was a guy and not a woman. Or else half the news media would be frothing right now. Since it’s a guy there is no issue. It’s not like Malhar Kalambe is going to go on X and write a post crying about it. So chill OP, if the guy has no issue then why do you have an issue? Why are you taking the PMs comment personally when you ain’t even the intended recipient.",
        "But the professional outragers in this country need their daily dose or else they might have to find an actual job.",
        "Do these people get paid to complain every single day or is it a passion project?\n\nEvery single F\\*\\*kn day there is some new thing that pops up",
        "Bhai...who are you talking about? Modi simply does not care about his perception.....tomorrow his PR company will post a twitter post of him praying at a temple and everything will be forgotten.",
        "Bruh, if the person who got body shamed is not offended why are you taking offence on his behalf?",
        "It seems like I'm the only one not offended by it. I don't understand what's offensive about it?, ",
        "Uninstall reddit and Twitter. Peace",
        "Why are you body shaming our Supreme Leader. How dare you!!!",
        "He deserves it. He assasinated one of our Canadians.",
        "Tbh, we have way more important things to focus on rather than seeing how he treats his puppets",
        "Honestly, the world could do with more body shaming. Eating yourself to death is not good for anyone and if something gets people on the path to lose weight then great. Being fat is not healthy. \n\nSaying that, yes some people are fat because of reasons outside their control (metabolic imbalance, medicines etc) but the MAJORITY of overweight people are overweight because of poor impulse control and lack of exercise. And it’s good for THEM if they are encouraged and told very frankly that it’s not good for them.",
        "I'm not taking offence on the guy's behalf bro, I'm pointing towards the problem in the Prime Minister of our country, body shaming someone who has made such an impact, in a national event, which was organized to appreciate his impact. \n\nJust because the victim doesn't raise his voice against a crime, doesn't mean the crime becomes less criminal. \n\nEven if I were in his shoes, I would have taken it sportingly. However, ask someone who has laughed at a body shaming joke made on them, this sporting nature is only at the surface. Think about it, while someone in your age group is spending time going to the gym, trying to change the way they look, you're freakin cleaning the beaches! And then the PM of your nation, calls you for an award, and this the first comment he makes? Would you feel good about it? \n\nAnd think about the number of people who'd get their body shaming behavior reinforced watching this? This is not just a random guy body shaming a random guy on a random street.",
        "Does Always criticizing MODI helps in something that I don't know.",
        "What is this post LOL? This is probably the least offensive thing that genocider, rape supporter has done.",
        "Let me tell you something, i was underweight throughout my teenage and i was always called names as i was very thin. For me personally, it never affected me, but rather it helped me to eat better and put on weight. There is nothing negative about someone telling you to put on weight. \n\nAccording to your logic if some teacher pointed out that i got low marks in a particular test, i should be offended that they are pointing out that i got low marks. As per your logic if a client is complaining why a particular job is not done in the stipulated time i should complain to the manager that this guy is time shaming me?\n\nIf a teacher is asking me why my marks are low they are marks shaming me.\n\nIf a parent is asking me to put the phone down and start studying he is phone shaming me.\n\nIf my gf is complaining that i don't buy her stuff she is poor shaming me,\n\nWhen my roommate reminds me to clean up my mess, is he cleanliness-shaming me\n\nIf my friend tells me to stop binge-watching TV shows and go outside, is she vitamin D shaming me\n\nWhen my dentist scolds me for not flossing regularly, is he plaque-shaming me\n\nIf my therapist sighs at my latest procrastination excuse, is she productivity-shaming me\n\nAnd if you get offended for other people shaming me maybe you should be really \"Ashamed\" for your misuse of time.",

The only difference is no one cares when someone makes fun of you.",

If you just ‘enjoy food’ you’ll end up with clogged arteries, excess fat in specific regions and the most dangerous visceral fat.\n\nGood point, I'll retract the point I made about it being easier to gain weight then.\n\nHowever, I'm still standing by the statement that a joke on an underweight person is less offensive than a joke on an overweight person.\n\nWhen people make fun of you for being overweight, the subtext is that you're a lazy piece of shit who's consuming in an irresponsible manner. There's actual shame associated with that.\n\nBut when people make fun of you for being underweight, the subtext is that you're not eating enough, that's it. Which is not really a shameful thing.",

        "Exactly. This is the image I have of a leader - elegant, literate, and smart. But it's not just that we don't have a leader like this, but also that we don't have an appreciation of a leader like this.",
        "I'd argue for the contrary. The shame that is associated with body shaming skinny people is of physical weakness, you must have heard phrases like \"do hath ka dhara hai\", \"udd jayega hawa mein\".",
        "Yes I am.",
        "99% of people don't go to the gym and build their physical strength so they have no ground to stand on to make those jokes in the first place. If I made fun of someone for not having big muscles then people will point to me and say \"You don't have any big muscles yourself, what are you talking about?\"",
        "As someone who ran away from india due to our culture not considering body shaming skinny people as an issue , I completely disagree with you and request you to change this mindset. If the subtext in making fun of skinny people is you should eat more, then think again. Noone wants to be bullied for anything.  I was bullied by my whole family whole thru my life for being skinny. Subtext doesn't matter. For my friends, it might be just a casual comment asking me to eat more,  to me it's the 10000th person bullying me. I am skinny but I am healthy and doctors have confirmed it. But still I hate coming to India due to everyone thinking its just concern or joke but for me it's spoiling my mental health.i don't even like my friends there anymore coz they keep asking me to eat more due to concern even after me repeatedly telling that doc said i am good. Having been called skeleton, pencil and shit of these sort for life long, it is a shameful thing to me. So subtexts doesn't matter. Feeling are same and people get affected. By the way asking someone don't you have anything to eat there, is not concern or joke, it is bullying and is in the same level as fat shaming.",
        "For women too bro.. I am the proof. Its insulting and demeaning and is shaming people under the banner of joke or concern.",

        ">I completely disagree with you and request you to change this mindset.\n\nI weigh 120kg myself. I'm the last person to make fun of other people's bodies.\n\nHowever, I have also been skinny in the past. I have also had a lot of people telling me to eat more.\n\nAnd having experienced both sides of the equation, let me tell you that being skinny was a lot less shameful than being overweight for me. The reasons in the subtext I mentioned that is associated with the jokes on each condition.\n\nAnd I got no \"you'll fly in the wind\" or \"pencil\" or \"skeleton\" jokes, all I got was genuine concern. Which didn't bother me at all.\n\nI ate without any care in the world for the past few years and therefore I  have reached my current weight. It was not hard at all, it was the easiest thing to do. I literally did nothing but consume.\n\nIf you're getting bullied though, that's not acceptable and I've already mentioned that in my original comment.",

        "Did I lie tho'?",
        "It depends on person who said so, if different person say the same noone cares",
        "The problem is when everyone thinks they re expressing concern. If concern is on health people would have shut up when I said I am healthy. This is just body shaming taht happens around. And if the 100th person is making the same joke, then it is not joke anymore. Ua experience with both sides might make u think this side is easier, but going through this life long is frustrating.  And hearing from people that it's just concern, well fat shaming can also be explained as concern but that doesn't make it ok. Why do that to other body shapes then? Also it was not harder for u to put on weight doesn't mean it is not hard for others. I would have happily put on weight if i could when I was in india just so I could shut others up. But now I know health doesn't equate to body type and as long as I am healthy I don't care. But I still do feel affected when people think its ok to joke or show concern to skinny people which is actually body shaming too.",

        ">That's not the reason to put on weight or lose weight.\n\nHard disagree, that has been the foundational reason for so many success stories in the weight loss/gain department.

It will definitely be counterproductive. \n\nBut if anyone just feels bad because of merely mentioning weight or that the ideal body image is not theirs, then that’s on them. And frankly that’s good. You only work towards something if you think it will help you be better. I don’t see how Modi engaged in body shaming of the bullying kind.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "What do you think of PM Modi's body shaming remark in the National Creators Award 2024?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "So you must have heard about the National Creator Awards organized in Delhi recently. Malhar Kalambe received Swachhata Ambassador Award for leading clean up drives since 2017. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaYNdGG\\_87k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaYNdGG_87k)) When Malhar receives the award, PM says: >Malhar, among the creators sitting here, there are some that also tell you what to eat. For a guy who has made an impact, pointing out flaws in his physical appearance, in front of so many people, in a national event, was a bit insensitive imo. If he was genuinely concerned about his health the suggestion could've been private. Moreover, how do we even know he's unhealthy? He could be much healthier than anyone who looks bulky, but hides their belly fat under clothes. Here's a video of the guy from roadies audition - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuVEYSp11Aw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuVEYSp11Aw) The guy took it sportingly, he posted this video on his insta handle. But regardless I feel the remark was unnecessary. I felt like I'm watching my gully uncle body shame one of his relative's kids. What do you think about this?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "MudiXi has been excused for far more serious things.. Why do you think an \"insensitive\" body shaming comment is gonna bother him much? Well, true. But even beyond this what bothered me was that very few were calling him out. People were actually in support of PM in the comments I saw on insta and YT. That just got me wondering am I being overly sensitive. Because I don't think I can say that in front of 4 people to anyone who has made such an impact, let alone in front of hundreds of people, when I myself am awarding him for his impact 😭 Modi is jealous of him. He’s tall young and a healthy weight. Unlike modi Bhai koi fark nahin padta kisiko, sab bhakt hein aur bhar bhar ke vote denge. I didn't think it was that serious, it was just a light hearted joke. If he told a fat person \"there are people in this crowd who can tell you how to exercise\" then that would have been offensive. I think issa joke. Modi got away after cracking a joke off dyslexic people. The same thing if done by anyone other than him would have stoked a huge controversy I am just happy that it was a guy and not a woman. Or else half the news media would be frothing right now. Since it’s a guy there is no issue. It’s not like Malhar Kalambe is going to go on X and write a post crying about it. So chill OP, if the guy has no issue then why do you have an issue? Why are you taking the PMs comment personally when you ain’t even the intended recipient. But the professional outragers in this country need their daily dose or else they might have to find an actual job. Do these people get paid to complain every single day or is it a passion project? Every single F\\*\\*kn day there is some new thing that pops up Bhai...who are you talking about? Modi simply does not care about his perception.....tomorrow his PR company will post a twitter post of him praying at a temple and everything will be forgotten. Bruh, if the person who got body shamed is not offended why are you taking offence on his behalf? It seems like I'm the only one not offended by it. I don't understand what's offensive about it?, Uninstall reddit and Twitter. Peace Why are you body shaming our Supreme Leader. How dare you!!! He deserves it. He assasinated one of our Canadians. Tbh, we have way more important things to focus on rather than seeing how he treats his puppets Honestly, the world could do with more body shaming. Eating yourself to death is not good for anyone and if something gets people on the path to lose weight then great. Being fat is not healthy. Saying that, yes some people are fat because of reasons outside their control (metabolic imbalance, medicines etc) but the MAJORITY of overweight people are overweight because of poor impulse control and lack of exercise. And it’s good for THEM if they are encouraged and told very frankly that it’s not good for them. I'm not taking offence on the guy's behalf bro, I'm pointing towards the problem in the Prime Minister of our country, body shaming someone who has made such an impact, in a national event, which was organized to appreciate his impact. Just because the victim doesn't raise his voice against a crime, doesn't mean the crime becomes less criminal. Even if I were in his shoes, I would have taken it sportingly. However, ask someone who has laughed at a body shaming joke made on them, this sporting nature is only at the surface. Think about it, while someone in your age group is spending time going to the gym, trying to change the way they look, you're freakin cleaning the beaches! And then the PM of your nation, calls you for an award, and this the first comment he makes? Would you feel good about it? And think about the number of people who'd get their body shaming behavior reinforced watching this? This is not just a random guy body shaming a random guy on a random street. Does Always criticizing MODI helps in something that I don't know. What is this post LOL? This is probably the least offensive thing that genocider, rape supporter has done. Let me tell you something, i was underweight throughout my teenage and i was always called names as i was very thin. For me personally, it never affected me, but rather it helped me to eat better and put on weight. There is nothing negative about someone telling you to put on weight. According to your logic if some teacher pointed out that i got low marks in a particular test, i should be offended that they are pointing out that i got low marks. As per your logic if a client is complaining why a particular job is not done in the stipulated time i should complain to the manager that this guy is time shaming me? If a teacher is asking me why my marks are low they are marks shaming me. If a parent is asking me to put the phone down and start studying he is phone shaming me. If my gf is complaining that i don't buy her stuff she is poor shaming me, When my roommate reminds me to clean up my mess, is he cleanliness-shaming me If my friend tells me to stop binge-watching TV shows and go outside, is she vitamin D shaming me When my dentist scolds me for not flossing regularly, is he plaque-shaming me If my therapist sighs at my latest procrastination excuse, is she productivity-shaming me And if you get offended for other people shaming me maybe you should be really \"Ashamed\" for your misuse of time. Learn what a Joke is. This is a stupid take Lol ye amreeeka nhi hai Bhai itni si baat pe sochne ka kuch sense nahi hai.aur important topics hai baat karne ke liye.mere dost toh isse 10 Guna jyada bezatti marte the. when the government brings draconian laws to curb our freedoms its fine but the moment they pass a remark its the apocalypse OP aaram kar thoda. Har baat me problem mat nikal Dude's a dumb Boomer through and through. Oh but are to believe he is some kind of political genius and IT expert and economics genius and space explorer and adventure junkie and spiritual guru and charmer of White men and women ... What if the first thing that a teacher says while giving you an award for a race you won is \"well, your marks are low, you see that guy sitting over there, he's the topper\" What if the first thing that your gf says when you do an act of kindness is \"but you're poor\". Making fun of someone's appearance especially a person you have literally just met is a dumb Boomer thing to do. They do this because they have nothing else to say as not naturally witty or charming. :P Man I don't know, I find this humour very shallow. Bruh as per my opinion - IDC. Now please don't opinion shame me Haha. Bhut hi ache environment mein rehra hu mein shyd jiska mein aware hi nai tha. :P Ok Bhai 🤐 Haan waise tbh dosto ki wajah se acha hi hua maine like 29 kgs weight loose karliya warna abhi bhi mota hi rehta koi kuch bolta nahi toh Then, weren't you the first one to opinion shame me? Great bro! Toh bilkul bhi bura nai lagta tha kya jab dost log bolte the? Also I'd like to know ki apne keval isliye lose kiya tha weight ki dost chidhana chhod dein, ya ki apne genuinley acknowledge kiya tha ki nai ye meri sehat ke liye acha nai hai? Don't opinion shame me back bruh. Now i'm offended Now don't age shame ppl bruh. Bhai dono hi hota hai.but like fast food addiction is similar to any other addiction thoda sa push chahiye hi hota hai warna acha khana bante hi diet Tut jaati hai.see end result mai mai aaj apni health se bohot khush hu toh it kinda doesn't matter since wo dost to school mai choot gaye aur like college mai naye dost pe impressionthik thak ban gaya Snowflakes everywhere ❄️❄️ While that might work for some I've a hard time believing it works on the majority. For instance see- It was a good joke tbh. Also the atmosphere of the event was such that it was a better one in that context. Agar ye hi offensive lag raha hai then OP's gonna have a rough life in future fs. Dude gaining weight in a healthy manner is as difficult as losing weight. Gaining weight also involves a strict diet and a good exercise regime. If you just ‘enjoy food’ you’ll end up with clogged arteries, excess fat in specific regions and the most dangerous visceral fat. Shaming people for being skinny is body shaming through and through. The only difference is no one cares when someone makes fun of you. There used to be a time when leaders came across as elegant, literate, and smart, now we get illiterate, crass and there are folks who find it entertaining, not surprised that such comments are made on stage today and no one bats an eyelid. >Dude gaining weight in a healthy manner is as difficult as losing weight, if not more. Gaining weight also involves a strict diet and a good exercise regime. If you just ‘enjoy food’ you’ll end up with clogged arteries, excess fat in specific regions and the most dangerous visceral fat. Good point, I'll retract the point I made about it being easier to gain weight then. However, I'm still standing by the statement that a joke on an underweight person is less offensive than a joke on an overweight person. When people make fun of you for being overweight, the subtext is that you're a lazy piece of shit who's consuming in an irresponsible manner. There's actual shame associated with that. But when people make fun of you for being underweight, the subtext is that you're not eating enough, that's it. Which is not really a shameful thing. Hypocrisy hogyi bhai ji ye toh. Opinion shame karna hai but opinion shame hona nai hai. Now you are hypocrisy shaming me Exactly. This is the image I have of a leader - elegant, literate, and smart. But it's not just that we don't have a leader like this, but also that we don't have an appreciation of a leader like this. I'd argue for the contrary. The shame that is associated with body shaming skinny people is of physical weakness, you must have heard phrases like \"do hath ka dhara hai\", \"udd jayega hawa mein\". Yes I am. 99% of people don't go to the gym and build their physical strength so they have no ground to stand on to make those jokes in the first place. If I made fun of someone for not having big muscles then people will point to me and say \"You don't have any big muscles yourself, what are you talking about?\" As someone who ran away from india due to our culture not considering body shaming skinny people as an issue , I completely disagree with you and request you to change this mindset. If the subtext in making fun of skinny people is you should eat more, then think again. Noone wants to be bullied for anything. I was bullied by my whole family whole thru my life for being skinny. Subtext doesn't matter. For my friends, it might be just a casual comment asking me to eat more, to me it's the 10000th person bullying me. I am skinny but I am healthy and doctors have confirmed it. But still I hate coming to India due to everyone thinking its just concern or joke but for me it's spoiling my mental health.i don't even like my friends there anymore coz they keep asking me to eat more due to concern even after me repeatedly telling that doc said i am good. Having been called skeleton, pencil and shit of these sort for life long, it is a shameful thing to me. So subtexts doesn't matter. Feeling are same and people get affected. By the way asking someone don't you have anything to eat there, is not concern or joke, it is bullying and is in the same level as fat shaming. For women too bro.. I am the proof. Its insulting and demeaning and is shaming people under the banner of joke or concern. >I completely disagree with you and request you to change this mindset. I weigh 120kg myself. I'm the last person to make fun of other people's bodies. However, I have also been skinny in the past. I have also had a lot of people telling me to eat more. And having experienced both sides of the equation, let me tell you that being skinny was a lot less shameful than being overweight for me. The reasons in the subtext I mentioned that is associated with the jokes on each condition. And I got no \"you'll fly in the wind\" or \"pencil\" or \"skeleton\" jokes, all I got was genuine concern. Which didn't bother me at all. I ate without any care in the world for the past few years and therefore I have reached my current weight. It was not hard at all, it was the easiest thing to do. I literally did nothing but consume. If you're getting bullied though, that's not acceptable and I've already mentioned that in my original comment. >Let me tell you something, i was underweight throughout my teenage and i was always called names as i was very thin. For me personally, it never affected me, but rather it helped me to eat better and put on weight. There is nothing negative about someone telling you to put on weight. Exact same situation. It was never hurtful at all, it was only \"why are you not eating\". Calling thin and fast what they are it's not body shaming i get I am fat af and always gets made fun of but it's reality Did I lie tho'? It depends on person who said so, if different person say the same noone cares The problem is when everyone thinks they re expressing concern. If concern is on health people would have shut up when I said I am healthy. This is just body shaming taht happens around. And if the 100th person is making the same joke, then it is not joke anymore. Ua experience with both sides might make u think this side is easier, but going through this life long is frustrating. And hearing from people that it's just concern, well fat shaming can also be explained as concern but that doesn't make it ok. Why do that to other body shapes then? Also it was not harder for u to put on weight doesn't mean it is not hard for others. I would have happily put on weight if i could when I was in india just so I could shut others up. But now I know health doesn't equate to body type and as long as I am healthy I don't care. But I still do feel affected when people think its ok to joke or show concern to skinny people which is actually body shaming too. Why should I put on weight because others are making fun of me? That's not the reason to put on weight or lose weight. That only spoils mental health. Therefore your explanation doesn't make sense too. Modi's pics are jerkoff material for chaddis. >That's not the reason to put on weight or lose weight. Hard disagree, that has been the foundational reason for so many success stories in the weight loss/gain department. It became a huge chip on their shoulder and they felt they needed to prove people wrong and it worked. Because they took it as fuel for their motivation. > I would have happily put on weight if i could when I was in india just so I could shut others up. Out of curiosity, why didn't you? Doctors told me I have high metabolism and that's normal Yea in my case and many others we are still trying to debunk our mental health crisis due to these sucky people . Motivation needs to come from within pr positive ways, people who do it coz of bullying will almost always have negative associations with food in.their mind. Thats not healthy Oh wow. Well that makes me envious of you. Wish I had that. That's what everyone says but that doesn't mean I dont have demons of my past. Now that I have accepted I give replies back , rudely at times. Because noone knows what I went through even though I m healthy. That's fair And a creepy snooper too don’t forget. Okay, put down your phone and go out son Bro chill, you're talking to a wall. Save your braincells Lol That he actually is the rest is just made up stuff. acha yha bhi chalta hai ye sab, socha tha bus insta pe hota hai. Mansi So about 22 years back there was this train... I would agree that bullying someone because of their weight is horrible and won’t have any positive effect. It will definitely be counterproductive. But if anyone just feels bad because of merely mentioning weight or that the ideal body image is not theirs, then that’s on them. And frankly that’s good. You only work towards something if you think it will help you be better. I don’t see how Modi engaged in body shaming of the bullying kind. Mil gayi Khushi ek downvote karke? Thank God, I am not alone who thought this way. I am telling about this to people around me and they say what's wrong with this. If someone is body-shaming you in front of thousands of people, it is not okay. >People here in the comments are like: It is okay, you are in India. Why is it okay in India? We should change that. Dumb ways to get offended I wish I could tell you it was me. Nai hua bhai Nothing. You are very well capable of handling a light hearted comment if you can receive an award from the PM on national TV. Why think of yourself as a genius when you can make them work for you? Bhai? Abhi to papa ban re the. Lol Trust me he doesn't think of himself as a genius he knows exactly how dumb he is - he does project himself as one and idiots lap it up. Elegant leaders who used to sleep naked with their neices His \"underweight\" body is my fitness goals. As a person who has been overweight for all his life (yes ALL my life) it's just become a sassy remark for being more successful (fitness wise) than others. And there is a whataboutism reply lol, so you basically accept that the current leadership is crass but come up with excuses for it by referring to a long dead man's questionable actions from more than 75 years ago."
