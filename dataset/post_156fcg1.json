Both women were thrashed by the local female traders. Later both women left or escaped from the area and did not lodge any police complaints”\n\nDoes that justify being stripped naked? \n\nAnd, yeah people don't lodge complaints because of reputation of the police. Given, the police response, you can guess why would the women that were thrashed felt that way.",
        "no . nothing justifies stripping naked. But when bjp raises allegation , they need to give full context and tell what happened. Police is saying they are already investigating the case. But it is bjp who is blaming other states, even when police there has arrested within 2-3 days. Here in manipur , police didnt arrest after 2 months of incident. And CM is saying 100 such incidents have happened.",
        "> Here in manipur , police didnt arrest after 2 months of incident. And CM is saying 100 such incidents have happened. They are much more angry over video rather than crime.\n\nThat is BJP's MO. Blame others, buy time so people will forget. It worked out for them quite a bit of time. Manipur has been going for months.",

        "Not tribal women, two were suspected thieves, who got mob lynched, unfortunately something that happens in every damn state of this country, cause we love mob justice. Police actually intervened and case was immediately registered but as usual Malware and it’s team of bots made it about BJP. The biggest failure of TMC is handling fake news spreaders in WB, there are many sitting in WB and TMC govt even refuses to even lift a finger but god forbid an ordinary citizen of the state even criticises state govt for something legitimate it will rattle the local leadership to take legal action. TMC is in hands in gloves with BJP, really hope BJP fcuking perishes in WB along with TMC.",
        "But don't tell others about our internal affairs! Then we angry😡",
        "The funny thing is, why/how did Rajasthan come into discussion? Rajasthan isn't seeing riots and pogroms since 2 months. Criminal cases are happening in UP and Maharashtra as well, but BJP supporters are not highlighting that.",
        "What is the point here? It happens all over India so is not their fault? is that what they're trying to say? I really do hope the end of the world is near. So much negativity everywhere.",
        "Thing is, Modi never addressed the bigger issue, tension has been going on there for the last 2 months because that would make it seem like a failure of their state government, which did nothing in 2 months, so he just treated it like a rape case that is being filmed, this is same will all IT cell members and BJP Minister, they are smartly not pointing out the primary matter, but a rape case that must be compared with rape case in opposition ruled states.\n\nIt tells a lot about his mind, how low less it thinks of people.

Nothing new here. \n\nAlso, the public in general, will blame the BJP because it is in power. Next year if some other party(say X) comes to power, then the public will start blaming that party X. \nEg. 2012 Delhi gang rape case. Go and read about the protests that happened. \n\nI can say with certainty that these incidents will keep happening in future. And the drama that is happening today will repeat again. Playing the blame game ain't solving any problems.

Else, we are doomed. \n\nThe change I want for myself: I've decided, to be mindful of the language I speak. I'll refrain from using the kinship language that is derogatory to our mothers and sisters.",
        "That i agree with. TMC is throwing the state’s reputation and endangering the lives of Bengalis all around the country by letting vile propaganda run wild just to protect their corrupt leaders. They’re just hoping BJP’s ground level organisation doesn’t grow and Muslims keep voting for them. Both notions will be broken in 2024 LS unfortunately for TMC.",

        "Bro, the issue is that the number of such events per lakh of population will be skyrocketing in Manipur. Also, since the government is in power, it has to hold accountability, instead of this they are playing Divide and Rule. We citizens don’t know anything about what steps has been taken to stop violence in Manipur. We don’t know what is the current situation which is most probably still bad. So, many girls are going to be raped in next few days there and many murders will happen. Why should government not be asked questions and blamed?
