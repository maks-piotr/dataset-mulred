        "From the article:\n\nX (formerly Twitter), owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has confirmed compliance with executive orders issued by the Indian government demanding the suspension of specific accounts and posts that are allegedly associated with the farmers' Delhi Chalo protest. \n\nThe social media company has expressed its disagreement with the Indian government's directives and emphasized its commitment to freedom of expression. \n\n“The Indian government has issued executive orders requiring X to act on specific accounts and posts, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment,\" the official Global Government Affairs account of X wrote on the microblogging site. \n\n“In compliance with the orders, we will withhold these accounts and posts in India alone; however, we disagree with these actions and maintain that freedom of expression should extend to these posts,\" it said. \n\nThe Global Government Affairs also informed that a writ appeal challenging the Indian government's blocking orders remains pending. “We have also provided the impacted users with notice of these actions in accordance with our policies.\"\n\nDue to legal restrictions, X said it is unable to publish the executive orders but said that making them public is essential for transparency because the lack of disclosure can lead to a lack of accountability and arbitrary decision-making. \nThis came after the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) finalized its emergency order directing top social media companies like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and Snap to block 177 accounts and links related to the farmers' protest to maintain 'public order’.\n\nMeitY issued the emergency orders at the behest of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and these were in addition to the final orders issued on 14 February. The report notes that both the blocking orders issued on 14 and 19 February are conditional and have been issued till the duration of the protest, after which the social media companies can restore these accounts and channels.\n\nThe orders were issued against 35 Facebook links, 35 Facebook accounts, 14 Instagram accounts, 42 X accounts, 49 X links, 1 Snapchat, and 1 Reddit account. Notably, while it is common for the government to take down Facebook and X accounts, this is the first time the Centre has issued a blocking order against Snap.",
        "Where's  the transparency nd freedom  of expression when u r still suspending accounts ,why the pretense 🤔",
        "What do you expect X to do? Break the law? If they break the law, they could get banned in India and the Indian Government will then have greater leverage against the company to censor even more stuff. So they’re saying they’ll comply with the order because it’s the law but disagree with the premise that content on the platform gets censored.",
        "Sure , break the law nd they ain't getting banned    at the end of the day Modiji is an influencer nd there ain't a better platform for him to influence than X .We'll find ways to use X  , it's a way bigger loss to the govt.  Whatsapp  nd X are where majority  of their  lies are forwarded  .Govt bent down to promote KOO as an alternative , nd look at where it's  right now .And all this Censoring bit does the Government  more harm  ,all the narratives  will fall flat nd we'll  just end up looking like  🇨🇳",
        "A multinational corporation like X is not going to break the law. Neither is Meta, Snap or Reddit, all of which received similar orders and complied. You cannot blame the companies for not risking imprisonment of employees and heavy fines. Blame the Government.",
        "Which is what I've  done , but here's  the difference  between  Dorsey nd Musk , Dorsey stood  he was threatened  by the govt that they'll be banned for the same reason (did not happen ) , was threatened  by Ravi Shankar Prasad that they'll  be dragged to the court (did not happen ) nd eventually  their offices in India were raided .. X since acquisition  has shut down Mumbai  / Delhi  office  nd have only 3 people  nd a couple of engineers in Bangalore  ..best of luck raiding them .Elon could've pushed back a lil more. Big difference  between  X nd the other platforms because  of the reach ..",

        "Dorsey had his way of running the business, Musk has his way of running it. Since there’s been a change in management, I don’t think there’s any merit in comparing the two. \n\nBottom line is if X pushes back, and in this case, does not comply with the order, X employees could be imprisoned and the company could be fined. That is the law. Doing otherwise is breaking the law. Why would X do that? Breaking the law is never a good idea, and never a good incentive to make a private company do something. So I think the only blame here lies with the Government, X and other social media platforms are following the law the country’s laid out. They have no choice.",

        "LOL, lip service By X, you clearly don’t have a commitment to freedom of speech if you’re banning it. Do these people not feel stupid while making such comments or do they think everyone is stupid to not pick up on this?",
        "Sure, cool. What does that have to do with what I said and the subject matter of what was being discussed? \n\nIt’s a private company, it’s supposed to cut costs and maximize profits. You can disagree with that philosophy, but that’s not something Musk invented, that is the way corporations work. Thank Adam Smith. \n\nOut of curiosity, what exactly is the difference between a “Nazi” and a “Literal Nazi”?\n\nI hope you’re not being Islamophobic in suggesting there’s anything argon with the multiple US and European corporations, global finance and western governments being hugely reliant on mid eastern money. Sheikhs are cool, right? But since you asked, Kingdom Holding Company, run by Prince Alwaleed, rolled its stake from Twitter to the newly incorporated X corporation.

        "Look at it from another perspective, let’s assume you visit a place where alcohol is illegal and let’s assume you’re someone who enjoys the occasional drink. One would assume you will obey the law of the land and not drink when you’re there. You’d probably simply comply and drink when you go to Daman or Maharashtra. Unless you do it illegally. You’ll not exactly take a stand against the government and the alcohol ban because frankly you don’t give a shit. \n\nApply the same logic to beef, cannabis or anything else for that matter. Their land, their rules. Is it right or wrong is not really the point here, you just comply and then when you leave you do what you feel like in another place where it’s not frowned upon. \n\nIf you feel the rule applied is unjust, protest against it as a citizen which is your right. Unfortunately the government has quashed all forms of dissent. Which means there is a bigger problem. \n\nDon’t expect a company like Twitter to fight your battle. They are answerable only to their shareholders (I guess now that’s Elon) and their employees. They don’t give a shit, their goal is providing users a digital platform to make their voice heard and adding more users while finding a way to monetize. \n\nJust because there is a rule/law does not mean it is right, ethical or moral.

        "I get what you’re saying but I disagree with your premise. It is one thing to have set rules in place, for example, take China, they’re full vocal about not allowing opposing views and don’t allow companies such as X and meta to enter their country. \n\nIf the law of the land specifically says that no dissent is allowed, and a government asks a company to ban it after that, I get it. Corporate is interested in making profits at the end of the day. \n\nWhat I don’t agree with is pretending to take a moral high ground and then agreeing with an arbitrary order of the government. If you are going to listen to whatever arbitrary rule the government comes up with overnight then don’t pretend like you give a shit about free speech. \n\nMy issue isn’t with X agreeing with the government, my issue is with X pretending like they care about freedom of speech while banning accounts at the behest of the government.",
