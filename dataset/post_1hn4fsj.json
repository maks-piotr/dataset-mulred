At a time, when private consumption in India is falling with each month along with rise in inflation, unemployment, low wages, it seems that China has now poised itself to be a global behemoth in the next decade outsing the U.S's influence on the world order.\n\nWhat's more depressing is instead of even acknowledging that we are in a severe state of economic decline along side the bracket of third-world countries, our politicians are fighting like monkeys outside the Parliament and displaying more drama than in an Indian movie. It appears that the next decade will prove to have a pivotal role in the shaping of the country for years to come.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current state of India? Let me know in the comments. ",

        "China beats India in every metric, except population. Comparisons are hilarious. Its like Sudan comparing itself with South Korea just because they have similar populations. India has nothing but a big mouth and bravado, and S. Jaishankar is the perfect example. India is a failed state. We have not been able to take care of basic things like sewage and sanitation. Our cities are a complete mess. There is a massive landfill in Delhi which burns every summer.  Toilets are built with no piping or water connection. Its all hype and marketing. Targets are met, contractors benefit, and leaders get ready for the next election and attacking the other party. The common Indian lives like a cockroach.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrv2pcy14b9e1.jpeg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fc3f3e591145b56167d2370e8a9440351b07291",

        "For those who haven't been to China, you must make the trip. China is the future. While the Indian government focuses on demolishing mosques and increasing taxes, China is soaring ahead with technological advancements and infrastructure developments. From high-speed rail networks that crisscross the country to the sprawling, futuristic skyline of cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, China is redefining urban living.\n\nThe country is a blend of ancient culture and modern innovation. You can explore the timeless beauty of the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army while also experiencing the cutting-edge developments in artificial intelligence and green technology. China's investment in renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, is setting global standards for sustainable growth.\n\nGo to small towns like Guilin and you will awe in wonder. I witnessed a play near the river that had a cast 1000+. The coordination, the mix of fire, light and water. Blew my mind.",

Not only that, that area is the rainiest part of the Tibetan plateau and is called THE AMAZON OF THE TEMPERATE WORLD.  So it would also destroy thatttt...... so much for clean and renewable energy....\n\nAlso the ppl of this sub should refrain from commenting on topics they have no knowledge of. I saw some ppl 'praising' China but the same ppl wouldnot be praising it if they knew the aftermath or if India was doing it.",

Not to mention the amount of ppl displaced and its environmental cost.\n\nIndia may not be perfect but it never made any unilateral attempt to divert courses on rivers that cross into different boundaries.\n\n\nChina built so many dams on the Mekong that thise areas started having droughts. Building a mega dam so close to the Indian border can have dire consequences for India only becoz the Chinese do not have to bear any brunt on what happens downstream. That would be all India's problems to deal with the aftermath. I don't know if thats even legal. \n\nBut most people on this sub have an agenda",

        "China talks about next century, INDIA talks about what happened 500 years back and 5000 year old culture",
        "Finally someone said it. \n\nI read about this project back in 2020 and even in 2017 when China was planning to have it constructed. China's building the dam at the very \"great bend of the Brahmaputra\" from where it enters the Indian territory would give an effective control of the river to the Chinese. \n\nIt's not that India is worried about the water being withheld but quite the contrary. It would be at China's whims when to release water and flood the valley downstream. To counter this india would have to build the same which I believe is under construction already. \n\nMore than 30% of the basin lies in India and is fed by rainwater and other tributaries like dibang, lohit, Subansiri to name a few. \nHence india isn't worried about China controlling it, but China releasing a massive amount of waters uncalled for. \n\nThe gorge there is about 22k feet in depth. Imagine the catastrophic effect of such a massive construction.",
        "You are correct about the flood part but not about the droughts.\nWhile 30 percent of river water is fed by Indian rivers  climate change has made rainfall more erratic in Arunachal Pradesh. \nMelting glaciers and a decreasing trend of rainfall(monsoons are showing a westward inclination) has lead to uncertainity in that region.\n\nIf rainfalls were to continue to decrease then yes that 70 percent water that comes from upstream would also be crucial. Not to mention that the river flow would decrease to Assam and other plains.\n\n\nAnother main point is the destruction of forests and wildlife. The flora and fauna east of the Brahmaputra is not East Himalayan but Hengduanese in origin.\nChina has most of the area (more than 70 percent) but India has only 15 percent. THAT AREA IS THE RICHEST AREA IN TERMS OF PLANT BIODIVERSITY AND ENDEMIC SPECIES IN THE TEMPERATE WORLD.\nBuilding of dams would cause massive displacement of ppl and destruction of these forests.",
        "You're absolutely right. Thanks for adding to it. Yup the feeders of the river are shrinking. Be it the rainfall or tributaries alike. If you look at the map of the Yarlung Tsangpo river as it is called in China and Tibet, you'd see how closely they have built 3-4 dams in a contiguous fashion. That's itself restricts much of the flow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebp081ufjc9e1.jpeg?width=786&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=559fd14b5680890d87a99f634c1cc57ce72b1f97",

        "I posted this in another thread, and now I'm giving a version here. \n\nChina is miles ahead of us. There's no doubt. But do you all realise the cost their citizens incurred to get here? Let me give a few examples of what would've happened if India walked the path of China.\n\n1. If you are not the first born in your family (considering your age as 30+), you wouldn't have existed. Your siblings also wouldn't have existed. If your father or mother aren't the first born in their family, your entire bloodline wouldn't have existed. The same goes for every relative you have.\n\n2. Do you speak any other language than Hindi? Well, too bad. In Chinese India, only Hindi would've survived.\n\n3. Do you follow any other religion apart from mainstream Hinduism? You would've already been enrolled in a re-education camp where the traces of that religion would've been beaten out of you. Good luck to Muslims/Jains/Sikhs too.\n\n4. The farmers who marched to Red Fort? They would have been gunned down by the army before setting a foot near the capital. The hundreds of protests that erupted in India over decades and helped the citizens to force the government to revoke fascist policies? Lol\n\n5. Criticizing BJP? Made a post against Modi? Your own family would've called in the police to have you arrested.\n\nAll this considering Hindi language and Hinduism was the dominant population in the country as that was the base taken by the Chinese government to streamline the country.\n\nI can go on and on. We all look at China and wish we could be like them. But we do not know or wish to ignore the tremendous sacrifices made by their citizens to get here today. They still don't have access to the free internet. Their parents did 16-18 hrs of back breaking work sweating in a factory to earn money. Many died or were displaced. Entire ethnicities were wiped out. Millions were wiped out during famines caused by stupid decisions by illiterate politicians (Mao's sparrow). We came very close to that during the emergency but nothing like what they endured for decades.\n\nWe retained our rights. We retained our freedom to a large extent. We had the right to protest and to voice a different opinion. We had as many choices as possible. We could vote and change our government.\n\nThe Chinese sacrificed them all. They obeyed and then were rewarded for their sacrifices. We lose our shit if Narayanmurthy calls for 70 hrs work week (I don't support it). But the same was mandated in China and the previous generation followed suit. They let go of their rights and democracy.\n\nIf you think that was something we should've also followed, then I'm sorry to say that you've not understood that this thread criticizing the government of India would not have existed in China. All good there.",
        "Why all the glazing for China? India is way better.",
        "As a foreign born Indian visiting India after decades all of this was so clear to me. A population of our size, created under the conditions we did (exploitative colonization) the only way we could fix the country is under a visionary autocrat. You cannot both have idealism and expect significant change. You literally need to wipe out the people and mentality holding the country back so you can push through what is ultimately needed to help the most people possible.",

        "You just summarised more than 75 years of India. India is more than a profit seeking private company that doesn’t care about citizens.",
        "\\> big mouth\n\nthis is true.\n\nUnder the post of a person who posts Indian defence stuff on X, there was a post regarding china's new naval ship. There was a chinese account which said that if India spent all of it's GDP on defense, even then it wouldn't achieve what china did in past few days. Under the reply section another chinese replied to him, telling him to shut up, and not reveal such stuff(this reply was in mandarin). \n\nI have seen such stuff a lot of times. People from China often tells you a lot less than whatever goes on there. People in India are praud army and gala faadna is mandatory.",
        "Finally a sane response among all the half wit responses. Thank you! 🙏",
        "This goes beyond any specific political party/government. The landscape is such that governments are short sighted and more interested in spending the budget on freebies to stay in power. OTOH China worked purely on a long term vision(of a small group of decision makers) and uplifted its economy. ",
        "India needs to get rid of these British governance systems. It’s very inefficient.",
        "The implications of putting dams on Tsangpo/ Brahmaputra is going to be a shitshow. The issue I see is with an unpredictable river like Brahmaputra, this entire project is going to be a ticking time bomb. Even if they go ahead with the project, they are building in an unstable area. It is going to make monsoons even more difficult to control and it can cause droughts. India is already building Subansiri Dam which this ragebait of an article did not mention and the project was dogged by potential impact on downstream areas and often unstable conditions such as landslides etc. Suffice to say the government would not be building it if the Chinese had not built a steady stream of dams. These rivers should not be dammed optimally due to Brahmaputra being volatile and the land being prone to landslides very frequently. This has been one of the reason behind the slow infra development in those areas for ages. Ask any NHPC or BRO engineers, they would tell you hard it is to build even if you have everything without causing some long term damages. This is exactly what we saw in Uttarakhand and in Sikkim later. \n\nThis entire project is synonymous with the dams in Mekong river which China did to control the water flow to their neighbours. Both Cambodia and Vietnam are not happy about it and actually face water level decreases during summers. For both countries, which are highly dependent on rivers, this has been a huge challenge. \n\n  \nAnd to all the brain dead commentators, shove your political bias to yourselves. Tomorrow many of you would happily support unnecessary protests against such infra buildup from our side because you want to stick it to the government and not realising the damage one does with this nonsense. Do not blame a party. Whether it is BJP or Congress, it filled with cynical grifters and opportunists like you folks. Want to see what is the issue with the country, go and up look at your mirror. I am tired of some people from the country pretending that they have  no role in the issues but they deserve credit.",
        "The population here is too politicised to do anything productive in their life. A lot of good policies become victims of politics and are rolled back and then after a few years we cry that India is failed state. Every thing and every move is judged politically which has led us to where we are. And the biggest impediment to growth is the so called steel frame of India—bureaucracy. The political system is designed to prioritise short term gains that help in fetching votes over difficult long term policies that could bring fundamental changes. When you don’t have a common national goal to be rich, then there is no chance you’ll be rich.",
        "Yes you're absolutely correct.\n\nThese reddiotrs are too full of themselves to even acknowledge the damage that China causes on our ecosystems.\n\nYou only need one good earthquake that happened in the 1950s and all shit would go down. Chinese would have nothing to lose its India and the countrues downstream that would have to deal with it. Not to mention the loss of biodiversity in tge world's richest subtropical and temperate ecosystems and the massive displacement.\n\nWeaponising water by China is certainly not necessary.",
        "I do not know what is worse, ignorant public hailing from the so called educated classes willing to give the benefit of doubts to the most heinous of actions by our enemies or the politicians whose world rotate within the confines of Delhi and  have no clue what this country even is. \n\nThe irony of thinking Chinese economy is doing well as mentioned by OP. The world economy is in tatters with the Chinese economy now experiencing an enormous overcapacity and an elusive demand that never came back post opening. In the era of stubborn inflation, central banks including the RBI wants to see tepid growth than a potential supply shock the likes of which we saw twice already which led to enormous increase in both core and headline inflation. The world suddenly has realised that it has oversupply for the demand level at current times and cannot do anything without damaging the economy in the long run. Either decrease supply which would lead to demand contraction in the future indirectly or take of the guardrails and reduce interest rate which would see a very probable risk of high inflation coming back. We have mismanaged Covid globally and with the wars we have decided to dig our graves. Can you imagine for the first time IMF is not able to provide fiscal assistance and bailouts to most countries that are in need of it!\n\nInfantile thinking is what creates the problems in this country. Today as we speak about both Dr Singh and Mr Modi, Mr Modi realises that many of his statements that made on impulse was not warranted given how complicated the situation was back then and still is. We often curse our politicians but South Bombay folks who inhabit this sub with good education and good exposure also seems to the same cardinal errors. \n\nForget about 1950. Sichuan which is located next to Tibet had a huge earthquake in 2008 which levelled entire localities. And such stupidity was the reason why they had a devastating amount of injured and the dead which they hid anyways. It is an unstable region and is not suited for buildup.",
        "Modi had a decade worth of time to improve India. During that time China did significantly more. Both countries have a comparable number of people aka 1:1 (not quite, but you get the idea). So, the conclusion is similar: Modi is incompetent when it comes to the economy.",
        "> While the Indian government focuses on demolishing mosques and increasing taxes\n\nThis is largely due to Modi's ultranationalistic policy. These policies almost never make a country richer. They only feed on division and hate, rather than economic wealth. Often supported by a corrupt clique. One needs to look at that clique, and not just Modi. Modi is just one of those clique that keeps India down for selfish gains. You have a similar problem in Russia with the Putin clique.

They are not seeing how such a dam will affect the downstream areas particularly Arunachal. Brahmaputra is a very volatile river in itself. Building a dam on it is like a ticking time bomb. We already have projects coming up in the Siang area, to control and minimize the impact this dam could have.\n\nRight now, the Chinese economy is staring at a deflationary spiral and an overcapacity in manufacturing, with very low domestic demand. They are looking to export away and flood the international market, which if allowed, will further destroy domestic industries. Countries are putting up barriers to negate this. Their local municipal governments are saddled with debt. Supply chains are slowly moving away from China. They are also staring at an ageing population, meaning a drop in future productivity and more money being diverted away from investing and to social support programmes, which will further burden the younger population. We need to understand that the way they have pursued development is now coming back to bite them hard. If anything, these are potential lessons we can learn from and prevent such similar situations happening to us.",
        "Brahmaputra gets about 75% of its waters from various rivers which join it in India, and from the monsoon. How much impact will a dam on Tsang po have on India? In my limited knowledge,it should be minuscule. But yeah, on second thought, China can block the river creating a large reservoir, only to open the floodgates without notice. This can be disastrous if it is possible.",
        "Some of those \"various\" rivers also originate from Tibet. So there is the possibility of the latter. Building up on your point, any un-towed floodgate opening would be disastrous considering how unpredictable Brahmaputra is. Saying all these do not count on me.

    "light_cleaned_title": "China to build world's biggest dam near border; India waits & watches | India News - Times of India",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "The staggering difference in both fiscal, military and geopolitical power and influence that two neighbouring countries have is absolutely mind-boggling. At a time, when private consumption in India is falling with each month along with rise in inflation, unemployment, low wages, it seems that China has now poised itself to be a global behemoth in the next decade outsing the U.S's influence on the world order. What's more depressing is instead of even acknowledging that we are in a severe state of economic decline along side the bracket of third-world countries, our politicians are fighting like monkeys outside the Parliament and displaying more drama than in an Indian movie. It appears that the next decade will prove to have a pivotal role in the shaping of the country for years to come. What are your thoughts on the current state of India? Let me know in the comments.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "China beats India in every metric, except population. Comparisons are hilarious. Its like Sudan comparing itself with South Korea just because they have similar populations. India has nothing but a big mouth and bravado, and S. Jaishankar is the perfect example. India is a failed state. We have not been able to take care of basic things like sewage and sanitation. Our cities are a complete mess. There is a massive landfill in Delhi which burns every summer. Toilets are built with no piping or water connection. Its all hype and marketing. Targets are met, contractors benefit, and leaders get ready for the next election and attacking the other party. The common Indian lives like a cockroach. This is one of the best summaries of so-called 'Viksit Bharat' that I have some across. Couldn't have put it in more accurate terms myself. For those who haven't been to China, you must make the trip. China is the future. While the Indian government focuses on demolishing mosques and increasing taxes, China is soaring ahead with technological advancements and infrastructure developments. From high-speed rail networks that crisscross the country to the sprawling, futuristic skyline of cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, China is redefining urban living. The country is a blend of ancient culture and modern innovation. You can explore the timeless beauty of the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army while also experiencing the cutting-edge developments in artificial intelligence and green technology. China's investment in renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, is setting global standards for sustainable growth. Go to small towns like Guilin and you will awe in wonder. I witnessed a play near the river that had a cast 1000+. The coordination, the mix of fire, light and water. Blew my mind. itna bhi sach nahi bolneka First of all commenters in this subreddit don't realize WHAT they comment about at all. Those who are saying that India can't build a dam..... dont even realize that indias largest dam 2900MW is being built in Arunachal. But the point is not that..... Building dams so close to the Indian border would mean that countries are trying to control the movement of headwaters and that too in a place that was riled in the 1950s Assam earthquake. This would also trigger India to build massive dams in its area of Siang. So cool until you realize that the actions of both countries would leave ppl displaced and thousands of acres of forests decimated. Not only that, that area is the rainiest part of the Tibetan plateau and is called THE AMAZON OF THE TEMPERATE WORLD. So it would also destroy thatttt...... so much for clean and renewable energy.... Also the ppl of this sub should refrain from commenting on topics they have no knowledge of. I saw some ppl 'praising' China but the same ppl wouldnot be praising it if they knew the aftermath or if India was doing it. Asli account se aaye jayant bhandari ji Yeah we have be doing this a lot lately to watch and wait what chinese do on our borders While the central government Being critical of one's own country is a different thing, some of these users just straight up hate it, and blindly praise any country that's having disputes with our nation. Yes... and they don't realize that weaponizing water would only have a net negative impact on not just India but whatever flows down downstream. Not to mention the amount of ppl displaced and its environmental cost. India may not be perfect but it never made any unilateral attempt to divert courses on rivers that cross into different boundaries. China built so many dams on the Mekong that thise areas started having droughts. Building a mega dam so close to the Indian border can have dire consequences for India only becoz the Chinese do not have to bear any brunt on what happens downstream. That would be all India's problems to deal with the aftermath. I don't know if thats even legal. But most people on this sub have an agenda This, What surprised me most was the level of automation in all walks of life, Even 2-3 star hotels have robots. \"Wait and Watch\": perfectly defines the Indian mentality. China talks about next century, INDIA talks about what happened 500 years back and 5000 year old culture Finally someone said it. I read about this project back in 2020 and even in 2017 when China was planning to have it constructed. China's building the dam at the very \"great bend of the Brahmaputra\" from where it enters the Indian territory would give an effective control of the river to the Chinese. It's not that India is worried about the water being withheld but quite the contrary. It would be at China's whims when to release water and flood the valley downstream. To counter this india would have to build the same which I believe is under construction already. More than 30% of the basin lies in India and is fed by rainwater and other tributaries like dibang, lohit, Subansiri to name a few. Hence india isn't worried about China controlling it, but China releasing a massive amount of waters uncalled for. The gorge there is about 22k feet in depth. Imagine the catastrophic effect of such a massive construction. You are correct about the flood part but not about the droughts. While 30 percent of river water is fed by Indian rivers climate change has made rainfall more erratic in Arunachal Pradesh. Melting glaciers and a decreasing trend of rainfall(monsoons are showing a westward inclination) has lead to uncertainity in that region. If rainfalls were to continue to decrease then yes that 70 percent water that comes from upstream would also be crucial. Not to mention that the river flow would decrease to Assam and other plains. Another main point is the destruction of forests and wildlife. The flora and fauna east of the Brahmaputra is not East Himalayan but Hengduanese in origin. China has most of the area (more than 70 percent) but India has only 15 percent. THAT AREA IS THE RICHEST AREA IN TERMS OF PLANT BIODIVERSITY AND ENDEMIC SPECIES IN THE TEMPERATE WORLD. Building of dams would cause massive displacement of ppl and destruction of these forests. You're absolutely right. Thanks for adding to it. Yup the feeders of the river are shrinking. Be it the rainfall or tributaries alike. If you look at the map of the Yarlung Tsangpo river as it is called in China and Tibet, you'd see how closely they have built 3-4 dams in a contiguous fashion. That's itself restricts much of the flow. China has 3 trillion forex reserves China yearly profit 500 billion dollar+ from exports China fdi yearly 150 to 200 billions China has so much cash they already spend nearly 1 trillion dollars in Africa, pakistan, bangladesh, central Asia, South America, srilanka, nepal,... India is behind China 20 years huge gap India all time trade deficit country , remmitence dependent country We have tapped, untapped natural resources but lack of technology no use India government politicians are smart easily manipulate data, change formulas If anyone question government they give return answer is ur ant India, Cia funded, China funded Banning China from 2020 damages India more it slow down indian economy growth Religion is curse of India development it kills scientific temper make u dumb Smart indians already leaving India long back Our farming is inefficient still depend on edible oil, pulses imports We can't do anything right now to stop Chinese aggresion Only solution is focus on rnd, effective farming, focus on manufacturing along with service sector We don't have any leverage to stop Chinese Our politicians don't have any shame, Politicians family, rich familys already settled in foreign rich countries they don't care China build anything, they don't care for India They only care for easy money looting from common man In future something danger will happen these mfs are the first one left India and support and join with enemy countrys This. Anybody beating their hearts about India is in another world all together. I posted this in another thread, and now I'm giving a version here. China is miles ahead of us. There's no doubt. But do you all realise the cost their citizens incurred to get here? Let me give a few examples of what would've happened if India walked the path of China. 1. If you are not the first born in your family (considering your age as 30+), you wouldn't have existed. Your siblings also wouldn't have existed. If your father or mother aren't the first born in their family, your entire bloodline wouldn't have existed. The same goes for every relative you have. 2. Do you speak any other language than Hindi? Well, too bad. In Chinese India, only Hindi would've survived. 3. Do you follow any other religion apart from mainstream Hinduism? You would've already been enrolled in a re-education camp where the traces of that religion would've been beaten out of you. Good luck to Muslims/Jains/Sikhs too. 4. The farmers who marched to Red Fort? They would have been gunned down by the army before setting a foot near the capital. The hundreds of protests that erupted in India over decades and helped the citizens to force the government to revoke fascist policies? Lol 5. Criticizing BJP? Made a post against Modi? Your own family would've called in the police to have you arrested. All this considering Hindi language and Hinduism was the dominant population in the country as that was the base taken by the Chinese government to streamline the country. I can go on and on. We all look at China and wish we could be like them. But we do not know or wish to ignore the tremendous sacrifices made by their citizens to get here today. They still don't have access to the free internet. Their parents did 16-18 hrs of back breaking work sweating in a factory to earn money. Many died or were displaced. Entire ethnicities were wiped out. Millions were wiped out during famines caused by stupid decisions by illiterate politicians (Mao's sparrow). We came very close to that during the emergency but nothing like what they endured for decades. We retained our rights. We retained our freedom to a large extent. We had the right to protest and to voice a different opinion. We had as many choices as possible. We could vote and change our government. The Chinese sacrificed them all. They obeyed and then were rewarded for their sacrifices. We lose our shit if Narayanmurthy calls for 70 hrs work week (I don't support it). But the same was mandated in China and the previous generation followed suit. They let go of their rights and democracy. If you think that was something we should've also followed, then I'm sorry to say that you've not understood that this thread criticizing the government of India would not have existed in China. All good there. Why all the glazing for China? India is way better. As a foreign born Indian visiting India after decades all of this was so clear to me. A population of our size, created under the conditions we did (exploitative colonization) the only way we could fix the country is under a visionary autocrat. You cannot both have idealism and expect significant change. You literally need to wipe out the people and mentality holding the country back so you can push through what is ultimately needed to help the most people possible. It’ll keep waiting and watching for the next 1000 years Don’t worry guys we’ll bulldoze a Mosque and then promise to build a Temple there within the next 20 years, that’ll show China. What? You don’t want that? Why don’t you go to Syria or Afghanistan? They’re our closest competitors anyway. You just summarised more than 75 years of India. India is more than a profit seeking private company that doesn’t care about citizens. \\> big mouth this is true. Under the post of a person who posts Indian defence stuff on X, there was a post regarding china's new naval ship. There was a chinese account which said that if India spent all of it's GDP on defense, even then it wouldn't achieve what china did in past few days. Under the reply section another chinese replied to him, telling him to shut up, and not reveal such stuff(this reply was in mandarin). I have seen such stuff a lot of times. People from China often tells you a lot less than whatever goes on there. People in India are praud army and gala faadna is mandatory. Finally a sane response among all the half wit responses. Thank you! 🙏 This goes beyond any specific political party/government. The landscape is such that governments are short sighted and more interested in spending the budget on freebies to stay in power. OTOH China worked purely on a long term vision(of a small group of decision makers) and uplifted its economy. India needs to get rid of these British governance systems. It’s very inefficient. The implications of putting dams on Tsangpo/ Brahmaputra is going to be a shitshow. The issue I see is with an unpredictable river like Brahmaputra, this entire project is going to be a ticking time bomb. Even if they go ahead with the project, they are building in an unstable area. It is going to make monsoons even more difficult to control and it can cause droughts. India is already building Subansiri Dam which this ragebait of an article did not mention and the project was dogged by potential impact on downstream areas and often unstable conditions such as landslides etc. Suffice to say the government would not be building it if the Chinese had not built a steady stream of dams. These rivers should not be dammed optimally due to Brahmaputra being volatile and the land being prone to landslides very frequently. This has been one of the reason behind the slow infra development in those areas for ages. Ask any NHPC or BRO engineers, they would tell you hard it is to build even if you have everything without causing some long term damages. This is exactly what we saw in Uttarakhand and in Sikkim later. This entire project is synonymous with the dams in Mekong river which China did to control the water flow to their neighbours. Both Cambodia and Vietnam are not happy about it and actually face water level decreases during summers. For both countries, which are highly dependent on rivers, this has been a huge challenge. And to all the brain dead commentators, shove your political bias to yourselves. Tomorrow many of you would happily support unnecessary protests against such infra buildup from our side because you want to stick it to the government and not realising the damage one does with this nonsense. Do not blame a party. Whether it is BJP or Congress, it filled with cynical grifters and opportunists like you folks. Want to see what is the issue with the country, go and up look at your mirror. I am tired of some people from the country pretending that they have no role in the issues but they deserve credit. The population here is too politicised to do anything productive in their life. A lot of good policies become victims of politics and are rolled back and then after a few years we cry that India is failed state. Every thing and every move is judged politically which has led us to where we are. And the biggest impediment to growth is the so called steel frame of India—bureaucracy. The political system is designed to prioritise short term gains that help in fetching votes over difficult long term policies that could bring fundamental changes. When you don’t have a common national goal to be rich, then there is no chance you’ll be rich. Yes you're absolutely correct. These reddiotrs are too full of themselves to even acknowledge the damage that China causes on our ecosystems. You only need one good earthquake that happened in the 1950s and all shit would go down. Chinese would have nothing to lose its India and the countrues downstream that would have to deal with it. Not to mention the loss of biodiversity in tge world's richest subtropical and temperate ecosystems and the massive displacement. Weaponising water by China is certainly not necessary. I do not know what is worse, ignorant public hailing from the so called educated classes willing to give the benefit of doubts to the most heinous of actions by our enemies or the politicians whose world rotate within the confines of Delhi and have no clue what this country even is. The irony of thinking Chinese economy is doing well as mentioned by OP. The world economy is in tatters with the Chinese economy now experiencing an enormous overcapacity and an elusive demand that never came back post opening. In the era of stubborn inflation, central banks including the RBI wants to see tepid growth than a potential supply shock the likes of which we saw twice already which led to enormous increase in both core and headline inflation. The world suddenly has realised that it has oversupply for the demand level at current times and cannot do anything without damaging the economy in the long run. Either decrease supply which would lead to demand contraction in the future indirectly or take of the guardrails and reduce interest rate which would see a very probable risk of high inflation coming back. We have mismanaged Covid globally and with the wars we have decided to dig our graves. Can you imagine for the first time IMF is not able to provide fiscal assistance and bailouts to most countries that are in need of it! Infantile thinking is what creates the problems in this country. Today as we speak about both Dr Singh and Mr Modi, Mr Modi realises that many of his statements that made on impulse was not warranted given how complicated the situation was back then and still is. We often curse our politicians but South Bombay folks who inhabit this sub with good education and good exposure also seems to the same cardinal errors. Forget about 1950. Sichuan which is located next to Tibet had a huge earthquake in 2008 which levelled entire localities. And such stupidity was the reason why they had a devastating amount of injured and the dead which they hid anyways. It is an unstable region and is not suited for buildup. Modi had a decade worth of time to improve India. During that time China did significantly more. Both countries have a comparable number of people aka 1:1 (not quite, but you get the idea). So, the conclusion is similar: Modi is incompetent when it comes to the economy. > While the Indian government focuses on demolishing mosques and increasing taxes This is largely due to Modi's ultranationalistic policy. These policies almost never make a country richer. They only feed on division and hate, rather than economic wealth. Often supported by a corrupt clique. One needs to look at that clique, and not just Modi. Modi is just one of those clique that keeps India down for selfish gains. You have a similar problem in Russia with the Putin clique. They stole a LOT of money. Yup The actual small town of china are dirt and dust just like India. You went to propaganda showcase Why do these comparisons always completely ignore the history of the two nations and their governance systems? China didn't suffer like India did through colonization but regardless, one of the biggest reasons for China's development has been the fact that its a dictatorship r/ListOfRedditTrolls While democracy is flawed, it protects freedoms our ancestors fought hard to secure. It’s troubling that some would rather support authoritarian regimes like China, which detains Uyghurs in camps and disregards human rights than work to improve our own democracy. Despite its imperfections, democracy is still far better than losing our freedom to dictatorship China steals technology and I would live in a imperfect democracy rather than a authoritarian regime based on communism solution to slavery is more slavery??? Freedom and liberty is fundamental to human nature and peace of mind. Autocratic countries don’t need institutions as they work of terror. Democratic countries need to build institutions and yes, it takes time. US had to see a bloody civil war to end slavery.I would prefer to wait another 20 years to get similar amount of money as China if I get to keep my freedom. China is literally years ahead of india, comparing china to USA is much more correct. India is like brazil or Mexico, with the added spice of religion fanaticism China does not bulldoze mosques??? Revolution uproots an entire society and its pre-existing social structures and orders. That's what happened in China in the 20th century, that's why they were able to change the image of their nation, but in doing so millions died. India did not have any such revolution, so the archaic social and cultural orders still oppose and hinder the ushering of a modern age, but on the bright side there was no bloodbath. China and USA ??? Seriously you have no clue about the level of civil rights and freedoms USA gives to its citizens and immigrants. China can never even come close. And yes civil rights matter for economic growth. Civil rights USA is the winner, no competition there. But infrastructure? Nah chian beats USA now. Better cities, better railways, better- oh actually USA doesn't have any high speed railways. Better Metro transits, better public transport in general, better healthcare, better porta and so on. Would you rather wait 20 years to get where China is today or give up the liberal India constitution. India had come way ahead from where we were when British left us. We have a lot of work to do on our institutions but still its better than living under a dictatorship I never said it’s a good solution. I just said it’s the only way to achieve the same level of progress as fast as China did. Glad you’re not willing to compromise on your ideals but then you have no right to complain or expect better. Your whole lifetime will likely pass before there’s significant progress made. Of course, they can also build a hospital in a day. Now you are ok with bulldozing mosques ? Or just when done by communists who want to invade our country Everybody wants to be like China but not ready to go through the process - Just like everyone wants to go to heaven but no body wants to die >one of the biggest reasons for China's development has been the fact that its a dictatorship There are liberal democracies that are well developed. Is that you Jaishankar? Also go read a bit of Chinese history and western imperialism in china during the 19th and 20th centuries If you think that India is comparable to Brazil and Mexico that is also kind of deluded! India’s PPP adjusted per capita income is USD 10000. It is 20000 for Brazil and 25000 for Mexico! This whole we are as rich/poor as Latin American countries is a new coping mechanism. Latin America is poor when compared to EU and US but for India it is a very rich and developed place (barring few exceptions like Venezuela) India only comparable to Pakistan, nepal, bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, subsahara Africa countrys Still India population growing with less resources Bimaru states are big burden most of the funds goes to these states wastesd Because of these 4 states all India states fuked It's cute of you to think China doesn't bulldoze mosques. Liberal democracies like the west built on the backs of colonialism? Those liberal democracies? Woah woah have they heard about India’s revolutionary decision to tax popcorn This is a well-articulated answer. India focuses solely on polishing its image in everything, while at the ground level, the situation is like a dog-eat-dog world. If you travel within a 100 km radius of wherever you live and visit villages, you’ll find that they are still living in conditions similar to the 5th-6th centuries. Yet, the people of this country are so hypocritical that they keep shouting ‘My country is great,’ even as they struggle to survive and experiencing animal like life. Didn’t say that. Also cute of you to fixate on the one thing you can actually bring up a counter point on. Compare us to China when we have the capability to build a hospital in a day. Japan, South Korea, Germany etc developed from 0 after ww2. Bro come the fuck on lmao who do you think propped up those countries during their initial phase of growth? Spoiler: the liberal democracies that had the resources due to colonization. Please pick up a history book, I am begging you. Lee Kuan Yew's statement emphasizes that China and India should not be mentioned together. As we approach the 2030s, this distinction is even more relevant. India is a retreating image in China's rearview mirror. It's getting truer day by day. Can you please compare these two countries based on outcome and not process? BTW, democracy doesn't just mean voting and elections. It also means raising the standard of living inclusively, and China has almost championed it. China is no Germany 2.0. It surprises me that some, like yourself, don't get it. The outcome is inherently dependent on the process - especially in comparative politics. China's ability to oppress its citizens is a major reason why it has been able to move forward It's your fault, man. You're in the r/india subreddit where anything other than India bashing and foreign country glazing is strictly prohibited, thank you very much. What good is democracy if it can't meet the aspirations of people, raise the standard of living? No food on the table, no salary to draw etc...but Voting?..Yes. 😆 Democracy in the US works because they earn much and are developed on an individual level with high hdi and literacy rates. India is not the US. At this point, anyone who thinks India is way better than anyone else out there is pretty much like a flat earther... India has curry! Have fun moving to China then bro. Unlike you I prefer having my rights Dictatorship works as long as its your guy right? I am seeing a lot of comments praising Chinese development and all. Such folks should try to understand more on how such growth has come about and what it is costing China presently. They are not seeing how such a dam will affect the downstream areas particularly Arunachal. Brahmaputra is a very volatile river in itself. Building a dam on it is like a ticking time bomb. We already have projects coming up in the Siang area, to control and minimize the impact this dam could have. Right now, the Chinese economy is staring at a deflationary spiral and an overcapacity in manufacturing, with very low domestic demand. They are looking to export away and flood the international market, which if allowed, will further destroy domestic industries. Countries are putting up barriers to negate this. Their local municipal governments are saddled with debt. Supply chains are slowly moving away from China. They are also staring at an ageing population, meaning a drop in future productivity and more money being diverted away from investing and to social support programmes, which will further burden the younger population. We need to understand that the way they have pursued development is now coming back to bite them hard. If anything, these are potential lessons we can learn from and prevent such similar situations happening to us. Brahmaputra gets about 75% of its waters from various rivers which join it in India, and from the monsoon. How much impact will a dam on Tsang po have on India? In my limited knowledge,it should be minuscule. But yeah, on second thought, China can block the river creating a large reservoir, only to open the floodgates without notice. This can be disastrous if it is possible. Some of those \"various\" rivers also originate from Tibet. So there is the possibility of the latter. Building up on your point, any un-towed floodgate opening would be disastrous considering how unpredictable Brahmaputra is. Saying all these do not count on me. I did read up on this topic many a times but I definitely am not fully right let alone credible."
