I live in a place where this instrument is not easy to buy, and I'm buying from someplace else in my country, so any advice and what things to look for is appreciated.\n\nOthers I looked to buy are more expensive, almost double, and don't have ornaments on the bayan.  I don't know if that's something to look for.\n\nThanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5zwiubu5kqa1.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=440e8f4ffe3f15c85b1b5be2f62cbebc57d4ab5b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhs3s9hv5kqa1.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=30712095cdbddae69d2aa59c675b0c3808618a63",
