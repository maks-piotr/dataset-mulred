        "Can I get away with murder if I kill in name of God?\n\nRidiculous honestly. Just do your damn job and go home.",
        "What are you trying to say mate?",
        "most normal people were saying this to begin with , which is why i'm surprised the SC came to the same conclusion",
        "These judges need to do their job at work, not practice religion. \n\nThey are judges, not priests.",
        "How did you come to the conclusion that judges are practicing (or bringing) their religion here?",
        "And they did their job. I am still not getting you.",
        "Bro, tell me what are you cooking? Maybe I will try too and talk random meaningless things",
        "Many people from the north part of India criticized hindus of the south for not being aggressive on the #TirupathiLaddu issue. This is simply because we dont let emotions over-rule over facts. Trust the system we have placed and it work it out. \"Keep god out of politics\"!",
        "So what does the report actually say? Does it or does it not contain the implied ingredients at all?",
        "The joke is on SC. God IS politics here. The citizens who believe otherwise, that some political outfit is out to 'save their religion' are fucking morons.",
        "If you read the foot notes you will understand. For example, there was something like if you feed too much of certain seeds or if the milk is from a new mother cow these readings could be wrong. Of course, similar effect of it was adultered. So coming to the conclusion that it was adultered ignoring the other possibilities is the issue.",
        "Typical Supreme Kotha moment. Their reaction would be opposite if the same thing happened in a mosque or church. When Nupur Sharma had quoted the Qur'an and then a tailor was killed in udaipur the supreme kotha said that the country is on fire due to her loose tongue.",
        "SC is filled with jokers... Lab report say that certain chemicals are found that originate from animal fat , this is clear case of adulteration to make cheaper ghee and earn more profits\nThinking it comes from utensils or it comes from the process is bullshit.\nIt is just the case of L1 and to get large scale of orders at just Rs 300 Adulteration is done",
        "lol, it‚Äôs ghee, where do they think it comes from? The ghee tree?",
        "The level of social development is low and so is the level of education. In conditions like these, religion and bigotry in general gives you a warped kind of dignity, drive, pride, etc that you would usually lack. Most of us don‚Äôt care about the subjective at all, despite its importance.\nLike l‚Äôd say if you asked me what the main problem is, l‚Äôd say lack of a sense of dignity and comfort. If you feel like you can‚Äôt live with dignity as a normal person, you will become prone to falling prey to heroism bullshit\n\nThis is what's happening in North",
        "No wonder BJP can easily brainwash indians.",

        "Ghee is animal fat.",
        "Dude What my comment has to do with the BJP... I said it is a  clear case of Adulteration. The Desi ghee with the price range of Rs 300 can only be achieved by mixing Vegetable Oil or Animal fat ...",
        "So, the report is inclusive?",

        "It is sad indeed. The efficiency he showed and the respect he had from everyone in the 90s to falling down to his current level, it is sad indeed. Pawan Kalyan & BJP are not good for him or his son or his party even in the short term (next 2 years), let alone in the long term.",

Why didn't they send the samples to the main central Lab in Delhi??? And Cbabu waited months for to release this inconclusive report, right before the election. Riight",

I am not saying that we should stop criticising. But i just ask for a less generalising in labels South India isn't just TN and Kerala.
