(yes training is needed to know where to pee, remember the time you peed in the hall of your house in front of guests ?  or wore a diaper)\n* Were there extenuating circumstances ?\n\nLet's not be all \"BeAdbi\" and \"Gustaq-e-Mandir\" about this situation.",

And it's not just about the staff, tourists and visitors too, need to be mindful of such things. There's just a basic level of decency one should maintain at cultural heritage sites. Plus, actions like these can have consequences, considering the [Archeological Survey of India](https://asi.nic.in/) rules.",

His job is to literally not let tourists damage or even walk on top of the temple structure. How is peeing harmless? \n\nEven if he has a medical condition, it does not excuse damaging a UNESCO World Heritage. It’s something he needs to manage with the help of his employer. \n\nI know we do not live in an ideal world, but shifting blame does not help eradicate the problem.",
        "It's called focussing on the solution.\n\nNormally security guards operate on 12+ hours shift rotations and are paid bare minimum wage. \n\nif one expects them to understand what they are doing apart from standing there next to a rock structure for 12 hours straight is ENABLEMENT and Training.",

        "Name and shame. Post him on twitter. He shouldn’t do this on a holy site",
        "Training is connected to civic sense or civilization, not just correlation but I think it's causation. If you pee in front of your guests today, how your family or guests would react is an outcome of that.  \n\nNot to shame or demean anyone but objectively speaking, those who have hitherto been excluded from civilization to do their own thing, it's not easy to train them. Only incentives will work. For eg mobile phones and payments took off here because of their value. I don't know how but if you can figure out a way to pay people to use toilets, with some luck a decade from now they would get used to it.",

I'm trying to make a fuss so that it reaches someone who can enforce or reiterate the guidelines on the staff and threaten them with consequences if they fail even after that. I do not know who would be such an authority and how to access them.",

        "I can confirm that the Men's toilets are very well maintained, infact amongst the best I have seen in a public setting.\nI traveled to Konark with friends during May last year. I was not keeping well(running stomach) and had to use the loo multiple times and not once was I hesitant to use it! It was clean, well maintained and not smelly, as far as I remember.\n\nI think twice before accusing someone of anything, but this looks likely a case of the gaurd being lazy or maybe bladder control issues. I am sure he would have not attempted this stunt if he knew someone was photographing him - hope he learns from this!\n\nBut this also is a wider, persistent problem that needs stricter laws along with accessible (not in this case) infrastructure for solution.",

Because 99% places have no such thing, so in the one place which does also people will cross anywhere. Why do all vehicles drive near divider whether small, large, slow, fast? Because 99% of places the left lane is blocked by random things. \n\nSame thing here, until the wider problem is addressed then there is zero point in focusing on individuals like this. Of course, that's assuming the goal is to actually fix the issue instead of just shaming one person.",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Saw a security guard peeing on the walls of Konark temple right near the temple \"Kitchen\" area. There's a newly constructed excellent toilet outside the walls about 100 metres from where he's standing. :(",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Source: Photo taken by me at Konark Sun temple with a Pixel 7 Pro. Lol Terrible Ffs, he isn't peeing on the temple walls itself. It's the outside wall. Give the guy some slack. He is helping to save greenery I hope you are being sarcastic. He's peeing on the temple perimeter wall. Does he really have to pee on the temple structure itself or one of the sculptures for it to be a problem? Peeing on unesco world heritage...they fucking don't know the importance of this temple for odia. Please share it on Facebook Aren't there staff toilets? I don't have an alt account on Facebook and would prefer not to post by myself. If you want to post on my behalf, you are free to do so as long as you point to the original post. Thanks! Peeing in toilets is for noobs. Real men pee out in the open. /s It's the attitude of the majority of us. May be the staff washroom is a little far. just gonna say this.. Civic sense and common sense need to be taught in our country more than math and science. There are no toilets inside the temple complex to the best of my knowledge. However, the free public toilet is not far. If he walked 100m, he would be inside these toilets. I'm sure the female staff use those toilets and not the temple walls. He's just being lazy and extremely careless. I am pretty sure no action would be taken Marking territory. Good strategy for gaurding. Idiot yep yep shit in the open and one gets to badass status Before we comment on the civic sense of the security guard in question * Are there enough accessible toilets for the security guard ? * Have they been provided with training ? (yes training is needed to know where to pee, remember the time you peed in the hall of your house in front of guests ? or wore a diaper) * Were there extenuating circumstances ? Let's not be all \"BeAdbi\" and \"Gustaq-e-Mandir\" about this situation. Napoleon momint My dog also pees to mark his territory his also a guarding dog but who pees on the wall of a temple 🥲 😮‍💨 Even if it's a bit far, it's about respecting the place. It's a temple, not just some random alley. And it's not just about the staff, tourists and visitors too, need to be mindful of such things. There's just a basic level of decency one should maintain at cultural heritage sites. Plus, actions like these can have consequences, considering the [Archeological Survey of India](https://asi.nic.in/) rules. Everybody is eco eco until people start taking natural fertilizer treatment in their own hands. Then they lose their shit. /S jeez if the toilet is far, keep a can nearby There are enough toilets. I do not know about whether there are relievers, but it is a question of whether blame lies on him entirely or the security management also shares the blame. Training is not needed to not pee on the structure you’re tasked with protecting. His job is to literally not let tourists damage or even walk on top of the temple structure. How is peeing harmless? Even if he has a medical condition, it does not excuse damaging a UNESCO World Heritage. It’s something he needs to manage with the help of his employer. I know we do not live in an ideal world, but shifting blame does not help eradicate the problem. It's called focussing on the solution. Normally security guards operate on 12+ hours shift rotations and are paid bare minimum wage. if one expects them to understand what they are doing apart from standing there next to a rock structure for 12 hours straight is ENABLEMENT and Training. He graduated from Good Boys Guarding Institute Name and shame. Post him on twitter. He shouldn’t do this on a holy site Training is connected to civic sense or civilization, not just correlation but I think it's causation. If you pee in front of your guests today, how your family or guests would react is an outcome of that. Not to shame or demean anyone but objectively speaking, those who have hitherto been excluded from civilization to do their own thing, it's not easy to train them. Only incentives will work. For eg mobile phones and payments took off here because of their value. I don't know how but if you can figure out a way to pay people to use toilets, with some luck a decade from now they would get used to it. can this be reported to the authorities?!! I visited sun temple this year and it's so beautiful... I am now quite excited to see other World Heritage site. So Real men are real men at home also ? Another difference between a security guard and an average person visiting the temple is that the former is getting paid to take care of the place, so he should be more responsible than the average person. They should make stuff toilets What is the condition of the toilet? Women will use it out of compulsion, even though it might be extremely unsanitary and filled with diseases, mosquitos etc. Pointing out one person like this, for an institutional problem that exists all over the country isn't fair. If he's Muslim uapa will be applied If he's hindu, it's awar kulcha. Yaar yeh public urination ki aadat jayegi nahi kya kabhi logo ki... This is inexcusable when there's a public washroom nearby. You should have blurred the photo A definite shame. Why didn't you approach and advised him. Why garner views on Reddit or other social media platforms. I tried looking for a manager, but decided against it. I would prefer not to report an individual employee and make him lose his job compensation. I'm trying to make a fuss so that it reaches someone who can enforce or reiterate the guidelines on the staff and threaten them with consequences if they fail even after that. I do not know who would be such an authority and how to access them. inko sone ki katori do to bhi bheek hi mangenge I can confirm that the Men's toilets are very well maintained, infact amongst the best I have seen in a public setting. I traveled to Konark with friends during May last year. I was not keeping well(running stomach) and had to use the loo multiple times and not once was I hesitant to use it! It was clean, well maintained and not smelly, as far as I remember. I think twice before accusing someone of anything, but this looks likely a case of the gaurd being lazy or maybe bladder control issues. I am sure he would have not attempted this stunt if he knew someone was photographing him - hope he learns from this! But this also is a wider, persistent problem that needs stricter laws along with accessible (not in this case) infrastructure for solution. Pathetic let him cook Thats a UNESCO WORKD HERITAGE SITE !!!!! We don’t have enough clean toilets 🚽 that’s the problem, not this security guard peeing. I’d have done the same thing probably. I had to go. JEEZ Hahaha wtf is this comment even I definitely don’t “remember the time I peed in the hall of my house in front of guests.” Thanks for the confession but what a weird fetish bro lmfao maybe they got a bladder infection. Then build a toilet for him.. where else is he supposed to go? Did you even read the post? Kyu naukari khaa raha hai gareeb ki Topi pehna do safed color ki, usko. Phir dekho systum ka effect He is a Muslim trying to defame Hindu holy place. I've seen a guy pee on a school wall once. And i thought that was disrespectful! This guy proves me wrong. Plz. A big percentage of men pee outside. It's impossible for all of them ro have a bladder infection. These men just don't give a shit, and will do whatever they want. Let's socially get this guy into the local policemen's attention and ask for some serious charge [When Tank Bund was out of bounds for Hyderabadis](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/when-tank-bund-was-out-of-bounds-for-hyderabadis/article67641594.ece) > Only the British, ruling nobility of Asaf Jah dynasty and Paigah nobles could use the Tank Bund road as it was feared the general public may leave it damaged We haven't changed, have we? No disrespect to any security guard but overall the staff of government institutions don't give a f**k about the cleanliness. In my university they've spit vimal in every corner, basin, dustbin. average liberal behaviour. Ignore our fault blame it on society and institutions fricking victim card. Make more washrooms then. Why TF these stupid people are even recruited for the temple security who don't have any love for the temple. Goverment should get away from temples so that the local community could recruit loyal devoted people r/Odisha Nevertheless if this specific place was different, it's still an institutional problem. Why do people cross roads anywhere instead of going to zebra crossing? Because 99% places have no such thing, so in the one place which does also people will cross anywhere. Why do all vehicles drive near divider whether small, large, slow, fast? Because 99% of places the left lane is blocked by random things. Same thing here, until the wider problem is addressed then there is zero point in focusing on individuals like this. Of course, that's assuming the goal is to actually fix the issue instead of just shaming one person. There are plenty near the temple. But you need to walk 100 metres. You can't make a washroom in front of his penis. Isiliye .. I hate this .. someone get in touch with him .. and beat him till he apologises ! * clears throat \\* Vishwaguru banane ki rah mein ek aur kadam It’s not a wonder if he pees inside anywhere also. My friends and I had this argument and I told him that it is a cultural issue that INDIAN males pee everywhere and Indians litter everywhere but my friends argued that Indians do it because of lack of decent toilets and waste disposal facilities. If OP is to be believed then there is a new toilet facility there and my argument wins - it is a cultural issue that Indians pee almost anywhere without shame. So? Indians shit on streets and rape woman like there is no tomorrow. There weren't adequate public toilets and garbage bins before, so Indians peed and littered everywhere. Now there are toilets and garbage bins almost everywhere, but the practice still continues. People don't even think it's a problem. I think he is jerking off to the sexy sculptures depicting sex and blowjob scenes. That’s what I said - it is in Indian culture to not respect the environment you are part of and to least bother about the inconvenience to others. If it was not then toilets would have been built automatically cos 1.4 billion people can’t live without toilets but no one cares cos peeing anywhere is perfectly acceptable. strict action must be taken against this asshole Peeing outside or peeling on the temple wall is the problem? Surveillance HQ: Everyone be vigilant during patrol. Guard: Absolutely. We are guarding as our own. HQ: Make sure you translate this in action. I don’t need any incidents. Guard: At once. I am marking the territory… anyone who crosses this line will face my wrath! HQ: (sees this pic) Don’t pee on the site again! You moron. I only asked you to walk faster. Guard: I am sorry, I take work goals personally. Congratulations OP, you just exemplified why the government has a hard time drilling \"swachh bharath abhiyaan\" into our peoples' heads. You chose to win the employment battle to lose the cleanliness war. But the irony is that this person may be identified anyway because you decided to post it on reddit. Hell, it is possible that now instead of the actual perpetrator an innocent colleague will be the one getting suspended. Instead what you should have done is reported it to the higher authorities present there as well as sharing this information with the Archeological Survey of India and the relevant ministries of Orissa the centre, that too in a public manner. Jahan soch waha shauch Deewar ko patrol karne wala ek admi rakh aur usko Rancho ka electric chammach de do Yet women on their periods are not allowed. Irony! As per the reports, this guy has been fired from his job by the management authority of the temple. What reports? Main Bhi Chowkidar ⛲🧜‍♂️ First question, is there a bathroom nearby that they can use to pee in? No? Now you know what the problem is. I have also peed in some such temple because there wasn't a frigging bathroom....... Toilet outside the walls........now you know where the problem is. He may get fired for leaving his post for walking outside the temple during his duty time........again blame the temple for not having a toilet inside it's walls. I'm an atheist, so to me, the temple is not that different from a random alley. Failure of temple management to provide clean toilets to their employees. It is def labour law violation. Fine them first. 🤣 Have you been to Konark temple? There are multiple toilets. Its just a monument, there are no idols in the temple nor any worshipping. Agar yahi kaam koi masjid mai karta tho tab mai bhi yahi kahunga. why the suprise?? This is not a worshipping temple, Konark is a UNESCO site but worshipping doesn't take place, there are no idols. Its just called the sun temple. Local community is even worse, govt actually does an amazing job in Konark if you ever visit, its literally close to the beach and there are a lot of public toilets. Agar koi masjid ke bahar yee karta tho tab kya kehte? I have been to konark although few years back, there are like dozens of public toilets, why the hell is he peeing outdoors. Assalam walekum Who are you against? Institutions or the subjects? Not flaming you but just conflicted. Institutions are not doing their job right and the Indian \"subjects\" are unruly and do not follow the rules they are supposed to. Both of them are true imo. OP has literally mentioned the toilet is 100m away! So it is a subject's problem, India has a peak amount of toilets it ever had with rigorous growth in the past decade. Still it's an institutional problem? It's not a bedroom it's a fricking temple ffs. You're not supposed to have a toilet inside. But if I say the Russians elevated Finnish to sapience, I will be the racist here. +1 it's literally not hard to understand this simple fact. We can't keep blaming institutions and infrastructure available, when people like in OP's post do whatever uncivilized thing they want (disgracing af) looks like he’s standing guard.. DISGUSTING FILTHY HUMAN jeez Exactly we don't have civic sense at all it can come sound rude but more than enough people don't know how to behave in public settings in general we are always entitled and have this zero fucks attitude.... +rep India is a polluted cesspool. Institution and subjects I mentioned was in a macro level. I AM agreeing with what you are saying regarding the temple. mutra visarjan on unesco world heritage He should be fired. That would be the best punishment for him. what's there to blur Was there another guard to cover his post ? Or was he peeing near his post Should have posted the fuckers name also. Ese hi logo ko guard ke naukri me nahi rakhna chahiye. Pee is a good form of weed control. What about people farting inside?! Someone is about to lose their job, lol! Imagine how many people have pissed on this temple throughout its existence. Sure the XIII century architects took that into account when they was building it. It’s india, what did you expect? Oooh this man boutta get caned! Or the ‘free public toilet’ is filthy (as you’d expect in most places in India) and he prefers doing it outside Guard be like: ,mein yahaan ka jaikant shikre as he should Govt should install Rancho’s shock inducing invention at various points to stop these muttads You gotta go when u gotta go, i guess Don't they have wash rooms nearby Time portal transportation Another #PeeGate scandal unleashed! I am vising Puri these days and today I'm at Konark Sun Temple. Heard about this incident today from the locals... I wish I could have spectated it myself! Any one who can help me create a Remotask from India I will pay him 25 use for each my WhatsApp +254750435141 Doubt it. Security guard job has to be the least paid, most stressful and longest jobs in the country. Old habits die hard? Literally everywhere I have been to in India, I see men peeing in the street in broad daylight Bro shit in your kitchen then Yawn! Average Indian etiquette. This is a good example of why foreigners get upset with Indian pricing. They have to pay 10x what Indians pay to see poorly maintained historical sites that for some reason smell like…. *sniff* *sniff* what is that, piss?! Rest of the world changed everyone equally without discrimination and 0 pee. The man was hydrated more than his common sense. A toilet in a Temple sounds like an oxymoron! I saw the so called Purohits spitting gutka in Jagannath temple, Puri 🙂 I guess you prefer pee and poop in the temple premises then........ I really hope if he is a cow.;-) Or maybe they do?! Imagine the power trip pissing on world heritage! The balls of this man /s Welcome to India, don't give special respect just because it is a temple. The people of our country do these things oh so proudly. It can be termed as a cultural thing. In my opinion you can't educate the Indian mass on this, they will agree and then go ahead and do it themselves. You see, our society is a little too hypocritical. No big temple have toilet..puri jagannath temple premise have toilet inside...and also people piss other places where it's restricted to pee Pakka MUSLIM Hai Ye Ganddi Nali Ka Kida 😈 Our trains are shining example of civic sense. The next illogical step would be to get his name thereby his religion, caste, whatever else non sense gets people riled up and hurts their sentiments. While the act is shameful, let the dude relieve himself, he probably is over worked and under paid. No one will get suspended for peeing in public, we are not that accountable for our actions. Bribes are given in broad daylight, on a rainy day and in bitter cold yet one one blinks twice. I guess despite numerous claims on the Internet there aren't enough bhakts in the community Did you just take picture for some internet points or did you report it to some authority? Or did u actually confront him? So its just pee will evaporate. Kesari Gifting nitrogen Mera bhaarat mahaan Is it sarcastic? The security guard would also be odia Saar, what to do saaaar? Urgently susu coming, please adjust saar! _proceeds to police everybody else near the temple unironically_ Your username makes me think otherwise. Action should be taken against violators, not against the sanctity & protocol of a religious place. Recently visited this site and realised that it must be conserved for much much longer for constantly reminding people about the magnificent structures or Indian heritage. wtf bruh Not having a toilet where a security guard has to work is a shame. But at the same time they need to have two security guards so that they can take turn to walk 10 mins(just a guess) to the nearest toilet. What action should be taken..!? That's crazy! It's not like India is known for shitting in the street or anything Where's the proof for that? It's amazing how much you people are brainwashed and to the point you just defame it being a Muslim doing so. Why? Can your people never stand and pee? Pee-swaguru Come on just get a toilet or just do it in a bush, but not to something which is heritage Hefty fine, make him clean on his own, shame him.... Someone's getting fired He's just marking his territory. Protocol that religious places should not have washroom hai😑 Woh Surya devta hai. Konark is his and so he will. What a snitch. They don't know whom to choose Why the duck there is not even a single news article about it on entire Google. Is it a fake news ? Any link please Ewww low class people Bro you can't live your life without talking Hindu-Muslim huh?? Touch some grass for fck sake we have the most uncultured society in the world * on a public site Are you sure the security guard hasn't peed on that grass you just touched? Yup it does evaporate I have tried on both mosque and church. Jerking off to sexy sculpture are amazing as a muslim I don't have any sculpture but thanks to AI I can generate md profit and aeyasha not sure if it's legal but I enjoyed. I have farted in mosques had no issue there not sure how temples work. No attar to the rescue. Before all of us start getting angry, what us the veracity of this photo ? You're a sarakchhap first, nobody doubts that. I saw him and took this photo myself. So I guess the question is whether you believe me or not. But I have no reason to lie. I was really frustrated to see this happening. It is frustrating yes and I'm not doubting your intention or your reaction. It's just that the internet is inundated with mismatched pics and info. And we end up being angry over false stories than facts. And that ultimately creates divides people. I wasn't asking because I doubt you. I was just checking up to see that we (rightfully) are enraged at a proper reason. It's important to rage and talk about the things you dislike. It's just that we should make sure we are not censoring or spinning facts. Since you clicked it yourself, I believe you💫 I'd have slapped the shit Outta him!! And then ensured that he got fired! Then build a wash room for him nearby. Rakshak bana Bhakshak can the be reported to the authorities !! nosense It will be better to make a toiler nearby"
