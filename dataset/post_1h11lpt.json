The GST Council has categorized food items into different tax slabs, ranging from 0% to 28%.In this case, the 5% GST rate applicable to OFFEE WORLD likely pertains to the supply of food and beverages, such as coffee, that are not served in a restaurant or are sold as takeaways. On the other hand, KEVENTERS, being a restaurant or an eatery, attracts a higher GST rate of 18% for its products, such as waffles, shakes, and sundaes.The barista's explanation that the GST rate varies with the product is accurate. Different products have different GST rates. For instance, food items like milkshakes and sundaes may attract a higher GST rate, while packaged food items like cookies or chocolates may attract a lower rate.",

        ">Coffee has a GST of 5% while ice cream has a GST of 18%, hence your bills have different rates.\n\nThe difference lies in whether the food is freshly prepared or it is pre-made. Freshly made food means it is a restaurant, and restaurants have 5% GST with no input credit available. Ice cream is pre-made in a factory and just sold in the outlet / shop. So 18% GST is applicable on it, with input credit available.",

Restaurants have two options for gst filing , one is flat 5 percent on all the transactions but you canâ€™t claim any gst returns and in the other the items have varied gst rates where you can file gst returns since this is more complicated most of the small restaurants go for the flat rate . But big chains go for the latter model since they file gst returns and in turn is more profitable . Pleasure pe tax jyada lagta hai.. laate khaane waalon pe sarkar taras kar leti hai.. Anything that is made in house(coffee in this case) is classified as restaurant service attracting 5% gst and anything that is packaged or manufactured in a standardised way (ice cream) is classified as a good with a varied rate depending on its HSN We regular people with our simple brains simply can't fathom the the complexities and reasons why a great person like nimmi ji made such a decision. Just do as asked, no questions. Lol Not surprising, the MLA will give themselves tons of benefits including wage increase to accommodate the cost of living but when it comes to the public, you bet it's never gonna happen. I have had hope that people would revolt but there is no way it's gonna happen as the rich keeps on getting more power and control over the population with technology. You mean Nirmala forced him to apologize and recorded and released the video online ? non-ac restaurants charge 5% gst and ac restaurants charge 18% gst. Maybe that could be the case. Was the other one non-ac *Main to ice cream nahi khaati jeeeee* Don't forget the GST on Health Insurance is 18% No. All 36 goes to the government one way or the other. What are you even saying above man? bro let me explain you how gst works for a resraurant owner so when they cross the turnover limit of 20 lakhs they have 2 options of gst to opt for either 5% or 18% but when you chose 5% you get no itc(input tax credit) basically get to cut off the amount of gst he paid while purchasing under the restaurant name where gst is applied but with 5% you get no itc meaning you have to pay your entire 5% gst GST on cars below 4 meters is 28%, however if the car is more than 4 meters long then GST is 40% if I'm not wrong. And Nirmala is not even elected. She is from Rajya Sabha. Hence, the farty attitude. The GST rates for restaurants serving food and beverages are 5% for non-air-conditioned restaurants and 18% for air-conditioned restaurants. Additionally, the GST rate is 18% for restaurants serving alcoholic beverages I wish to do so though, only if weren't getting this costly while at the same time also having shirnkflation yup GST varies on car types. for ev i guess it is 5% but i am saying in general. yup GST varies on car types. for ev i guess it is 5% but i am saying in general. eh just the same doesn't change the fact that the elected ones aren't any better I think OP is asking *how* does it work, i.e. based on what frameworks does the Finance Ministry decide these slabs? GST on ice creams is 18%(specifically ice creams), whereas coffee generally comes under food is charged 5% simple as that You don't know me! In life, understand the difference between dal-chawal and biriyani... The EV benefit ends this year. Same rules as normal cars. I've explained as much as I can in a Reddit comment. Please look up on Google how input tax credit works in case you need further understanding. Now some schmuck will come and justify that by saying these are high ticket expenditures so the tax % is supposed to be lower. Point is, only ultra rich can afford these high ticket stuff, plus ALL OF IT IS LUXURY, and they still have tonnes of money to afford it in first place, while the stuff with high tax % are essential goods and the people buying them come from poor families as well. If you're sensible, even a tiny % increase in high ticket luxury expenditures can offset some % decrease on essential goods. But then how will they serve their billionaire underlords and this also helps them with poor as they have to be dependent on the govt, which, they then advertise like they're doing some God's work. You pay 18 GST on input. You pay 18 GST on (36-18). Ultimate the government does get 36. You ultimately paid 36 too. Not technology, religion. Technology just aids to it. I didn't say the government gets less. I simply said that in one case the restaurant pays whole of what it charges from you and in another case it pays part of it. That's the difference between whether or not input tax credit is available. That's it, that was the whole of my point. Nothing with regards to how much the government gets. Coz both are different products and have different rates GST on Coffee is 5% and any other beverage is 18% GST is applied on food items based on different tax slabs. Coffee is taxed lower whereas packed beverages are taxed higher. So this doesn't pertain to outlets but rather the item in question. Yep! Welcome to the Clusterfuck that is GST. We make croissants at a central kitchen and send it to two units - one is a \"bakery\" and the other is a \"restaurant\". At the bakery, we have to charge 18% GST whereas at the restaurant, its a flat 5%. Someone had mentioned that the tax slabs vary because of the nature of the beverage and while that is true, it could also be because of how the establishment is presented to the GST council. Yes But that 5% is on seat sharing helicopter service, not on buying helicopter. Because tax on ice cream is high. Reduce it and see daily consumption sky rocket /s Ya that's why I had written the word normal person in my comment BRB going to get a heli for myself Shit country both. I tried searching, but couldn't find the tax on helicopter purchase. Can you share some link please? [here you go](https://charteredonline.in/gst-on-helicopter-purchase/) The variation in GST rates between OFFEE WORLD and KEVENTERS can be attributed to the different tax slabs applicable to food and beverages in India. The GST Council has categorized food items into different tax slabs, ranging from 0% to 28%.In this case, the 5% GST rate applicable to OFFEE WORLD likely pertains to the supply of food and beverages, such as coffee, that are not served in a restaurant or are sold as takeaways. On the other hand, KEVENTERS, being a restaurant or an eatery, attracts a higher GST rate of 18% for its products, such as waffles, shakes, and sundaes.The barista's explanation that the GST rate varies with the product is accurate. Different products have different GST rates. For instance, food items like milkshakes and sundaes may attract a higher GST rate, while packaged food items like cookies or chocolates may attract a lower rate. XD Thank you so much! >rich keeps on getting more power and control over the population with technology. That is why Ladki Bahin happened? Free money for poor, taken from taxes that are majorly paid by the rich. Because 'rich keeps on getting more power and control' >Coffee has a GST of 5% while ice cream has a GST of 18%, hence your bills have different rates. The difference lies in whether the food is freshly prepared or it is pre-made. Freshly made food means it is a restaurant, and restaurants have 5% GST with no input credit available. Ice cream is pre-made in a factory and just sold in the outlet / shop. So 18% GST is applicable on it, with input credit available. Sanitary pads carry 18% and the loudspeaker used to hide the hike was the pad man movie."
