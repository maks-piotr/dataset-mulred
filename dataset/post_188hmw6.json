OP registered a PRIVATE company, it is in the name, the info is supposed to be private, but in our country, all you need to do is pay MCA a small fee and you will get all their financial records, shareholding pattern, Governance doc, Board of directors etc. It's pathetic.

Investors want protection. If founder does some shady shit/fraud they should be able to use the founders and get restitution which they will not get in India (fraud is rife in Indian startups).\n\nEspecially in fintech, it is important to incorporate in India because RBI is a bitch about regulations(good). \n\nI mean nowadays, incorporating in India is becoming easier so that's why even investors don't care if they are India incorporated or not but pre 2021, that was the case.\n\nWith Zirp and free flow of money, investors just wanted a return.",
        "Ouch, im stuck between a rock and a hard.\n\nWish I registered it in Delaware (currently im on a two month US stay at my brothers house) \n\nBut like you said financial regulators would not allow outside companies to operate in areas like say mutual fund/insurance commissions on sales through the app etc etc\n\nRight? \n\nSo what would you suggest? \n\nSliding into your DM!",

What do you think Bloomberg terminal is so precious if such information was already public?\n\n\n>In most countries, basic info of all company is publicly available\n\nNo, it's not and it shouldn't be. You shouldn't be able to view what is the shareholding pattern, governance docs, board of directors etc of a private company because it shouldn't be anyone's business except the shareholders of the private company to know such details. Look at companies in USA or even Europe. You register a Delaware LLC or C-corp in those jurisdiction, you will never get any info from them unless you need those for a lawsuit and subpeona those details from the registrar.\n\nBy your logic, it should be easy to know holdings of top Private Equity companies of the world, but we don't because they are all privately operated. You have a weird definition of what private and public means. Private doesn't ONLY mean that its shares are private, it's financials, everything is supposed to be private which is not the case in India. \n\nI am not bitching, I am stating facts.",

Yes you are right, the title should rather have been clearer By Privacy I mean giving private space and not intruding my space and spamming me relentlessly‚Ä¶ Thank you for the suggestion to keep track of spam too (hard pass for now since spammed by hundreds of emails now) Also thank you for your wishes! :) What you‚Äôre not realising is that the email address you provided while registering your company is publicly listed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Nobody sold your details, it is publicly available, and you agreed to the same. These entities are simply taking advantage of that fact. It's by design in our country. Anyone can access any private company's financial records by just paying a small fee. That's why I like how Delaware incorporates its companies, they will never give away your details unless court ordered for some lawsuit. If you have a Delaware LLC registered, nobody will know who are the the shareholders/LPs. Bro! OP registered a PRIVATE company, it is in the name, the info is supposed to be private, but in our country, all you need to do is pay MCA a small fee and you will get all their financial records, shareholding pattern, Governance doc, Board of directors etc. It's pathetic. It shouldn't be possible to access private companies info. But, here we are, where even the govt itself encourages it. Lol. I mean we can't do anything about it except register in Delware if it is a tech company. Yes thats the sad design‚Ä¶ Yeah I read about delaware and some other EU countries for digital nomad and stuff like that.. The startup intends to develop a product for stock market to automate parts of the investing process and tracking the markets etc and bringing transparency to the forefront like what criminal cases a ceo or a promoter has or some financial irregularities red flags caught by our algorithms.. So because of the sensitiveness of the nature of the product/company i wanted to incorporate somewhere where it is absolutely confidential but my co founder wanted us to be transparent first without hiding and all or else why will others trust us? Also we would need to fundraise so I believe that confidentiality is not possible or is it? Do you know or have any idea if you can incorporate and run fully confidentially and also do fund raise (investors like VCs PEs ) ?? Ive worked in a small finance firm and we often give our phone numbers while doing start-up and MSME registration process of client‚Äôs companies and then change them later on for ease of processing. The number of spam calls i get from random consultants is too damn high. Investors usually prefer if your company is registered in Delaware or Singapore because they know that law is followed there( you can keep on harping that oh we have laws here, blah blah, we don't). Investors want protection. If founder does some shady shit/fraud they should be able to use the founders and get restitution which they will not get in India (fraud is rife in Indian startups). Especially in fintech, it is important to incorporate in India because RBI is a bitch about regulations(good). I mean nowadays, incorporating in India is becoming easier so that's why even investors don't care if they are India incorporated or not but pre 2021, that was the case. With Zirp and free flow of money, investors just wanted a return. Ouch, im stuck between a rock and a hard. Wish I registered it in Delaware (currently im on a two month US stay at my brothers house) But like you said financial regulators would not allow outside companies to operate in areas like say mutual fund/insurance commissions on sales through the app etc etc Right? So what would you suggest? Sliding into your DM! Some stories just don‚Äôt get enough media attention, so most people don‚Äôt get to know such things. I also started my business and my email is flooded with spams. Also personal details are available on internet. Does anyone know how to take down our info from sites like zaubacorp and others. Haha! I just started out a restaurant and all of a sudden all my feed is full of Sanjiv Kapoor restaurant courses and secrets to business and what not üòÇ just curious how much it costs to register a startup. and maintaining it. Lol! you're funny man. T0 begin with, You should google the difference between private and public ltd company. By the way its crime and the company owners can be jailed for hiding their financial records, shareholding pattern, Governance doc, Board of director. Difference in private company and public company is about the ownership of shares. Private company doesn't mean the info of ownership shouldn't be private. In most countries, basic info of all company is publicly available. You are bitching about the wrong thing. You're getting downvoted because of your attitude and demeanor. Everyone gets spam calls, messages, emails etc GLOBALLY. India does lack a lot when compared to first world countries, but spammers and scammers don't discriminate and treat every country alike! (sarcasm) >Difference in private company and public company is about the ownership of shares. Absolutely true. I never said it is not. >Private company doesn't mean the info of ownership shouldn't be private. Yes, it should be! What are you talking about? What do you think Bloomberg terminal is so precious if such information was already public? >In most countries, basic info of all company is publicly available No, it's not and it shouldn't be. You shouldn't be able to view what is the shareholding pattern, governance docs, board of directors etc of a private company because it shouldn't be anyone's business except the shareholders of the private company to know such details. Look at companies in USA or even Europe. You register a Delaware LLC or C-corp in those jurisdiction, you will never get any info from them unless you need those for a lawsuit and subpeona those details from the registrar. By your logic, it should be easy to know holdings of top Private Equity companies of the world, but we don't because they are all privately operated. You have a weird definition of what private and public means. Private doesn't ONLY mean that its shares are private, it's financials, everything is supposed to be private which is not the case in India. I am not bitching, I am stating facts. only in some states in USA and some countries in Europe you get that privacy for companies because that's their whole USP. Rest of states/countries make info available in public to encourage transparency in economy. Do iPhones/Macs offer better privacy in india than android/windows? Take a chill pill please. This isn‚Äôt specific to India. Even in the USA, once you form an LLC, your data gets exposed and you start receiving a lot of marketing mail. You might consider this spam and others might not. From what you talk about to what you watch. Everything is tracked. Yeah I get it but i got downvoted because i told my company wouldn‚Äôt do so‚Ä¶.its beyond me‚Ä¶ :/ You may want to try ‚Äúincogni‚Äù Privacy is a joke in the entire world. You ain't ever gonna cold email/cold call your prospects? Good luck scaling your business. And what does any of this have to do with \"this country\"? Cribs about privacy issues, goes on to post somebody else's whatsapp number on Social media without consent."
