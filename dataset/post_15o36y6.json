If centre is really envision the welfare of all languages , they would releases schemes or name them in different languages to make it unique and also respect other languages.

        "What is even sadder is they'll get away with this, no matter who comes up in power next time because this is not just a BJP-right wing thing. INC started this back in late 1930's. Ever since then Hindi has been given undue importance in non-Hindi speaking states at the cost of indirectly marginalizing  other regional languages for several decades . \n\nAt the end of the day political parties at the centre will push for Hindi whether it be right or left wing or at the least no one is going to revert things to prioritize diversity or switch to a language of ease of understanding. The majority wants the majority rule and everyone and everything is second class.",

Having a national language removes the barrier between people and makes the bond stronger and more firm but now that we did not do it for 70+ years, its not necessary anymore.

Now that we have a robust national identity it's time to roll Hindi back. If their political base shouts for it, they'll do it.\n\nThey're politicians.

        "Let me introduce you to Article 351 of the Indian Constitution which makes Promotion of Hindi duty of the Union Government.\n\nhttps://indiankanoon.org/doc/1581449/\n\n>Directive for development of the Hindi language \n\n>It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages",
        "So, right now, in the IPC, r*pe is defined in Section 376. It only recognises man as the rapist and the woman as the victim. This section doesn't apply if the man and woman are married. The penalty for violence under this can go up to death penalty in rare cases. \n\nIPC 377 applies in unnatural sex: man having oral sex with man, man having anal sex with man, man having anal sex with wife. Before 2018, it used to apply on consensual sex cases where both capes get punished if it was consensual and only the rapist if it was non-consensual.\n\nSince 2018, consensual sex under 377 is no longer illegal. So right now, 377 applies in man on man r*pe cases. It is the only law that accepts a man can be victim of r*pe. Marital rape cases where man r*pes his wife 'unnaturally' a.k.a anal sex is also filed under S. 377. It is sort of a loophole to get justice for married women since marital r*pe law doesn't exist. \n\nAmit Shah's Bill to replace the IPC doesn't have 377. So if it passes, man on man r*pe will stop being illegal.\n\nP.S: One can argue that the generic law of section 131 might apply in absence of 377. I am not sure that it will but even if it does penalty of 'unnatural' r*pe is ten years to life imprisonment while in section 131 the maximum is two years. \n\nHence this Bill removes the only protection that men can use if sexual crimes happen to them.",

And problem is not of learning, but ego and some superiority. \n\nKeep speaking different languages and rely on foreign language to cross communicate. Eventually all the legacy languages will go away and only English will remain for you guys in few generations. \n\nNorth Indians who are united by Hindi don't need a foreign language to rely on.",
        "Hindi killed off many smaller languages across North India than any South Indian language ever did. Stop talking out of your ass and educate yourself about what has happened since independence.\n\nMost South Indians, at least sensible ones, do not view any language as superior or inferior to others.

But when the date arrived the movement started again and finally it was decided to create the barrier of hindi and non-hindi forever and ever or you can say until India becomes advance enough to completely switch to English. Your example of Pakistan and Sri Lanka are wrong, yes language was one way but it was not the major reason. \n\nNothing will happen, if we implement English as the national language of the country except for politicians barking bullshit.

    "light_cleaned_title": "[RANT] Fed up and disgusted by Hindification of central Laws/Schemes",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Every passing parliamentary session , we are seeing slow hindification of all laws/schemes. There is utter disrespect to other languages of India. Recent one : > The IPC will be replaced by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. The CrPC of 1973 will be replaced by the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 will be replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, 2023. -[from Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-august-11-2023/article67183124.ece) All states should vehimently oppose this and in todays worlds its not that difficult to name the scheme/law in English and publish the same in literally all world languages. I am not against hindi , but all i am asking is why alone hindi is prioritised? If centre is really envision the welfare of all languages , they would releases schemes or name them in different languages to make it unique and also respect other languages. Just like how we [name the cyclones in indian ocean and bay of bengal...](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1619051)",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Yes. It's super irritating. Let's rename all of these in local languages. To a layman, which one is more decipherable, “Indian penal code “ or “bharatiya nyaya sanhita” Hindi is prioritised cause after independence it was decided that the official language of India i.e Bharat will be Hindi and English will be used for time being to enable smooth switch over to Hindi BUT when the deadline came a protested was started that south will not accept Hindi, so a final decision was made to use a third language as the mode of communication in the nation between Hindi and non-Hindi speaking states. Creating this boundary of communication which invisibly cuts off Hindi speaking states with the non-hindi speaking states. Is it important for a nation to have a national language yes.... is it necessary no I would advice to take turns in naming the schemes. The names are as much irrelevant to me whether its in hindi or bengali or punjabi etc , but atleast this way i would be very happy , all \"Indian\" Languages are given equal importance. இந்திய தண்டனை சட்டம் in that case , which language should be go for ? The language of the land ? or one which came from migration ? Indian penal code. funny how only hindi speaking states are bothered by this.why do you think everyone else should be catered to you only? there are more non-hindi speaking states than hindi speaking states. And don't forget the super irritating ITR Acknowledgement Forms with the first few pages in Hindi. Hate that shit. > Is it important for a nation to have a national language yes. this works if your country is homogenous with a single cultural identity. language and its variants are one of the most basic aspects of a culture, by imposing other language, you are imposing other cultural values and this is not taken too kindly. [one of the reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language_movement) for east pakistan to become bangladesh was imposition of urdu over bengali. >Is it important for a nation to have a national language yes I don't think so. Countries like UK don't have a national language even though they can make English as one. And of u want to make a language it should a language which is considered 1st language by atleast 75% of the nation. Which is not the case with India. Not all laymen know Hindi. Also they will have vernacular words for the law anyway. If you're at a position where you need to know those words, you will probably know English too. BJP will be routed in the South in 2024, irrespective of the result in rest of India. If BJP wins in 2024 the vindictive and petty Gujarati duo will make life of Southerners hell. Indian Penal Code As I said by the previous representatives who decided a lot of things about the nation, came to the conclusion of using Hindi. If we wish to use the language of the land that would mean everyone will need to start speaking the language of the North Sentinels, the purest Indians by gene, every other language spoken today is a migrant language. What is even sadder is they'll get away with this, no matter who comes up in power next time because this is not just a BJP-right wing thing. INC started this back in late 1930's. Ever since then Hindi has been given undue importance in non-Hindi speaking states at the cost of indirectly marginalizing other regional languages for several decades . At the end of the day political parties at the centre will push for Hindi whether it be right or left wing or at the least no one is going to revert things to prioritize diversity or switch to a language of ease of understanding. The majority wants the majority rule and everyone and everything is second class. That's why I said its not necessary but important. Having a national language removes the barrier between people and makes the bond stronger and more firm but now that we did not do it for 70+ years, its not necessary anymore. With passing time, English will become the language of the land and every other will be replaced, considering that life on earth remains long enough that India can attain its peak growth. It's not like INC is some Hindi-speaking illuminati. During/post-independence they tried various things for creating a national identity. Now that we have a robust national identity it's time to roll Hindi back. If their political base shouts for it, they'll do it. They're politicians. The main benefit, and main problem, of politicians is that they can throw away their ideology in their chase for votes. I'm literally going ROFL. Less than 10% know English man , English isn’t some peasant friendly language as of today I repeat: after this Bill passes, male victims of sexual assault will have no law left. Indian law doesn't recognise women can be perpetrators of r*pe under 376. But if a man r*pes a man, there is a penalty of ten years to life imprisonment under 377 right now. If this passes, that will go. But because it is a niche issue, this will get lost over issues that appeal to a larger audience like language. P.S: I know 377 was not written to protect men, but that's what it does now: protects men and married women who can't file marital rape under 376. Wait till you find out what's gonna happen in 2026 Because only sanskrit good. All other languages are dirty and needs to be eliminated. Yes but with time a nation will always need to decide a common language of communication throughout its land, you cannot govern a nation if a person 800 km away can not understand what you are speaking. And at the same time, Language was also the reason why Bengali speaking people united against the Filthy urdu speaking genocidal pakistani army, thereby uniting people of east bengal. To implement a national language you need to integrate the people together so they get exposed to each others language more and more often and there by diluting there stand, followed by which what ever the language the gets considered as the national language can be implemented. >makes the bond stronger and more firm If the govt notices sent to my home are in my mother tongue, only then I'll feel the stronger bond. >English will become the language of the land No. Our mothertongues will always stay as the language of the land until some bad happens. Bad from outside disrupts. Bullshit > a common language of communication it is already there, it is English. > you need to integrate the people together exactly, imposing a language which is not their own is differentiating not integrating. perhaps they should introduce south indian languages in the cow belt, how is that for integration? That's be great but how do we do that? Rename law and schemes? Remove the third language from nameboards? Stop schools from teaching Hindi in non-Hindi states? Hypnotize people into forgetting this govt. sponsored undue influence? Ask national leaders to not use Hindi at world conferences? This is not something that can be walked back. I've been to European countries where native people were taken back when they realize i don't speak Hindi, they just give a blank stare and can't comprehend why i an Indian can't speak the supposed national language. That's the damage that has been done. Of course it's not their fault for the growing soft power that govt. projects by pushing Hindi as defacto at various international summits. funny how ignorant you are, the topic was brought up constituent assembly and the first one to refuse the national language was the southern states and not the north. Sorry, I'm a layperson. Law, in practice, is not meant to be peasant friendly. That is why you hire a lawyer. Could you elaborate? What I gathered is this law would give men the right to file a complaint against sexual assault against them? ଭାରତୀୟ ଦଣ୍ଡ ସଂହିତା | &#x200B; >discussion on national language of india I got no issue with that there needs to be a national language that's my point... Hindi/Sanskrit/Hindustani/Tamil/Gujrati/Bengali which gets picked up as the national language is not my point. Bullshit your state of mind That's not hindification, it's Sanskritisation. And the reality is no one speaks Sanskrit these days. It not wont, the more India will develop with time and get globalised the lesser important state languages will become considering over a larger period of time and not the next decade. >when they realize i don't speak Hindi, they just give a blank stare and can't comprehend why i an Indian can't speak the supposed national language. That's the damage that has been done. Of course it's not their fault for the growing soft power that govt. projects by pushing Hindi as defacto at various international summits. I think its not only that govt *pushed* Hindi projects. It is also difficult for them to understand or more like relate that one nation can have so many languages and that there is not one main language per se. Additionally, bollywood had huge impact as well. > Rename law and schemes? Yes. > Remove the third language from nameboards? Ehh... situational. > Magically bring back the small regional language that have been forgotten by Hindi's influence? Has been done before. For example, revival of Hebrew. (Look up Eliezer Ben-Yehuda.) > Stop schools from teaching Hindi in non-Hindi states? Absolutely - or rather, make them prioritize the loca language and let Hindi be the third language. So, it's better to follow whatever is easy for globalisation. English it is. 😬 So, it's better to follow whatever is easy for globalisation. English it is. 😬 Ah yes Bollywood is the other culprit that rarely embraces other Indian languages. Having grown up watching ton of American movies i've learnt quite a few Spanish words because Hollywood gives at least some importance to Mexican characters and language. Same can't be said for our film industry. Let me introduce you to Article 351 of the Indian Constitution which makes Promotion of Hindi duty of the Union Government. >Directive for development of the Hindi language >It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages So, right now, in the IPC, r*pe is defined in Section 376. It only recognises man as the rapist and the woman as the victim. This section doesn't apply if the man and woman are married. The penalty for violence under this can go up to death penalty in rare cases. IPC 377 applies in unnatural sex: man having oral sex with man, man having anal sex with man, man having anal sex with wife. Before 2018, it used to apply on consensual sex cases where both capes get punished if it was consensual and only the rapist if it was non-consensual. Since 2018, consensual sex under 377 is no longer illegal. So right now, 377 applies in man on man r*pe cases. It is the only law that accepts a man can be victim of r*pe. Marital rape cases where man r*pes his wife 'unnaturally' a.k.a anal sex is also filed under S. 377. It is sort of a loophole to get justice for married women since marital r*pe law doesn't exist. Amit Shah's Bill to replace the IPC doesn't have 377. So if it passes, man on man r*pe will stop being illegal. P.S: One can argue that the generic law of section 131 might apply in absence of 377. I am not sure that it will but even if it does penalty of 'unnatural' r*pe is ten years to life imprisonment while in section 131 the maximum is two years. Hence this Bill removes the only protection that men can use if sexual crimes happen to them. Unrelated, is there any reason you're censoring the word rape? >Ah yes Bollywood is the other culprit that rarely embraces other Indian languages. I dont think you want bollywood to represent people who speak other languages. Did you forget Chennai express? I explained to some people how BJP reduced the penalty for r*pe if victim is transgender to maximum two years in 2019 on another thread and my comment got hidden for some reason hence the censoring. Hindi is a local language too. The unfortunate subtext here is that there is a \"national language\" and the rest are subordinate \"regional languages\". if you read my original comment I said it clearly its important to have a national language but not necessary and the para above it is how the language debated ended in our country (in short) but people are people and got offended India (that is Bharat) was founded by Hindi supremacists lol. The amount of hate to Hindi I see here is deplorable. The right ask is to provide mandatory legal copies in all prominent languages. I feel proud that at least north Indian states understand one language. Go to a south Indian state and fuck your mind with new language in every state with no common language at all. how does that refute what i am saying? the topic is always brought up by hindi supremacists and rejected by the rest. the non-hindi states aren't really concerned with the lack of national language like the hindi states are. they are all happy with their regional language and english being used as a link language. Bharatiya nyaya samhita is translated into.malayalam as .. err.. Bharatiya nyaya samhita. Doh. About half of the languages would also have the same wording. Also this is a Union govt bill and Union is constitution-bound to promote Hindi. If you'd care to be objective, you'd notice that for a pro-Hindi party like BJP with a thumping majority and zero restraint about other core matters like Ram temple and Article 370, they've been uncharacteristically lackluster about pushing for Hindi over the past 9 years besides the occasional mention. There's English which is a language that can be used for the same purpose you're stating. There's also the added benefit of it being the language that can open many doors outside India as well - look at how much we emigrate to other countries. Stupid fucks in cow belt want others to learn Hindi so that they can comfortably move to other states? Move to France -learn French, not the other way around. The new laws have nothing to do with the promotion of Hindi. If the govt wants to promote Hindi it can incentivise people to learn the language. Or even promote Hindi literature etc etc. There are a million different ways to develop the language, and none of them involve imposing a language on people. Further, Art 351 doesn't mandate that everything in India has to be in Hindi. There is a common language. You are speaking in it. >it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India Sounds like imposition to me. What is going to happen? You are against Hindi that's why you have problems with Bhartiya Nyaya sanhita.. All of these words mean the same in Kannada as in Hindi. People like you ☕ I am glad we have people like you still with us to remind why Britishers ruled 400 years on us. Opposition only have 2 thing to do now a days divide on the basis of language and divide on the basis of caste. ?! Am I missing something? I genuinely don’t know i feel like i'm missing something too Kamaal hai. The same south that they praise for the preservation of culture and heritage will be subjected to torment because they didn't vote them. FIFA World Cup? Lol I cannot believe how stupid all of the south indians are if this is what it is. All the languages in south India are older than English, have a great history and legacy behind each. But when it comes to unity, a foreign dialect is required because apparently speaking another south Indian language itself is a problem, forget Hindi. And problem is not of learning, but ego and some superiority. Keep speaking different languages and rely on foreign language to cross communicate. Eventually all the legacy languages will go away and only English will remain for you guys in few generations. North Indians who are united by Hindi don't need a foreign language to rely on. Hindi killed off many smaller languages across North India than any South Indian language ever did. Stop talking out of your ass and educate yourself about what has happened since independence. Most South Indians, at least sensible ones, do not view any language as superior or inferior to others. If we do not speak each other's language, we default to English, which is just a tool of convenience. Not our identity. Why do you think people are united only when they speak a common language? This is the whole pile of shit you have in your head. What is in these new laws? Don’t underestimate the vindictive Gujju duo. They’re holding back MNREGA payments for WB for the past 2 years citing corruption cases 🙄 they refused to sell rice Karnataka that they’re struggling to sell at lower price in the market. That’s for Assembly elections. Imagine if they get spanked in LS, how vindictive they’ll act then. This underlines the problem. If they had respect for other cultures we could expect better from them but alas not. >This underlines the problem. If they had respect for other cultures we could expect better from them but alas not. In our most cult movie DDLJ, SRK throws bra at Kajol to flirt with her and harrases her, I dont see bollywood showing respect to anyone. No, the kind of promotion that Art 351 is talking about is - celebrating Hindi Divas, having a department of official languages, commemorating literary achievements, and things like that. It's about broadening the scope of the language. Back in the 50's Hindi's vocab was limited. eg, a lot of technical stuff in science and math didn't have Hindi equivalents. So they are only talking about the development of the language to make it relevant to the 20th century and later. Delimitation 🦜 India doesn't have a national language. Hindi is erroneously considered as the national language when we don't even have one Non Hindia will become colonies. Aka delimitation New constituencies are going to be made, basically rewarding states with high-birth rates and low education - which are all of course in the North. Long term the south will become electorally less significant, allowing parties like BJP to hold on to power through the cow belt alone. Not if they lose the majority. That's the only thing that can save our democracy now. They may not lose but it's crucial that they don't win majority and are forced to put up with the opposition. I suppose this is just speculation? And why 2026 specifically? The way it was stated, it sounded like some significant, pre-planned event. The government certainly plans to carry out the delimitation exercise in 2026. Now of course things can change by then, but this is an announcement by BJP, not just speculation. Don't mind me. I am just working on a list. Thanks to current government, we know have: * LTCG tax * confusing GST (which some states are not getting their share of on time) * 30% tax on crypto gains with no consideration for losses * debt funds that are now less profitable. Long term capital gains from debt removed. All capital gains from debt & International equity to be at slab rate. * reduced interest rate on PPFs * no safe investment that can beat inflation forcing us to take riskier investments * GST on health insurance premium * Poor health spending and worse - tax money being wasted on quackery like AYUSH and AYUSH quacks who now can sneak into medical hospitals + AYUSH visa **<NEW!>** * demonetisation which even the govt doesn't talk about * sky high fuel prices and general cost of living * unemployment. * 20% TCS on foreign investments * Alleged stock market fraud by crony capitalist not being investigated. * Newly imposed limits on EPF contributions and the accrued interests introduced in Budget 2021 resulting in higher tax on withdrawal before maturity *80C and base slabs unchanged despite high inflation * New Surcharge of 10% on income above 50 Lakhs * New Surcharge for income above ₹1 crore was increased to 15% from 12%. * New Tax regime introduced and made default which is worse than old tax regime for most * Jan Vishwas Bill- lessens punishment on pharma companies that skip on quality. **<NEW!>** * ~~2% GST on private hostel and paying accommodations.~~**<NEW!>**[Law or AAR ruling?] * [Govt restricts import of laptop, tablets and computers with immediate effect](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-restricts-import-laptop-tablets-and-computers-8874367/) **<NEW!>** **For those who don't want to get political, DO NOT READ FURTHER.** * An Aadhaar system that was bulldozed through Parliament as a money bill (??) and was forced on the public with little to no discussion or consensus with regards to privacy and potential government abuse. * PM Cares fund (that the public donated to and government employees had to donate to) which despite the name and government push is NOT a public fund thus not held accountable. * Pegasus scandal * Falling rankings in things like Press Freedom Index * NDA government - No Data Available on things like migrant worker deaths during Covid among other things * FCRA amendment- governments can stop NGOs from using foreign funds e.g. Amnesty International, GreenPeace. Also includes educational institutes like JNU from doing the same. * Electoral bond - you can anonymously donate as much as you like to political parties. * CAA - violates secular principle. Can be disastrous if paired with NCC. * The Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Bill, 2023 (passed within 22 minutes!) that could lead to mass surveillance infrastructure for profiling, targeting, and discrimination against Indian citizens. **<NEW!>** * Introduced amendment to Indian Penal Code (IPC), Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and Indian Evidence Act, which if passed could mean [male victims of sexual assault will have no law left](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/15o36y6/rant_fed_up_and_disgusted_by_hindification_of/jvpxr7c/). Also [\"Acts of Sedition\" which will be more draconian than the existing law.](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/15o2aui/home_minister_introduces_bill_to_amend_indian/jvpk7yx/) **<NEW!>** **Please let me know of any corrections or additions.** I see... Thanks for the explanation! We default to Hindi for our convenience. Nothing against any south Indian language. People are united under many causes and language is one of them. Things come out in Hindi because large pop speaks it and is not divided over it. All I see here is that you guys hate Hindi. Instead of saying please bring content in our language, you say we hate hindi. No wonder even in r/india sub, the only language you can say is English while half of the pop can say things in Hindi and communicate. Even south indians can't use their language anywhere else apart from there own state. It is not hard to see that there is virtually no representation of South India at central level because of this sick mentality. This is the final message from all of us: we don't give a damn about what language you speak but we speak in Hindi. Stop belittling our language. Demand things in your language and we will support it. This same government(or any other) will release each doc in the language you need. But stop showing superiority over something which doesn't mean shit 100km away from your own state. Who is belittling Hindi? Is it belittling or hating Hindi if we want legislation translated to all languages? Or if we don't want Hindi imposed on us? You are 100 percent delusional. Hindi did kill off many regional languages and dialects. When I say Hindi, here I mean people who imposed Hindi on all aspects of life in North India. \"Sick mentality\" The only person who has a sick mentality here is you, my brother. Representation at Central level needs majority of MPs, which is only possible if you have stronghold in populous north states. Language has nothing to do with this. \"Final message\" Lol. \"We don't give a damn\" But you should. We all should. That's the point of the post. Be it Tamil or Pahari or Meitei. Hindi is not the only language in the union. We all speak what we want, but should respect the other languages. You have shown through your words that you don't. \"This govt will release\" wow, thanks for the great promise, Amit Shah. Again, what superiority? Are you high? It is very fucked up coz up until five years ago, the punishment for consensual sex and rape both was ten years to life. The government was very interested in punishing consensual sex then. But now when the law only covers rape, the law doesn't matter and can be forgotten and diluted. We know about Directive principles, idiot. You have no stand quoting that. We also know chaddis literally hate the constitution and will rewrite it at the first chance, like they did JK constitution. So, you can fuck off. Why are you getting so angry man? That much anger is not good for your health. All I am saying is that the government has constitutional justification for promotion of Hindi and I am not seeing opposition attacking those justifications. What has Dravidian parties done to remove such laws from the constitution? Absolutely nothing. It is going to create a Frankenstein monster as Non Hindi states will start using local language in English Script as central government is doing now and pretend that is english It will only divide this country further and make it difficult for non locals especially when migration is happening to South from North >not necessary but important It's like saying 'I like ice cream bit it's disgusting.' India refused to do it cos the day India will make hindi or actually one Indian language a national language rest all language groups will loose their objective of being Indian. India has seen examples of Pakistan when they introduced Urdu as their national language, when Sri Lanka introduced Sinhala as national language. Both examples lead to a civil war in respective country. And funny part is India also supported Bengali and Tamils in the respective wars. We don't even know what will happen when 60%+ Indians will be considered linguistic minority in their own country 💀 Honestly, most Hindi speakers don't care about making Hindi India's national language. The major group demanding making Hindi the national language are those who stand to benefit from it. That mostly includes those who are seeking government jobs and government employees. If competitive examinations for government jobs / national universities etc are held only in Hindi and government job promotions / selections are made on the ability to speak Hindi (if made a national language), native Hindi-speaking speakers stand to benefit immensely. That also explains why many are also opposed to conducting competitive examinations in English. Considering the Hindi-speaking states are BJP's primary voter base, the relentless demand for pandering to its voters. It is political economy for the BJP. Renaming old laws and passing them as new. >southern states and not the north. Obviously they will. And looking at present day senario Marathis, Bengalis, Punjabis, North easter and maybe even Gujuraris, Punjabis and Paharis will be with South. I'm fine with it. Hindus are the majority, get with the fucking program. Why English (latin) script is needed in first place. Souther can use their own scripts. Even I would like to use Modi script instead of Devnagari for Marathi. Or just use Bihar pattern. Bihar has many local language but they chose a non-Vihari language (hindi) for Administration. We will use a non-indian language for Administration if u insist so much. Even though it's not needed in this modern world of digital translators. Or just use Bihar pattern. Bihar has many local language but they chose a non-bihari language (hindi) for Administration. We will use a non-Indian language for Administration if u insist so much. Even though it's not needed in this modern world of digital translators. Governments usually create two versions of bill, English and local language. Using Hindi name in englsh verison of bill was stupid and the south will start doing same thing. Englsh is for the non locals and using local names in bill is only going to confuse them when we should be making things simpler for them There's no corruption in WB? That trend is hardly specific to Hindi. There are many tribal and local languages in that have are dying due to state governments' enforcement of the regional language. That said, I am completely fine with English being used as a common language. It's going to happen anyway regardless of what the government does. Corruption absolutely exists in WB but is WB the only state that has corruption? Did Gujarat stopped getting MNREGA funds due to Morbi Bridge disaster, it was a clear case of poor build quality and corrupt practices, heck a watch company was given the bridge contract. It’s just an example of rampant corruption in all over India but only WB is getting targeted by Union govt and denied rightful compensation citing corruption, while taxing us continuously. >I like ice cream bit it's disgusting yes its like that I never said it needs to be Hindi, it can be any language, if not a language of any state then English. But with time everyone in this country will need to switch and even if everyone doesn't switch in the longer run we will be a country in which all the diverse languages culture will be lost and that's the fate of our nation. India refused to do it cause it was not practically possible to switch to Hindi over night and that's why a future date was decided upon. But when the date arrived the movement started again and finally it was decided to create the barrier of hindi and non-hindi forever and ever or you can say until India becomes advance enough to completely switch to English. Your example of Pakistan and Sri Lanka are wrong, yes language was one way but it was not the major reason. Nothing will happen, if we implement English as the national language of the country except for politicians barking bullshit. I'm in favour of having a national language and it does not mean it needs to be hindi > All the languages in south India are older than English, have a great history and legacy behind each. Why do *any* of those things matter? >North Indians who are united by Hindi hahahaha&hellip; You know, given that you are a native Hindi speaker, you have zero perspective to speak on how other linguistic groups of India view Hindi. If nothing matters, learn and speak hindi. Problem solved :) I wonder how does Gujarati's feel about all this... Nope. > Having grown up watching ton of American movies i've learnt quite a few Spanish words because Hollywood gives at least some importance to Mexican characters and language Mexicans aren’t the only people that speak Spanish. It’s a global language and there are many countries that speak it. There are 50 million Spanish speakers in the US right now. That’s more people than Canada, Australia, and even Spain They speak Spanish in Puerto Rico and it’s a US territory so Puerto Ricans are American citizens. They can freely travel to the US and there’s more Puerto Ricans in the US today than Puerto Rico I live in the US. I’m Asian but I learned to speak Spanish fluently simply because there’s a lot of Spanish speakers here and a lot of jobs pay high if you can also speak Spanish Bollywood is Hindi language cinema though. Just like Kollywood is Tamil cinema, and Tollywood is Telugu cinema etc. The equivalence you're trying to make with Hollywood doesn't make sense because that's *American* cinema and not language based. Hollywood has a large Spanish speaking consumer base in the US and that's why it caters to them. They want to go back to 5000 year old sabhyata where they shit in open spaces instead of toilets. Jai Aryavrat✌️ You are underestimating the spread of hatred via TV & whatsapp. That too when 4 of Top 5 ( PM, Home Minister, Finance Minister, External Affairs Minister and Defence Minister) are not at all good/fluent in Hindi, top 2 speak Gujrati mix Hindi everywhere with 50% wrong pronounciation, next 2 just speak okayish Hindi, only Rajnath Singh speaks good Hindi. Not exactly, though. Read on - …culture of India and to secure its enrichment by **assimilating** ‘without interfering’ with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in **Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule**, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily, on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages. (Here are the languages in the Eighth Schedule - Enriching by assimilating the genius, forms, styles, and expressions used in every Indian language. Not imposition, but assimilation. There’s a difference. It’s talking about a vision for it where it develops into primarily an amalgamation of all Sanskrit-based Indian languages, and also draws on elements from other non-Sanskrit languages as needed. It’s not about throwing Hindi into everything by force. It’s about borrowing things from other languages and integrating it into Hindi to develop a truly ‘Indian’ language. The difference between assimilation and imposition is that of exclusion and inclusion. Article 351 seeks to include, not exclude. On the flip side, we’ll now have fun laws like BS 420 /s Yup noticed that this time.. very annoying. Is it really difficult to provide it in citizens native language ? It's not Hindi it's Sanskrit. Each of the words are directly borrowed from Sanskrit except for Bill. I know Marathi and Gujarati has most of these words and there is a huge chance that these words are in other Indian languages either in its original form of its modified form. So this remanining is not English to Hindi but essentially from English (possibly Latin) to Sanskrit. This is a classic example of the Hindi imposition that infuriates people from non Hindi speaking states. If they wanted to promote Indian languages, they could have used the filing information to locate the state, and sent a translation in the local language of that state. If the intention was to make it friendlier for the taxpayer, they could have just sent the acknowledgement in the same language that the returns were filed in. But no. Hindi. OP missed the class on Sanskrit and how a substantial amount of vocabulary in most of the Indian languages traces its root to Sanskrit more so in administrative and religious context. No one speaks Sanskrit but everyone is reliant on its vast vocabulary. These ancient languages exist because when one is out of words they turn to them. Persian, Sanskrit, Latin, Greek - they provide a vast repository of words. The English name of the changed ones were actually derived from Latin. So Latin to Sanskrit is the actual change. I would most certainly encourage that. Right now the influx of words from Non-Hindi South Indian states has almost died out. Because the constitution mandates delimitation of constituencies after every census. But since 1971 that process has been frozen so as to not punish the southern states and it is valid till 2026. So unless the constitution is amended again ,as has been done from time to time to extend that date, the government will be bound to redraw constituencies based on the latest census. >I am not against hindi I am, majority of India doesn't even speak this language. Why push it? It's not the same as japan or China. English should be encouraged and not this language Hindi is still the language most people understand, as opposed to English. And as you suggested, you can always translate from Hindi to local languages. What would it be called in your language? Just asking. I'm angry because India as we know is getting destroyed from within. The instituitions like courts and media which are supposed to withhold and strengthen it are not doing their jobs and are actually aiding in it's destruction. You should be angry too, because if you're not, then in 20 years there won't be an \"India\". Bruh, I grew up in remote North Eastern India and I have seen terrible shit in my life. We are currently in a far better state than we were in the 90s. >Hindi is still the language most people understand, as opposed to English Wrong, people in South and NE India mostly understand English and people in North mostly understand Hindi, ofcourse there is overlapping with people who understand both, I'm just talking about Eng vs Hindi and which language is understood more popularly and where"
