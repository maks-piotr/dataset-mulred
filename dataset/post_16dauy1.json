Has NIA been investigating any BJP people? \n\nAnd you'll say whichever political party will come in power will do that. Yeah it's true, even the previous government under UPA did that. But under BJP, it has used all these central agencies as a way to settle political scores(I ain't saying people in opposition are complete saints). \n \nsource:https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/cbi-ed-investigation-bjp-leaders-under-agencies-scanner",
        "A state reduced to UT (illegal as far as I understand)\n\nA UT with special status taken over with brute force, the powers of that govt taken away in the face of an unanimous 5 judge constitution bench order within days of the judgement\n\nContinuous operation lotus. With governors and speakers aiding them (SC held that in Maharashtra judgement)\n\nGovernors threatening governor's rule for not replying to letters, sitting on bills which has become the norm \n\nIIMs autonomy diluted without consultation\n\nPolice aiding rapists in cases\n\n\n\nHow many can one count. Attacking opposition ruled states, attacking academic institutions, attacking and pressurizing courts, refusing courts judgements, making the parliament one party business\n\n\nYes RaGa can be better at explaining and reasoning. But a recent article in Indian express talked about why kharge should be the pm face and raga should take organisational charge. \n\nIt pointed out that he doesn't gets into the specific details of running things, policy etc and more of sets the overall tone, something that people see as him not willing to take up a role in any govt.",
        "That farm laws fiasco was the biggest non-democratic thing I saw in last few years. A majority government passed the law. Even Congress had this one in their manifesto. But some political farmers groups from two states literally choked the capital. Government was ready for discussion but they weren't ready to agree on anything other than total abolition of the laws. And India missed yet another chance to revise ancient farm laws.",

        "No they did not. Nowhere near this",
        "Yes, media is manipulated more than before. But let's not act like the freaking congress is the answer.

But fuck the Congress too. They are the reason why Modi is still in power.",
        "There is an entire encyclopedia to write about this. But, I have a feeling this post is not in good faith. Why are you \"super frustrated\" about something you don't understand by your own admission? \n\nIf you are cherry-picking the example of the farm laws I suppose you are well aware of how the laws were passed without any consultation, and all the violence, torture, and humiliation inflicted by the ruling government on the farmers protesting against it. Or did you miss the part where hundreds of farmers died in a period that stretched over a year while the government absolutely ignored them before finally being forced to repeal it before the Punjab elections? \n\nYou don't appear to be very humble about your  ignorance. This is bait.",
        "Again it was no where near as shameless as this govt and yes the level does matter.\n\nIts funny how you blame Congress  for Modi and not Modi himself. I actually blame the people who voted for this govt and those who didn't vote.\n\nSo what is your answer?",
        "I do blame the Congress for Modi. Post Nehru, it's Congress's mishandling of economy and polity that gave rise to BJP. \n\nModi's propaganda is similar to the propaganda for Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. \n\nFinally, Congress's non-stop corruption during UPA 2 paved the way for him. \n\nHeck, Congress even indirectly led to the Kashmiri Pandit pogrom.",

And know that only Punjab and Haryana farmers were so against this. Majority indian farmers were in support or agnostic.\n\nThis farmers protest have done two big damages in India: \n1) No government will touch farming infrastructure for at least 20 years. Indian farmers will remain on MSP - not earning much and not directly catering to Indian needs. \n2) It set up a precedence that a group can blackmail government by choking up the capital and climbing on Red Fort with propaganda flags and banners. It goes both ways. Don't be surprised when people from UP choke up the capital to demand more Parliament seats for bigger population, or religious fanatics asking for religious laws. Yes, passing farm laws by voice votes was undemocratic. But it would have passed any way (with majority government).

        "Come  on  this is almost  economics 101 stuff. Free trade creates more opportunities and growth but it also leads to more exploitation and disparity between the haves and have nots. That is why free trade needs to be and is always  regulated. One of the main jobs of the govt is to put in safe guards to protect the workers from exploitation.\n\nAnd that is where the conflict usually comes, as businesses want free hand to do whatever they want and corrupt govts like ours are happy to oblige.\n\nIn the case of these farm bills, any unbiased person with even an iota of knowledge about them can see that they were designed to benefit the businesses and didn't provide any protection for the farmers. I mean one has to be quite dumb to not understand why no farmers orgs were involved in drafting these bills.\n\nThe whole protest was against not having protection  for farmers in the bills. And if the govt was actually serious about bringing in farm reform they would have listened to farmers' demands. Instead they chose to just drop the bills because the main purpose of benefitting their rich \"friends\" wouldn't have been served then."
