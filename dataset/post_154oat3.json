        "All the engg colleges in bangalore have extremely corrupt administration. Its given when parent university VTU itself is corrupt to the core. Management quota is legitimised and a massive ring. It is an accepted practice to always send every semester paper for re-evaluation because initial marks will always be low, and one has to spend several thousands for that every semester. There was a VC I recall who had faked his class 10 pass certificate and yet was heading such an important post in the state.",
