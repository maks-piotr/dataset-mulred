Women talking back (after being sexually molested/harassed) is the last thing conservative wannabe's tolerate.\n\nAt the same time, I don't think peaceful solutions exist for these kind of situations.\n\nGermany didn't de-nazify just because Hitler died or because they went after the military personnel that had a role in the Holocaust. They methodically weeded out the Nazi sympathizers from the the society at the grass roots level."
