This underscores that the scope of this crisis extends beyond any single country.\n\n**India's Crucial Role**: The lack of clarity on how many Indians are trapped in these scams is deeply troubling. We have a moral obligation to determine the extent of the problem and illuminate this crisis that has remained shrouded in uncertainty for too long.\n\n**Cambodia's Weak Institutions**: While Cambodia's struggle with weak institutions and rule of law has contributed to this crisis, it's crucial to remember that these Chinese Triad-linked criminal networks exploit vulnerable individuals trapped in desperate situations. We must offer support, not condemnation.\n\n**Call for Collaboration**: India must take the initiative in establishing a cooperative task force with Cambodia, Thailand and Laos. A unified approach is essential to trace missing workers, dismantle these networks, and address the root causes of this exploitation.\n\n**Our Responsibility**:\n\n* **Diplomatic Focus:** Urge our government to make this a diplomatic priority, prioritizing transparency and accountability.\n* **Awareness Campaign:** Launch a widespread public awareness campaign to educate job-seekers about the dangers of too-good-to-be-true overseas offers.\n* **Support NGOs:** Support organizations working directly to rescue and rehabilitate victims of these scams.\n\nThis isn't just about protecting our citizens, it is also about demonstrating India's leadership as a force for good in the region.
