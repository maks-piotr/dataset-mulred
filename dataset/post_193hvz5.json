    "selftext": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/marital-and-other-rapes-grossly-underreported/article6524794.ece/amp/\n\nSo basically the article surveyed a ton of women in India and found that husbands were responsible for most crimes against women in India. \n\n(6590+157)/100,000 is about a 7% rape rate rounding up heavily in India. This includes reported and unreported cases, since this is an anonymous survey where women can be honest and likely were honest if you consider the fact that they told the surveryors about their husbands a LOT. If you apply this to the entire population you get about 1.25 million rapes per year, much higher than the 32,000 the government claims. \n\nIn the USA RAINN puts that estimate at 1/5, or 20%. That is 13% higher. Let’s end the stereotype that Indians are rapists now. After all I don’t recall Indians colonizing and raping multiple 3rd world countries unlike cough cough UK back in the 1900s.\n\nIndia is worse for reporting. 1.25M/32000 is about 39. Then we do (100 -y)/y = 39 and x + y = 100 to get an unreported rate x of 97.5%!!! This is shocking Indians need to stand up for themselves.  Other estimates put the unreported rate at 99.1 but this isn’t backed by survey data that is available to me, or includes harassment or stalking which are also disgusting and unacceptable but a far cry from rape. \n\nAdditionally, the United States is MUCH worse for murder as seen with shootings and stabbings. The number of homicides in US and India are similar despite India’s population being 3-4 times larger meaning the homicide rate is roughly 3 times higher in the US which is honestly insane to me. Your chance of dying from murder in US is 1/170. Yes sir/mam, lock your door in America. Drug and gang violence is much worse too, a lot coming from China and Mexico but mainly China. \n\nHuman trafficking is about 1M in US and 8M in India making India worse for human trafficking, even per capita. This is a problem Indians will need to work on, likely implementing mandatory dashcams for all and police investigators at shipyards and private planes, as well as death penalties for human traffickers. \n\nOverall since rape and murder are lower in India I’d say India is safer in terms of violent crime. Now sanitation, disease, corruption, and harassment is a different story. \n\nI like my life in the US since I live in a rich area with many jobs but I would rather live in India than the C, D, or F crime rated places in US. Cheers!",
