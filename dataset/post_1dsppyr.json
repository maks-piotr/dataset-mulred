        "Shameful",
        "Ye video ka link hai kya jisme iss gadhe ne ye bola",
        "You are talking as if TMC doesn't get Hindu votes in WB itself. \n\nAnd INDIA alliance has more to do with defeating a common enemy than having a similar ideology. In WB, INC has been an ally of CPM for quite some time and CPM considers TMC its main rival.",
        "If congress wants to get deep into upper caste and obc vote bank all over India, it can‚Äôt be seen with such parties who are full of Muslims appeasement to a level where they justify violence against women and call Wb a Muslim rashtra. Nah man this is too much.",
        "2024 and they still think they OWN womankind",
        "Ah yes, \"full of muslim appeasement\", said it like a sanghi. \n\nOne leader saying it doesn't mean the entire party is justifying it or shares the same view. \n\nI know TMC has its own share of problems but you're blowing it way out of proportion. Go and check how much Hindu votes TMC gets instead of using this Sanghi argument of \"appeasement\". \n\nYou all criticise BJP for being pro-UC and stuff like that and now you also want INC to follow the same path and cut alliance with a party because of \"Muslim appeasement\". I mean, I won't be surprised if you are a BJP voter given the kind of argument you're using here.",
        "No shame",
        "...\n\n\n\n\nThese idiots brought our India down....",
        "Why were they beating up that woman? Also TMC is a scum party and Bengal is doomed. I'm starting to think maybe bjp might actually be good for them.",
        "Tatti mool congress!",
        "Fuk the sangh, and fuk your false dichotomy. I fully believe in secularism and to me Mamta isn‚Äôt at all behaving like one. Aap ki trh andhbhakti hamse Kisi ke liye nahi hogi, sorry üôè I am not a voter of any party lol. I have my own believes and will vote for whoever party I believe is close to my beliefs. Stop this tribalism of yours, we are not a voter bank but responsible citizens first. I liked how raga described Hinduism today, that‚Äôs how I want Hinduism to be. And I want him to convince uc people of the same as well. What‚Äôs wrong with it? Congress has Gandhiji and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who both had strong congress ideology within them but were deeply religious. So what?",
        "The new bhartiya nyay sanahita what ever adds that bribing for votes is criminal offence then whole TMC should be in jail",
        "Tmc is worse than BJP in West Bengal, they are a joke, thieves party",
        "I'm sorry, andhbhakti? LOL. You just assumed I'm some fan of TMC. I don't root for any political party, that's all. I just hate one and that's BJP. \n\nAnd dude, when did I say anything about religion????? Or Hinduism????? I just called out your argument of appeasement that is mostly used by Sanghis to attack political parties. \n\nZabardasti ka you brought Gandhi and Sardar Patel and religious and congress ideology lol when I wasn't talking about that at all. \n\nAnd I'm a secular too and also an Agnostic, who isn't blinded by religion.\n\nRegardless, my original comment was about you saying INDIA will lose Hindu votes because of TMC. I was saying it's an incredibly flawed argument because Hindus vote for TMC in large numbers in WB. You can check the numbers. BJP has long tried to paint it as an anti-Hindu party but it has failed. \n\nAnd I also mentioned that TMC has its own share of problems, I wasn't praising them lol. And you also know why Muslims vote for TMC in large numbers because you also know what will happen in WB if BJP comes to power. TMC is a problematic party but is clearly the lesser evil when compared to BJP.",
        "Their seat share will rise if they stand up for principles instead of just being not-BJP. This was a one time strategy that worked , I doubt that this coalition would earn more seats in the next election with the same strategy.",
        ".",
        "That‚Äôs why I said na in my original comment I want revival of congress. Yes bjp is the biggest evil but I don‚Äôt want to have another evil in place of bjp. Don‚Äôt get blinded by your hate so much that you aren‚Äôt able to see the reality. Muslims are quite backward both economically and socially, and both bjp and tmc will lead to their further detriment albeit by different means. We need strong pro reform Muslim leader not talibani styled one. We need frontier Gandhi!",
        "They're the same party in different flavors",
        "I'm glad all sides of the political spectrum actually agree on how bad tmc is and should be gone.",
        "Haan toh bhai I'm not against a revival of INC in WB. I never said anything about it, did I? I just mentioned the TMC and losing Hindu votes part. \n\nHate?  Kis cheez ka hate? BJP? Well yeah. I hate them and I'd pick TMC over them anyday and everyday. \n\nAnd I come from a Muslim family myself, so I know what our condition is economically and socially. It's bad. \n\nBut again, the thing is, at the moment, in WB it's only TMC vs BJP. Until and unless, a formidable third party arises, people, especially Muslims will vote for TMC and you know the reason why. \n\nAlso, this leader will get arrested and also suspended by the party. Had it been BJP, you know instead of getting demoted, they'd have promoted such people. That's the difference. Again, I ain't a fan of TMC or Mamata but them over the Sangh anyday.",
        "I think you will also agree that tmc is turning a blind eye towards the violence against Muslim women in West Bengal when we should be fighting for their rights. Imo that‚Äôs full on Muslim appeasement. That‚Äôs all. And as a secular guy I am against it. If congress does the same I will be against them too. Because bjp is playing politics on religion, I am against them too. We have to rise above religion and vote banks and that will start by us being responsible voters. If we criticise tmc, maybe Mamta will learn a lesson and improve. She has to know that the politics of her will have consequences and that INDIA won‚Äôt support such politics, that is how she will improve.",

        "I too apologize if I was rude, I just want upliftment of muslims and it will not happen via what tmc or bjp is doing.
