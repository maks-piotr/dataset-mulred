The benefit of doubt for this allegation are previous incidents from 2015 where BSNL Chennai workforce had been shielding telemarketers in every possible way they can. Additionally the UCC complaints to BSNL often get the response like below\n\n1) Incomplete/Incorrect Info\n2) Misrouted\n3) Not a UCC\n\nIn the current incident the Sender id is BX-BSNLTN and the threat message was sent at 15th November 2023 at Time: 18:11.
