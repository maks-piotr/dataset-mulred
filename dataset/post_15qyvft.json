        "I really wish to know how come so many languages are spoken in India itself if it was culturally united. Scientifically speaking, it takes quite a long time for a whole language to develop, the population speaking it needs to be isolated and flourishing properly for such a complicated thing as language to fully take form in writing and speaking. Indian languages are not just spoken differently but written differently too. How come such numerous complex languages developed in India if the people were united culturally for a very long time. They must have been living isolated from each other for a long time, like hundreds of years. The different language regions are so close by too. It's not just different dialects, these are completely different languages. We all know major parts of china and parts of southeast asia have been united for long and were culturally similar, so they have  various dialects of same language. But not in India.  And till few years back most people didn't even understand each other's languages at all, only after communication and traveling has been made easy in recent times that we understand a bit of other state's languages. Till few years back most regions/states even celebrated their own festivals alone, the festivals were celebrated exclusively by the people of that state speaking that language only. It's only now since recent past that most Indian festivals are celebrated across the Country.\nThe only common language which was there between various states was English because English influenced and imposed their culture on everyone, Like all the other colonies of English. When i Look at any other regions of the world, people who had been unified since prehistoric times , they speak same language or similar dialects.",

        "That's a great point in support, studying of same scriptures and following same religion, i agree. But i feel this cant be a sure evidence, because a lot of different cultures around the world have followed same religion and studied same scriptures, even though they are culturally different. Religion spreads like wildfire across the regions and cultures, take for example any part of the world and any religion. And when it comes to origin of languages then all the semitic languages have a common ancestor, yet people speaking them have been culturally different. Same goes with Indo-aryan languages like sanskrit, they are spoken by completely different cultural groups of asia and Europe. I am not a linguistic, haven't studied comparative language sciences, but i have studied Sanskrit and Arabic and i would like to say that they have such similar grammar! Like very very similar grammar rules and word forms, like none other languages i know. Yet the 2 regions haven't been culturally similar. This also begs the question what do you mean by \"culture\", if by culture you mean it's just the Gods they worship then quite possibly most of the world has been culturally same at some point of time, even arabs were polytheistic and had idols, most world worshipped multiple gods and had idols before christianity. But if by \"culture\" we mean the way people lived day to day, clothes they wore, food they ate, festivals they celebrated, marriage and kinship rules, languages they spoke, their architecture, their likes and dislikes, then it's not hard to say who have been culturally United and who have been culturally dissimilar for long.\nAlso, dont you feel isolation is important for a language to develop because if there is no isolation and population has access to an already spoken language which people understand easily then which person would spend unnecessary time learning something such complex thing as a new language? . And we are speaking about old times when people lived day to day, each daylight hour was important and nightly productive activities were minimal because of lack of facilities. Even today people from developed countries dont care to learn a new language because the alternative mother tongue is available to them and they don't care about other languages, eg in Japan, US, UK, Europe. The various different languages from indo-european languages developed as you said exactly because different population groups got isolated from each other. Of course it's natural given how inter-tribe and inter-population wars were so common. Resources were limited, wars were the go-to means for acquiring more land and resources.\nSorry if it's all jumbled up, i wrote hastily but i hope you get what am trying to say.

        ">GoodLuck with the \"United Kingdoms\" theory, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, belonged to bharat and still do...\n\nThis is why this theory of akhand Bharat sounds out of ordinary. You said they were culturally (not politically ) similar 2000 years ago (lol...might as well return current European nations back to Rome). \n\nIndividuals believing in this theory want Afghanistan, Bangladesh and other nations \"back\" because they were culturally similar 2000 years ago. That means if they they got the chance, they will want it back politically by actually invading and \"reclaiming\" lost land. \n\nThe kings you have selected have all fought against each to spread their influence. Sure they had their harmonic days, but they surely had their war days too. \n\nRaja Raja chola: fought against Chalukya dynasty (another empire within present day India) to implement his empire. \n\nRajendra chola: fought against Western Chalukya Empire and helped reached his father's (above) ambitions to it's Zenith. \n\nBappa Rawal: a vassal of the Mori ruler Manuraja decided to set his differences aside and joined the anti Arab confederacy to fend of Arabs invasion from north. \n\nPrithviraj Singh Chouhan: Noted for defeating Chandelas (small kingdom of its own). Also set apart his differences and joined the rajput princes to take on the Ghurid army. \n\nAnd finally, Sivaji: he was one king you can credit by spending most of his time fending off \"foreign\" invaders despite having conflicts and later defeating his half brother (and his army). \n\nSo yes...all these kings you listed had their empires/kingdoms which did get  into conflicts with other smaller regional empires/kingdoms within the akhand Bharat borders who shared common cultural values.\n\nThey became \"united\" time to time when it came to foreign invaders. Some of them even sided with foreign invaders as well to have an upper hand over their regional rivals (who btw shared those common cultural/religious values). \n\nConflicts between those kings/rulers/princes remained. Bharat was in conflict despite having its moments of harmony too. Empires came, and vanished and then came again and vanished...until the foreign forces showed up. And when they showed up, Bharat (the landscape) still fought among itself, sometimes even partnering with foreign forces. \n\nIt was all about power no matter where these kings came from (Afghanistan or core India). \n\nThe only thing that you can stand on about akhand Bharat map is the fact that Hinduism (that too forms of it) spread throughout that region.  \n\nAnd the other thing I can agree on is that British weren't here to unite India, but rather seek division (divide and conquer).",

And yet, In the name of secularism we still are repeating the same mistakes...\n\nWith the idea of akhand bharat, which seems impossible to many..

        ">which still wants further division or partition..\n\nWell currently people are too focused on religious divide, rather than talking about unity over INDIA. \n\n>India has already done away with 1/3rd of its land through partition, All of them which are now currently islamic. And yet, In the name of secularism we still are repeating the same mistakes...\n\nPakistan and Bangladesh if that is what you mean. Afghanistan does not see Indians eye to eye. They consider themselves a Steppe people. Matter of fact, Turks occasionally try to claim Afghanistan...turks also have a andh Baharat concept of their own. So do Persians. So do Russians, Israelis, so did Nazi Germany..now it's India. \n\nAnd yes secularism is crucial for India's success. India is made up of various large tribes of people (like always). People argue what about the Hindus of Pakistan? That doesn't mean we start treating minorities like shit too. That's an illogical argument. It will take India back to terrible turmoil actually. So we have to follow through with this. \n\nMy problem is with the nationalist religiously driven individuals of India. If they get the opportunity, they will rip the constitution apart. \n\n\n>With the idea of akhand bharat, which seems impossible to many.. Atleast the woke shitheads will realise their true history and heritage and potentially change their mindsets about single sided \"brotherhood\" which they call secularism..\n\nIt will remain impossible if followers of akhand Bharat start discriminating towards people who don't agree with them. Sorry man, I see a stroke of Nationalism in your comment as well. You are looking for an India that doesn't have any minorities, that's a stretch. Commit a mass genocide maybe? Is that what will make it work? That's messed up too. So through secularism, removing religion from government level is a start. Practice the culture and religion at home. There's many examples where religion and politics hasn't worked for many nations. India can't follow that path. \n\n\n\n>For fk's sake, Hindus have are fighting in their own nation in courts for the land that belongs to them and then we have WAQF board claiming entire villages to be theirs.. We have had enough of the europeans, britishers and terrorists (islam)..\n\n>Europeans wiped almost half the population off the planet and now speak of \"human rights\"..I dont even want to talk about the things cult-islam has done..\n\nSeeing some hate here. Hindus are doing just fine. There are some regions in India where they are facing their challenges. So are minorities...I can make the same argument for them too. They are losing housing, can't find work, being beaten up or lynched by mobs. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. \n\nAnd Hindus are doing just fine overseas as well. Including in places like middle East where they are minting dealing with these \"cults\" and sending the rewards of their fruit back to homeland. \n\nYour entire argument so far is, get rid of these cult Muslims/minorities and remove any sort of European influence. That's impossible because rn we speak their language, we dress like them, we act like them, we enjoy their food, we have bunch of Indians willing to give up their nationality and willing to work in these Muslim dominant areas too. \n\nThe woke individuals you are angry at don't want bloodshed because India's history is full of it. It's like repeating history, repeating the same mistakes that were made before. Actually we will be playing by the British game book, divide and conquer. \n\nI understand your frustration towards these groups. But your frustration is leading to hate. And that hate is what some of these Muslims or extremist groups cultivate as well. Driven by national and religious pride leading to violence later. We can't go down their level. I can already see that happening in India  slowly along with justifying abuse/blood towards them. That's a little sick if you ask me. \n\nPeople have been conquered all throughout history. There isn't one place in this world that hasn't gone through abuse of sorts. Abuse by its own people too (which my initial argument was and you agreed). So we can't like say oh...2000 years ago we had peace. Did we really? \n\nI suggest working hard, doing good for your people vs taking arms against another group. You may might as well put on an orange shirt and join Bajrang dal at this point if hate/dislike for others blinds you. Not worth it if you ask me.",

Independence Day will be celebrated from Gilgit to Garo mountain. Our country became independent 76 years ago, but the scars of its partition still haunt every Indian. Now we have to realize the resolution of Akhand Bharat. Come on then.. Let us unite so that we always remember the integrity of Mother India. Bitches be wilding !! LMAO Marathi manus UP walo ko ane nahi dete....ani tyana akhanda Bharat mangta aahe. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Losers. Akhand does not mean united, it means \"undivided,\" which itself is a stupidity because india was never United, to begin with, except of course in the wet dreams of chaddis. Why doesn't he paint the whole earth orange You parents collectively should voice it up. This isn‚Äôt appropriate. India has been culturally united since the Aryan migration. Is Aksai Chin not part of akand bharat anymore? But this isn't cultural unity that they are talking about rather they are talking about political unity. You are right. I apologise for misunderstanding the context. üôè I think your Dean wants a Rajya Sabha Ticket after his retirement. Poetic that even in their wildest masturbatory fantasies Kashmir is still divided Name and shame ofcourse from a nameless account.. twitter pe bhi daaldo Ridiculous...when you see the education system being indoctrinated, then there's a problem. Also this fantasy of akhand Bharat and it's desire is even more concerning. They already have. Why don't they add Australia? Are they stupid? If people are justifying unacademy then this is also justified I really wish to know how come so many languages are spoken in India itself if it was culturally united. Scientifically speaking, it takes quite a long time for a whole language to develop, the population speaking it needs to be isolated and flourishing properly for such a complicated thing as language to fully take form in writing and speaking. Indian languages are not just spoken differently but written differently too. How come such numerous complex languages developed in India if the people were united culturally for a very long time. They must have been living isolated from each other for a long time, like hundreds of years. The different language regions are so close by too. It's not just different dialects, these are completely different languages. We all know major parts of china and parts of southeast asia have been united for long and were culturally similar, so they have various dialects of same language. But not in India. And till few years back most people didn't even understand each other's languages at all, only after communication and traveling has been made easy in recent times that we understand a bit of other state's languages. Till few years back most regions/states even celebrated their own festivals alone, the festivals were celebrated exclusively by the people of that state speaking that language only. It's only now since recent past that most Indian festivals are celebrated across the Country. The only common language which was there between various states was English because English influenced and imposed their culture on everyone, Like all the other colonies of English. When i Look at any other regions of the world, people who had been unified since prehistoric times , they speak same language or similar dialects. ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡§∏‡•á ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§∂‡§ø‡§ü‡§™‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡§∞ ‡§®‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•á! Ask him how to make Afghanistan and Pakistan included in akhand bharat and you'll get some amazing answer This is just sad coming from a Dean of a university. Religion will duck us over big time. How do you think the Dean got the position? Same thing in my college, I know for a fact that the Dean is not qualified - based on requirements, she's never been any HOD, not even a professor, and several more qualified and better faculty members were passed over and she was chosen. She's really into all this BJP and RSS stuff, openly tells that all students must attend these events etc. lol the India in treir \"Akhand Bharat\" doesnt even have POK Division of languages is due a long period of time and does not necessarily indicate isolation. For example, when the Yamanaya tribes in Central Asia existed there was a single language called Indo European. But with enough time this language evolved in different forms and now they are so different that one cannot even understand the other. Likewise, if we study Indian languages from a linguistic standpoint we can easily link languages like Sanskrit to the later developed Prakrit languages. The Dravidian languages also have a common ancestor. This is evident from the fact that even in the times of the Guptas, we could se the study of the Vedas from the valleys of Kashmir to the shores of the South. Yes u r right he is rss member . I am also from ,sy student üòÇ When I was in school, Akhand Bharat was South Asia + Afghanistan and Myanmar. Now I see they're including all of SE Asia too. Soon enough they'll claim all of Asia lol. Walchand college h kya Sangli wala? Yes You really think anybody will revolt against this ? It's a lost cause Wait for them to add China in this and thats when the fun will begin! Jhanda vandan tommorow ü´° It does include POK... Tum students log ne kabhi kuch bola nahi on the group or at least to the teachers? OP act indignant and bring this up on whatsapp That explains a lot! Bole toh bole kya ? Aur mai akela kaise jau , aadhe Stufents support krte bache aadhe neutral hai jinko politics mai kuch interest nai sif cgpa badhane Sai matlab hai inhe Astralaya >then this is also justified Bloody conquest is justified? Hmmm. Lol an sinister idea would to report such msgs. Tere class neutral bacche yeh toh hi sakte hai. Forget about POK it has whole afganistan and tibet Astra-laya? Capturing Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia. Mazaak chal raha hai kya bhai, though we have superior army, these countries are backed by China, USA and Russia, kya sooch kar logo me joomla faila rhe hai. Pehle apne city to fiz karo, then state ko aur fir desh ko... uske baad chale jaana game of thrones khelne... Maybe bcoz its the independence day,stupid?? But they won't include the part that China is taking from us >l Asia existed there was a single language called Indo European. But with enough time this language evolved in different forms and now they are so different that one cannot even understand the other. Likewise, if we study Indian languages from a linguistic standpoint we can easily link languages like Sanskrit to the later developed Prakrit languages. The Dravidian languages also have a common ancestor. This is evident from the fact that even in the times of the Guptas, we could se the study of Religion does not mean culture. Christianity and Islam is almost everywhere in the world. Bible is studied both in Nepal and Chile does not mean Nepalese and Chilean share same culture. Do these people realise that Akhanda Bharat will have 700 million Muslims and an open border with Afghanistan? Yeah you can't handle Muslims here but want to take over Muslim countries lmaooooo. r/2vikramaditya4u But I was not talking about culture I was talking about language. That dude satyapal did talk about something like that in his interview with thapar... **Theocratism Aint Great My Man** Moon ko bhi orange paint karke dikhado BC make akhand solar system Not if they have their way. Isn‚Äôt the imagery of DurgaMa and the color saffron a dog whistle for hindu domination? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Good luck invading Vietnam, lol Which one? Coep, Walchand, Pict? Unemployment leads to people focusing more on things that they can use to show other they are better for example religion, caste, nationalism, language, etc. So that they can benefit from entitlement rather than hard work. Dean is probably not capable of doing anything that's why he is seeking entitlements. Jobs are temporary,The Indian empire is forever Get a better clg üôÑ Bhai ye next update mein japan bhi add krdena, I'll feel desi hentai dekh rha hun Ye saala ladaakh sambhala nahi Jaa Raha.

Irony when did Maharashtra get partitioned ? Ane nahi dete ?aur chahiye tereko local train me teri gand marvane ke liye Ask your Dean China already took some parts in Leh Ladaku but our Pm unable to show them Laal aankh instead we have increased import of chinese goods.ü•≤ü•≤ Is it Walchand? Where is Thanos when we want him? Everyone is patriotic until it‚Äôs free and fun. ask him to donate 20% annual salary to Center or ask him to send his son to army, he will show his true colour. Brother understand that, placement will be on newly added Akhand Bharat area. Let them first protect our official border lands from China. Bhai walchand?? M not at all surprised, when i was there, subtle casteism was prevalent there Bhai kuch mat kr, walchand me badla lete teacher log, i have been victim of that college casteism , mere samay autonomy ka bhot misuse hota tha, i don't know it currently Is this Walchand college of engineering? If it is, it's really shameful to promote a political agenda on college groups.... Kone ahe re dean? That's 'Straya for ya I‚Äôd love to put your dean in a room with a Khalistani supporter and see what happens. ‡§¨‡•á‡§∞‡•ã‡§ú‡§º‡§ó‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ø‡§£‡§™‡§Ç‡§§, name a better duo. What scars of partition some of these ultra nationalist are talking about? Never seen them discussing the Bengal famine and riots, or helping the families who actually suffered the partition or even study the actual history, culture, geography, demography etc of the people who they intend will soon be part of their United India or is it Just colonialism 2.0? honestly why the hell people are focusing on this kind of shit and even if all the countries merge and form akhand bharat it will be too unstable to handle Good luck dominating afghans .The chaddis will have a giant hole in the back of their chaddis Yes. We are ready to shed war. We are ok with people, soldiers getting killed. But no Sir, I won't go to fight, I will also not send my son's to fight and die. No, I will not shed my blood. These people should be forced to see the movie All Quiet on The Western Front. Why you need college placements ?? Are you not skilled enough to get a job on your own ?? 'educated people' It's easy given the population. The major thing is how will they the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. More like Paakhand Bharat Looks like a recipe for disaster and bloodshed. Irresponsible and dangerous to even propose this idea. It‚Äôs mind boggling. Didn‚Äôt they put something like this up in the parliament and got scolded by other countries. They already seem to be claiming the Chinese province Yunnan, apart from Tibet of course. How can one of the most prestigious colleges in Maharashtra not provide any placements? Is that how bad things have gotten now? If it's a prestigious college why can't they provide placements? If akhand bharat is existed today..Muslims will be in majority..ask professor is that ok for him? chup hoja akhand brahmand bhi exist karta hai What clg is this lmao, I'm marathi and I wanna know Interesting that his akhand bharat has separate West Bengal and Bangladesh. Lebensraum 2023 College is supposed to spoon feed you the placements? Don't you need to be employable to be actually employed. Although the Akhand Bharat thing is wrong. He might be urban naxal that‚Äôs how he became sean and sitting in that chair for last 30 years All funds are being eaten by appeasement and reservation where is funds for R&D , science and inventions and then jobs . For last 65 years + all money is going to appear 1 sect and their unparalleled breeding and freebies Even I though so, walchand college of enggüòì Don‚Äôt know where he disappeared and calling him to come back daily isn‚Äôt it imaginary ? Jldi visa lelo mitro. Bro, I studied in WCE ! Kya haal ho gya bhai , ye kya chal rha h ! I wonder what they want to do with akhand bharath It‚Äôs not easy, the soviets, british, Americans all failed to get Afghanistan, so it‚Äôs definitely not easy. I wish they claim they found Shiv Ling on Mars and they can all just fuck off this planet Because in the post apocalyptic world after mutual assured destruction, the cockroaches that inherit the planet shall name it akhand bharat. Apart from all the irrational stuff, Why Don't they place bharat mata in the centre of Akhand Bharat? Said this because I never saw anyone noticing this except me. They want the land not the people. In their world view they should either convert, be subservient to a Hinditvavadi government, voluntarily leave... or worse... Lol The Americans succeeded in their mission which was to wage a non-sense for the profit of elites. And India has many times successfully conquered Afghanistan. I never said conquering Afgajnsitan is easy but it's a child plat compared to controlling Pakistan and Bangladesh given their population. The two are totally seperate things. Thats a lot of muslim majority areas üòä For people who hate muslims , they sure do want more muslims in the country. Maybe they ll send them to Pakistan Including Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh would make the resulting country muslim majority It means hum china pe attack krege or baki sb pe b or Jeet b jaege or innocent people maare jaege.Andhbhakto ka brain wash bot ache se kia gaya h Shut up pumpkin suraj ko Hanuman ji kha gae they wo to already hai Its some propaganda by sone party‚Ä¶. Got posted in my home society group as well. Claim the whole world has bharat Kya hota tha bhai batao hame WCE sangli Walchand College of Engineering? If only Indians would spend less time fantasizing about imaginary borders and more time cleaning the poop off their streets. an easy excuse when you couldn't do your job. I just wonder what the map would look like if the UK started an akhand Britain campaign. Akhand bharat - Deluison of the highest order. People who want it don't even realise that they won't remain a majority if it actually comes into existence. And the UK at this rate since Sunak is PM. In fact some have done already They should try adding some parts of China as well lol It's was not easy because it was difficult to distinguish b/w civilians and gurrila groups, it's a different case if the goal is total annihilation of all civilian lives. Har saal placements Kam horhe aur RW propoganda badh rha The way things are going, we will soon become part of Akhand China. Where's awrd Want still more people to wallow in poverty. Don‚Äôt you think actual duty of education institutes is to inculcate thoughts into its students and nothing to do with directly providing job. There are couple of institutes like JNU etc which inculcate thoughts and also provide job opportunities take admission there ‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§°‡•Ä‡§®‡§≤‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó, \"‡§Ø‡•á‡§°‡§ù‡§µ‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á ‡§§‡•ã, ‡§Ö‡§∏‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ö‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§®‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§§ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡§æ‡§π‡•Ä.\" We do not want or need an imperialist India.

But still there will be hindu majority 50-50 will be there..consider pakistan + bangladesh Is it Walchand college ? Expecting to streach to Australia and Canada soon due to number of Indian students. No brother. Hindus alone in India are 112 crore. Pakistan muslim 23cr, Bangladesh muslims 16cr, Indonesia muslims 27cr. Even if you consider whole population of these countries they don't match alone hindu population of India. Initially, it used to Mauryan empire + present day India, then it became Mauryan Empire + British India, then Mauryan Empire + British India + Chola Empire. Now it looks like they added Tibet into it as well. Akhand Bharat keeps getting more akhand every year. Bhau, mera ek internal + external milake 3.5 ghante hua tha with a group of 3 students only. What we all did was protest against a teacher of applied thermo who purposefully failed 3 good students in the last attempt by setting the paper way too hard for graduation students to pass . Mechanical dept ke protest ke bare me puch liyo kisi se, suicide attempt case tha ek bande ka in 2017, bach gya fortunately woh mera classmate tha Akhand Chu* Its the geography of Afghanistan that makes it so difficult to conquer and the Soviets did try to wipe out the population which just made the resistance more fierce Even Shah jahan and arungzeb failed despite trying and preparing for a whole decade and having the support of locals Your dean is a fruitcake. Ja re photographer Thailand bhi? kya baat hai sir kya baat waah Can you share your experiences While geography does play a huge role that's still not the entire picture, also we shouldn't compare old empires to the nations modern day's military might, soviets while killed more than 2m people there they still were mostly targetting areas where terrors groups were receiving support and civilian casualties by the US which had much stronger military are 10times as less than soviets, US lost because of guerrilla warfare, if we only count capturing capital state as victory than any top 10 military powers will be able to achieve that and hold ground for decades. And with robotic warfare defeating primitive militaries only becomes easier. Some even include Afghanistan as part of Akhand Bharat Now they have added Phillipines and Indonesia too. Could you please point to the timestamps of the referred video? How is a Dean of a College unemployed? Walchand? Its his son's choice if he wants to go in army or not. /s lagaya kar comment me So as per these morons, people living east of the Garo Hills (Meghalaya) are not part of Akhand Bharat, contradicting their own stupid kindergarten map. But by that logic, India shouldn't even be a thing now? Each state should be its own sovereign state (country). India (the subcontinent) was always a united/related entity, whether it be culturally, linguistically, etc. Of course, we can't go into alternative histories and be fantasizing about invading other countries just to reinstate a glorious past, but there's nothing wrong with per se wanting a united India. you just arent capable of having a placement, if you could ,you wouldn't be in such clg \\*Thora aur Chad dean üóø Are you aware that Afghanistan is called the graveyard of empires? Wow, delusional. Its fascism Nazi also fantasized like this Their was not such thing akhand bharat.. Indian subcontinent was ruled by kings and Britishers before independence... Akhand bharat was theory and imagination of savarkar before independence. What do they think? what year is this?? 1923?? Your dean has acute symptoms of BJP fobia. Keep yourself away from him. üòÅüòÅ Kaunse college ka dean WhatsApp group pe hai bhai. It‚Äôs actually my first time seeing this Or you can get placement in Bajrang Dal/Gaurakshaks Group nahi , college ka official announcement channel hai Going the US way, but reverse, there Indians were killed for land here opposite Australia as well üòÇüòÇ You forgot 20cr in India, that will make it 86cr, then it will be 112cr H-86cr M. Which batch you were in? Which college? You wouldn't be crying for placements if you deserved them..There's a reason why you are on reddit whining, Always babbling whenever a attempt is made for our cultural heritage.. /s ki kya jarurat hai... Placement is just about gaming the system and giving excuses... You have to become skilled enough so that you can join whichever company you want, irrrespective of it comes to your college placement or not. Imposition huh? Bhagwa dekhte se aag lagjati h...Good enoughüíÄ Just like it was in the earlier times?.. I want what you smoke... Akhand Bharat was indeed a reality but not so as shown in the post..Maybe try reading actual history instead of the colonial fuckery u so love Nah, Pakistan aint theirs either \"imaginary\" just the word everyone would pick for you That's a great point in support, studying of same scriptures and following same religion, i agree. But i feel this cant be a sure evidence, because a lot of different cultures around the world have followed same religion and studied same scriptures, even though they are culturally different. Religion spreads like wildfire across the regions and cultures, take for example any part of the world and any religion. And when it comes to origin of languages then all the semitic languages have a common ancestor, yet people speaking them have been culturally different. Same goes with Indo-aryan languages like sanskrit, they are spoken by completely different cultural groups of asia and Europe. I am not a linguistic, haven't studied comparative language sciences, but i have studied Sanskrit and Arabic and i would like to say that they have such similar grammar! Like very very similar grammar rules and word forms, like none other languages i know. Yet the 2 regions haven't been culturally similar. This also begs the question what do you mean by \"culture\", if by culture you mean it's just the Gods they worship then quite possibly most of the world has been culturally same at some point of time, even arabs were polytheistic and had idols, most world worshipped multiple gods and had idols before christianity. But if by \"culture\" we mean the way people lived day to day, clothes they wore, food they ate, festivals they celebrated, marriage and kinship rules, languages they spoke, their architecture, their likes and dislikes, then it's not hard to say who have been culturally United and who have been culturally dissimilar for long. Also, dont you feel isolation is important for a language to develop because if there is no isolation and population has access to an already spoken language which people understand easily then which person would spend unnecessary time learning something such complex thing as a new language? . And we are speaking about old times when people lived day to day, each daylight hour was important and nightly productive activities were minimal because of lack of facilities. Even today people from developed countries dont care to learn a new language because the alternative mother tongue is available to them and they don't care about other languages, eg in Japan, US, UK, Europe. The various different languages from indo-european languages developed as you said exactly because different population groups got isolated from each other. Of course it's natural given how inter-tribe and inter-population wars were so common. Resources were limited, wars were the go-to means for acquiring more land and resources. Sorry if it's all jumbled up, i wrote hastily but i hope you get what am trying to say. Let me know what do you think about my train of thought.... CHAD CLG! TRYING TO BRING PLACEMENTS BY EXPANDING AREA! Dude that's not a prestigious college. Chapri OP enginner thinks he's studying at a world class institution lol. Maybe after a while it would be akhand duniya lol Cholas influenced the Malays and Indonesia is influenced a lot by the Malays... Duh. The modern Indonesia and its independence was in many ways influenced by Nippon (Japan) and since Japan tried to free Indonesia it means they are nationalists just like us. Japan belongs to Akhand Bharat too. lol I want what u smoke. And i not readed any fucking colonial history... Before Britishers Indian subcontinent and whole of the world was ruled by kings as kingdom.. Infact Kingdom was just like countries Country means sovereign state... So They were also like sovereign state bcz they were independent in everything and in all affairs... But when Britishers came they United kingdoms and removed kings form most of the kings and administered whole of subcontinent as a single country But later broken in many pieces like burma etc. So even if u consider india was a single country... India cannot become akhand bharat just by your wish... No neighbour country wants to join india.. And india has no right over them.. And also india will never force them Its not gone happen even in 100 years .. so keep dreaming fantasizing and fapping to akhand bharat map.. Dean is unable to provide employment thus he is using this strategy to satiate the unemployed students with false pride. Choti bachhi ho kya? \"One of the most prestigious colleges of Maharashtra\" - IIT Bombay ? \"One of the most prestigious colleges of Maharashtra\" - IIT Bombay ? Khud bhale hi placement ke liye eligible na ho thikra college walo pe hi fodna hai, nalayak Tere sath kar diya kya pakhand Bharat ne? Walchand College of Engineering? Yes In the earliest times, all human life originated from Africa. So paint everything in African colors? 1400years before, There was no existence of the cult Islam...Yet they claim to have ownership of lands and temples much ancient and make divisions among poeple believers and non-believers..Make sense? How about we accept the fact that hindus have been the most persecuted community and yet are labelled as intolerant if they speak for their own rights... Also, South Africa has a major tribe named khusites..They consider themselves to be descendants of Kush (Son of Ram bhagwan) I can already see the sense of respect you have towards the nation with what u said abt akhand bharat.. Anyways, You still are gloryfing the fact that Britishers were the one to unite india..Bharat didn't need anyone to unite it..It was already culturally and ethically united.. You think as if Akhand Bharat was a moment started by savarkar? wtf.. You talk about kings, yet wont be able to name 5 prominent names..Kings did rule and they ruled with harmony.. Chattarapati Shivaji Maharaj went down south when they needed help..Maharana Pratap sent forces in different \"kingdoms\" for aid..Raja Raja Chola, Rajendra Chola, Bappa Rawal, Prithiviraj Singh Chouhan.. GoodLuck with the \"United Kingdoms\" theory, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, belonged to bharat and still do... Bharat has seen mass invasions and suffered for more than 2000 years, Yet we have our cultural heritage and if my scriptures and history straightly indicate the land from Himlaya to Hindu Mahasagar is rightly bharat...Then It is.. Phillipines!! Wow! Jitna hai utna to sambhalta nahi aur chahiye lakhand bharat ‡§Ö‡§ñ‡§Ç‡§° ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§ is the sum of all 7 continents. What about Madagascar Can we imagine the outrage if the British wanted all their East India Co. territory back? People who spread messages like this one need to rot in dark cells It is only called graveyard in modern times I bet lot of kingdoms ruled Afghanistan before modern times. Din is a real future makerüòä Depending upon the skill level, Even that wouldn't be suitable for y'all.. Protecting aint something you can do What majority of students think about this msg? Just what muslims did in kashmir, what they have been doing in muslim majority areas? Right? I don't understand. Does any of the public want Akhand Bharat? If any political power is advertising it for votes, then, they're banking on a lot of people wanting it. But why do so many people want Akhand Bharat? Ironic as it is, that's what Mughal invaders did. Though they didn't kill everyone. My Dream at 3AM ü§£ü§£ 14-15 country aur jod dete, waise bhi imagination hai, apni fantasy ko restrict kyun kar rahe hain? if I was invited, I will attend it and laugh out loud non-stop at whoever is organising this > Change is the law of life.

Maybe he is focusing on Akhand bharat to distract you from his failure to provide jobs. At least that‚Äôs the case for his overlords. I haven't advocated for a lynch, my statement was to refute the M majority even if Akhand Bharat happens. Let me check which times we're in. Yup, we're in modern times. At least I am. couldn't even enter into south and northeast India and dreaming of conquering SEA and Aussie üíÄ. USA will invade and kill Modi for his dictatorship.

This is why this theory of akhand Bharat sounds out of ordinary. You said they were culturally (not politically ) similar 2000 years ago (lol...might as well return current European nations back to Rome). Individuals believing in this theory want Afghanistan, Bangladesh and other nations \"back\" because they were culturally similar 2000 years ago. That means if they they got the chance, they will want it back politically by actually invading and \"reclaiming\" lost land. The kings you have selected have all fought against each to spread their influence. Sure they had their harmonic days, but they surely had their war days too. Raja Raja chola: fought against Chalukya dynasty (another empire within present day India) to implement his empire. Rajendra chola: fought against Western Chalukya Empire and helped reached his father's (above) ambitions to it's Zenith. Bappa Rawal: a vassal of the Mori ruler Manuraja decided to set his differences aside and joined the anti Arab confederacy to fend of Arabs invasion from north. Prithviraj Singh Chouhan: Noted for defeating Chandelas (small kingdom of its own). Also set apart his differences and joined the rajput princes to take on the Ghurid army. And finally, Sivaji: he was one king you can credit by spending most of his time fending off \"foreign\" invaders despite having conflicts and later defeating his half brother (and his army). So yes...all these kings you listed had their empires/kingdoms which did get into conflicts with other smaller regional empires/kingdoms within the akhand Bharat borders who shared common cultural values. They became \"united\" time to time when it came to foreign invaders. Some of them even sided with foreign invaders as well to have an upper hand over their regional rivals (who btw shared those common cultural/religious values). Conflicts between those kings/rulers/princes remained. Bharat was in conflict despite having its moments of harmony too. Empires came, and vanished and then came again and vanished...until the foreign forces showed up. And when they showed up, Bharat (the landscape) still fought among itself, sometimes even partnering with foreign forces. It was all about power no matter where these kings came from (Afghanistan or core India). The only thing that you can stand on about akhand Bharat map is the fact that Hinduism (that too forms of it) spread throughout that region. And the other thing I can agree on is that British weren't here to unite India, but rather seek division (divide and conquer). I think everyone has their own priorities Like you need job and your dean Aakhand Bharat Nothing wrong in that just make efforts to reach close to your goals Bhosdika Can I ask a question? Agar india jaisa koi desh tha hi nahi toh Nehru and gandhi ji ne kisko Britishers se ajaad karaya? We called most of north eastern Chinese . I agree with most of what you said.. But if we look poltically, Even today india is not politically united. Look whats happening in bengal, karnataka and tamil nadu..A nation can never be politically united when there's a element in society which still wants further division or partition..The situation in bengal is so bad that presidential rule must be implemented.. India has already done away with 1/3rd of its land through partition, All of them which are now currently islamic. And yet, In the name of secularism we still are repeating the same mistakes... With the idea of akhand bharat, which seems impossible to many.. Atleast the woke shitheads will realise their true history and heritage and potentially change their mindsets about single sided \"brotherhood\" which they call secularism.. For fk's sake, Hindus have are fighting in their own nation in courts for the land that belongs to them and then we have WAQF board claiming entire villages to be theirs.. We have had enough of the europeans, britishers and terrorists (islam).. Europeans wiped almost half the population off the planet and now speak of \"human rights\"..I dont even want to talk about the things cult-islam has done.. It's about time people know whay \"actually\" happened and is happening..The notion of akhand bharat was true, and still stands today if it encourages the upcoming generation to stand their ground without giving upto anyone's demands any longer and rightfully claim whats ours... Countless lives have been sacrificed (currently, too) for protecting our motherland and it surely wasnt for us to preach love about the same people who perpetrated the entire scheme and still wish to do the same given the chance...Just look at muslim majority areas Is it Walchand college? I have seen some photos extending it up to even west Europe lol >which still wants further division or partition.. Well currently people are too focused on religious divide, rather than talking about unity over INDIA. >India has already done away with 1/3rd of its land through partition, All of them which are now currently islamic. And yet, In the name of secularism we still are repeating the same mistakes... Pakistan and Bangladesh if that is what you mean. Afghanistan does not see Indians eye to eye. They consider themselves a Steppe people. Matter of fact, Turks occasionally try to claim Afghanistan...turks also have a andh Baharat concept of their own. So do Persians. So do Russians, Israelis, so did Nazi Germany..now it's India. And yes secularism is crucial for India's success. India is made up of various large tribes of people (like always). People argue what about the Hindus of Pakistan? That doesn't mean we start treating minorities like shit too. That's an illogical argument. It will take India back to terrible turmoil actually. So we have to follow through with this. My problem is with the nationalist religiously driven individuals of India. If they get the opportunity, they will rip the constitution apart. >With the idea of akhand bharat, which seems impossible to many.. Atleast the woke shitheads will realise their true history and heritage and potentially change their mindsets about single sided \"brotherhood\" which they call secularism.. It will remain impossible if followers of akhand Bharat start discriminating towards people who don't agree with them. Sorry man, I see a stroke of Nationalism in your comment as well. You are looking for an India that doesn't have any minorities, that's a stretch. Commit a mass genocide maybe? Is that what will make it work? That's messed up too. So through secularism, removing religion from government level is a start. Practice the culture and religion at home. There's many examples where religion and politics hasn't worked for many nations. India can't follow that path. >For fk's sake, Hindus have are fighting in their own nation in courts for the land that belongs to them and then we have WAQF board claiming entire villages to be theirs.. We have had enough of the europeans, britishers and terrorists (islam).. >Europeans wiped almost half the population off the planet and now speak of \"human rights\"..I dont even want to talk about the things cult-islam has done.. Seeing some hate here. Hindus are doing just fine. There are some regions in India where they are facing their challenges. So are minorities...I can make the same argument for them too. They are losing housing, can't find work, being beaten up or lynched by mobs. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. And Hindus are doing just fine overseas as well. Including in places like middle East where they are minting dealing with these \"cults\" and sending the rewards of their fruit back to homeland. Your entire argument so far is, get rid of these cult Muslims/minorities and remove any sort of European influence. That's impossible because rn we speak their language, we dress like them, we act like them, we enjoy their food, we have bunch of Indians willing to give up their nationality and willing to work in these Muslim dominant areas too. The woke individuals you are angry at don't want bloodshed because India's history is full of it. It's like repeating history, repeating the same mistakes that were made before. Actually we will be playing by the British game book, divide and conquer. I understand your frustration towards these groups. But your frustration is leading to hate. And that hate is what some of these Muslims or extremist groups cultivate as well. Driven by national and religious pride leading to violence later. We can't go down their level. I can already see that happening in India slowly along with justifying abuse/blood towards them. That's a little sick if you ask me. People have been conquered all throughout history. There isn't one place in this world that hasn't gone through abuse of sorts. Abuse by its own people too (which my initial argument was and you agreed). So we can't like say oh...2000 years ago we had peace. Did we really? I suggest working hard, doing good for your people vs taking arms against another group. You may might as well put on an orange shirt and join Bajrang dal at this point if hate/dislike for others blinds you. Not worth it if you ask me. wtf So they want approximate 80 corores of Muslims too ! Is it practical? If you really think india is more capable of power projection in Afghanistan then the soviet Union who was neighbouring Afghanistan at that time then i am sorry but you are stupid,indian forces are defensive and its extremely expensive to supply an army in foreign lands something india can't afford Kay? Walchand cha kissa aahe ha? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ya bhai mere college ke group mein bhi placements nahi ati but aise chutiyappe nahi karte college wale We want such dean in every college in India! desh badal raha hai has a new meaning! Blud I also go the same clg.....üòÇüòÇüòÇ Dean ko bolo: Bharat bnega akhand, Aap lelo mere L**d Who asked you to go to such a college in the first place? I really don't understand this RW fantasy wet dream of \"Akhand Bhaarat\". I mean, you already hate the Muslims of India, not to mention all the others who dare disagree with you, what do you think would happen exactly when you combine add Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan into mix. I mean, why on earth would you want the Taliban or the barren Afghanistan be a part of your country. Dean Missed Japan Yeah modi ki Tarah pehle me bharat ke liye ye kar dunga woh kar dunga phir election ke baad Bharat walo ko kuch aata hi nahi kuch nahi ho sakta unka Bcz Britishers were ruling here and running their govt by force... Also people kingdoms (princely states) were also hating thier kings bcz they used to take heavy taxes and exploit people... When Britishers came here due to nationalism we become United ... They already did. There's video on YouTube in which an idiot says Russia and China bhi hai akhand Bharat me. Without the necessary change and development in the country all this patriotism is just waste piece of shit! US spent about 67% of Indias entire GDP on afghanistan and still got dog piled by them, what makes you think we'll be able to take them out? Afghanistan is an empirical grave, no one can take them. He's right. Job milegi to tum apni life me aage badhoge.. fir Akhand Bharat ke lie kaam ni kr paaoge. Ye KARTAVYAKAAL hai bandhu, tumhe apne Hindu hone ka praman dena hoga ek kar sevak, gobar rakshak bnkeüî• seems inappropriate for a nonpolitical position person to preach on political issues. Akhand Bharat is an eventuality even tough people may think its an election gimmick. Akhand Bharat might not be visible for a considerable amount of time but we'll reach that milestone down the line. Have faith. Lol college will surely provide placement to Bjp IT cell. And all students will becomeb their bots abusing and harassing anyone who tries to give them some logic. If your dean's Akhand Bharat Dream is true, please let me know as well. Will try international placements Do they know that there are more small islands in Polynesia? You can't even say anything to these people, maybe even as management because it's clear the dean got into the position through outside power Even if they want to do it, why do they want so many muslims in their Akhan or maybe they have a way to not include them xD Deeply traumatized xD. They can't handle ladakh, they want the whole subcontinent. Hopefully but these people get an erection by showing off their fanatasies He believes in akhand Bharat during Ram times where there were supposedly monsters too. No point arguing with these people. Won't do anything. They do this publicly cause no one dares to say anything. I'm from this college and one day the Dean of our college in his was flexing on the amount of work he did for RSS and also taunted people who were anti rss WHEN and who Last time Germany and Japan tried that and well.... The map shows captured j and k with Pakistan/Afghanistan and china.. kudos to akhand bharat Why does it look like \"Akhand Bharat\" is growing in size? I remember when it would include Burma but nothing East of it DHARAVI MAANUSH Yaa college groups ko only assignment & imp notices ke liye hota hai yeh kab se shuru hua hai ..vro.... Itna sach mat bol Bhai What a TPO?? Hello fellow walchandite..feels bad to see such downfall of prestigious institution... once upon a time we were pride of pachim maharashtra Do people still study under trees surrounding football pitch ??"
