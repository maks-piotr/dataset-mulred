        "Is Manipur not a foreign conspiracy yet?\n\n/s",
        "This is the direct result of a PM who doesn’t answer to anyone, a CM who will not be replaced because that will be considered a weakness, a home minister who did absolutely nothing to bring peace even with a double engine sarkar.\n\nAll the PM did was exactly what Trump did after tha race based riots - that there are bad people on BOTH sides - by mentioning Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Shame on Modi\n\nShame on Biren when he questioned nationality of Kukis.\n\nIt is these acts of PM and CM that encourage the mob that they have the double engine sarkar behind them and they can do anything, including rape women while the mob watches.\n\nThis is what we Indians are now known for. Raping minority women after stripping them and then making videos of these heinous acts as trophies.\n\nThis is on Modi and he has to go in 2024",
        "Is it not a foreign country?",
        "🙃😮 my bad. \n\nHow is it not a foreign conspiracy yet in a ‘foreign country’ that just so happens to have a bjp government?\n\nForeignception Conspireption /s",
        "Biren knows everything yet he remains silent. I was recalling the '01 riots where the CM remained silent and majority attacked the minority.\nState Police remained silent in both cases.\n\nSoon this will spread to all states. Sad times ahead.",
        "Is it possible for r/India to organize a common people protest in Delhi and other cities against Manipur incident?",
        "To become a PM nowadays, you need an impressive  resume. One rivaling  that of 2002. So CM is eyeing that!",
        "Nah bro everything is a foreign conspiracy specially the west, west people bad bro, they don't read bhagvat gita, all the aeroplane and nasa rockets ancient indian technology bro, anyone making any discovery or groundbreaking research is just copying aNcIeNt EeDaAn text bro",
        "But the dynamics are extremely different here. It could be a lot worse than Gujarat.\n\nRight across the international border, the Kuki-Chin-Mizos are already a major part in the armed resistance agaisnt the Myanmar Military Junta. Battle hardened veterans of the Myanmar Civil War can easily make their way into Manipur.\n\nAcross in Mizoram, people are also willing to get involved. Reports of arms being shipped to the Kukis has been made numerous times already.\n\nIf this doesn't stop now, Gujarat will pale in comparison to the bloodshed.",
        "Yeah right. Another example, the certified Chu who supported removal of Periodic Table from NCERT books, just check where his children are and what positions they hold professionally. They had the periodic table in their syllabus.",
        "A wild George soros appeared",
        "Chaddiwalo ko bhagao",
        "The new CM of karanataka said it very well, these safron goons kids study in countries like the US, UK, Canada etc but they will tell indian youngsters about hindutva, cow urine and all bullshit. Why are their kids living a modern lifestyle in the west if they hate the western culture so much?",
        "Exactly. Throw them out now. Do not wait till the elections.",
        "Please make a post. There are already ongoing protests.",
        "It is depending on who you ask. Some ex army has already claimed it to be Chinese influence 🤦‍♂️",
        "Keep blaming Kukis for everything and playing bohsideism, that'll surely make Gujarat pale in comparison as more Kukis are killed with this as a \"jusification\".",
        "I am literally a Mizo. I just want the violence to stop.\n\nIf it doesn't stop now, it will cause more harm. Can't you aww that?",
        "Can you please link the source",
        "Don't pay heed to this guy man. Its difficult for him to differentiate between opinion and facts.",
        "Dude, he was not blaming anyone or giving justifications, just spitting facts. The only people to blame are the authorities and social media to and extent. No one is blaming either of the communities.\n\nHe was just pointing out that the ethnic mix in that area is more complicate than the binary of Kukis and Maiteis and quick action is required or the damages will be irreparable.",
