    "selftext": "I was looking for a life insurance and was checking out Tata AIA, HDFC Life and Canara HSBC. to checkout the price, you have to authorize them to override the DND. And this is where problem starts. They keep calling you non-stop. Canara and Tata contacted less frequently, but HDFC wa sthe worst. Was in a meeting with phone in silent and HDFC kept calling again and again. Blocked several numbers and still no respite.\n\nThe funniest part is the companies say that DND registration will take 30 days to take effect, while DND override happens within seconds.\n\nAnyone has a solution for this? I am unable to even out my toddler to sleep because of this nuisance.",
