        ">What catastrophe?\n\nWhen awareness is lost, how do you question?",
        "Exactly. \n\nAnyone else coming here. I meant in the sense that you think people in the country get to know the problems there? \n\nThey Are at an advanced stage than at what we are. They don't know about the problems. Just brainwashed.",

        "How else are they going to fight the religious war with the enemies of Hinduism if there aren't unemployed misguided youths, the very youths who are now being made to believe that the so called \"Hinduism\" is in danger ?? Agniveers fighting alongside will be the icing on the cake !",

        "Instead of screaming for 70 hour working weeks, would it not be more productive to provide gainful employment to more people with more reasonable working hours? We have thousands of students graduating every yearâ€¦or am I being too simplistic?",
        "Not very sure, that comment by N Murthy was probably for the top leaderships because it is difficult to find such top talent in India as most of them are settled abroad already. In case he meant it for juniors then (I might be wrong but) I kind of think the same way that companies like Infosys(his company) can start hiring more junior engineers and it will solve the problem of total amount of work being done by India in a year as well as employment issues. They say they have world class training and research centers, then why is it so difficult to pick up people and train them to get their work done why do they need more work hours? Do they lack cash in bank or any other resource?",
        "But then the Q is how can we prod the media to do its job better or what is its replacement? What can be done to bring such discussions to the forefront?",
        "I understand but we don't need a majority to Q. We just need a few people to do that just so that we cross the critical mass and then even others will join.  \n\n\nWhen Modi govt repealed the farm laws was it the majority of farmers that were protesting?",
        "All aren't brainwashed. There were protests but then the Govt is too powerful with their actions.  \n\n\nBut media not being able to question the govt and opposition not being able to play the devil's advocate well are big failures of electoral govt systems",
        ">We just need a few people to do that\n\nThose few people (activists) are in prison now, and they could by no way influence the mass. \n\nThe country has proved again and again, election after election, that it has no values or ethics in elections after elections. They also dont have an alternative to BJP.\n\n> When Modi govt repealed the farm laws was it the majority of farmers that were protesting?\n\nYes, it was farmers, mostly from Punjab/ Haryana. The protesters came to Delhi in mass and choked the city.  The protesters dont represent 50% of Indian farmers in numbers, but they had a lot of support from farmers  from almost all the states in India, verbal and nonverbal.",
        ">had a lot of support from farmers  from almost all the states in India, verbal and nonverbal\n\nDoesn't seem so from the lot I have spoken to.  \n\n\nI come from a family whose roots are in the village still and when I talked to the elders they were totally unaware as to what are the laws that will be passed and why such ruckus. When I prodded more they said they would like to have companies buy from them but not if it opens doors for being exploited. I think unless you place safeguards difficult enough for the companies to exploit the farmers who are at the bottom of the food chain and easiest to exploit due to owning/trying to sell perishable goods, they will be exploited. That's where I'm mad at the media and opposition that they did not being out these points.  \n\n\nI would even argue that if the laws were as fair as ruling party claimed then they have the support of the news media, they could have broken the law bit by bit and answered all opposition calling them into debates with Navika, etc in an attempt to educate the public, bring IAS officers and let them break it to the public with proper justification and even ask critics (like Raghuram Rajan, Abhijeet B) to chime in with Q.",

And they know this country has fallen to the hounds in the hands of Criminals Elites a.k.a Bra-man Hindu supremacists ! There are examples everywhere as democracies gets hijacked and when elites lose control they just fkin escape... what happened in Lanka and remember who came to the rescue of that corrupt President, it was India.
