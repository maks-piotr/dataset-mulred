        "Hey you guys.. so recently I finished a French show called \"Dix pour cent\" or \"Call My Agent\". It's on Netflix and it's pretty cool. The characters have a good development and it's not just focussed on one person, and I like that. So it's a show about a Talent Firm and it's agents, their relationship with actors, writers, producers and how they're trying to keep the firm afloat, while their work lives get mixed with their personal (of course). Camille Cottin acted brilliantly and is being recognised internationally!! She totally deserves it!\n\nThey will prolly come up with another season soon, but this was a good ending, they sort of tied up the loose ends, but I can't wait to watch when the new season drops of course.",
