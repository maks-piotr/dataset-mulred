        "Oh man. Just saw a few minutes of its gameplay. It looks amazingly realistic and that sucks because it won't run on my potato. Will have to add it to my play list as I love these types of games. Dead Space and it's action-atmospheric horror is in my top 5 of all time",

        "Yeah, that's bad. But when starting out, you don't really need to have all the dlcs. Plus, atleast for me, with the amount hours I have put, it is definitely worth it for me.",
        "Totally. Hell, I had no knowledge about Warhammer as well. To add to that, I started with Total War from Three Kingdoms, so you can say I am pretty new to all this. The learning curve will be a bit steep earlier because of no knowledge of game mechanics, but eventually, you will know a lot of things and totally worth it.",

        "Totally agree with you here! They shouldn't have done this. Maybe you can buy it on sale like I usually do with all the dlcs for this game (They are usually around 50%, and tend to be on sale frequently). Anyhow, there is no incentive to pre-order it now, just wait for more news regarding WH3, but with the Total War posts about WH3, it certainly seems like this one will be a huge improvement over WH2.",
