I got a call from someone claiming to be from FedEx. \n\nThey said a package with my name on it was caught with drugs and linked to my Aadhaar. They transferred the call to someone claiming to be from the \"Cyber Police\" to file a complaint. \n\nThese so-called \"cyber police\" asked me to join a Skype call to give a video statement. During the call, they threatened me, saying I could face 3-6 years in jail if found guilty. They told me to transfer money to their account for verification. The even sent few pdfs with govt stamps on it.\n\nLuckily, I became suspicious and ended the call without sending any money.",
