        "Its UAE not Saudi. UAE accepts Indian Rupee because it is a big trading partner of India. \n\nThey have mainly two uses for Indian Rupee. \n\n1) Agricultural goods \n\n2) Indian refinery",
        "It won't have much affect, INR is very tightly controlled and UAE(and other oil producing nations) will mostly take INR for amounts equal to what they can spend on buying Indian goods.\n\nIt saves both countries some foreign exchange fee(which can be significant when dealing with Billions) but with the way India has handled INR in the past no country is keeping significant reserves of same.",
        "Just wait and watch bitvh",
        "Demo has made nations like Bhutan and Nepal also dump rupees",
        "As far as I know the oil is priced in USD and payment is made in INR.",
        "Yeah, I mean why would anyone want to hold a currency that can be made useless on wishes of a single person.\n\nIt might have been fine if they actually helped the countries holding INR but instead they fucked up that also.\n\nAnd still haven't learnt the lesson, the 2K note recall is similarly stupid. Plenty of foreign exchanges are facing issues changing those notes.\n\nNo wonder INR is treated like shit even in countries with significant Indian tourists.",
        "Relax champ. No need for this abusive language.\n\nI work in oil trading business here in the UAE. Very recently ADNOC and other oil companies in UAE approached us saying they are ready to sell in Rupee because of government focus on importing food from India as well as sending Emirati crude to India to be refined. \n\nSince our trade with them is very deep, they have use for Indian rupee. Thats why they accept it. Its not replacing the dollar, nor is it a scam.",
        "I am not saying that it doesn't make sense. I am just saying that knowing how BJP operates, they will find out a way to make extra money out of this.",
        "Doesnâ€™t mean anything. To be a reserve currency, you must completely open up your economy. India will never do that. USD is and will remain the reserve currency for the foreseeable future. This purchase is nothing on a global scale.",
        "If BJP wanted to siphon funds from IndianOil Corp. There are much easier way to do it rather than doing it from the spot trade books. \n\nI dont like BJP either but not everything is about them.",
        "People said same about Rafael",
        "Rafael is not the same buddy. \n\nDo I really have to explain the difference between a multi-national oil company that completes million dollar transactions on the daily vs.. \n\nBuying a one-time purchase of fighter jets + SLA agreements.",
        "Indian rupees are like hot potatoes, no one holds on to them. Fickle and temperamental policy making, volatility, etc mean that  UAE will use this to offset some immediate payments. They aren't going to store it.",

        "Unlike Russia Dubai has some use for the rupee.\n\nAlot of our trade with one of our bigger trading partner , Pakistan is routed via Dubai so the importers in Dubai exporting to Pakistan can settle trade in rupee.\n\nDubai also needs the rupee as it's an important hub both for Indian trade and labour.\n\nBut based on my limited reading and trends they will probably use the rupee after putting what they can put to use will probably use it to purchase either USD or US treasury bills which will make the dollar stronger .\n\nSo all in all its a big nothing burger.",
        "US: looks like Saudi needs some democracy.",
        "it won't matter how India handles INR cause the money is in the banks you don't get hard money in such transactions   \nOnly thing that will impact it will exchange rate of inr",
        "for people saying it does not mean anything ?   \nget some idea of how it works and what problem it is solving \n\nIndia has no aim as of now to fight with the dollar directly and it can not even sustain such a fight. India is simply trying to save its foreign reserve and gather more investments from other nations by trading in rupees and not dollar. Most of the nation we are trading with we have a trade deficit which helps in bring more investment rather than investment going in other countries."
