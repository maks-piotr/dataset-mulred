But laws to prevent wrong stuff already do exist by this i mean she can say no, she can breakup, if he harasses she can complain. It's the bitter truth that once u become adult u get perks but u also get responsibilities and here her responsibility is to only engage in sex after marriage if she think that marriage is so much important when it comes to sex.\n\n\n\n\nQuashing male rights while wavering away your own responsibility is not ok at all.\n\n\n\n\nThis law also completely voids any meaning that is to consent.\n\n>If I were you, I wouldn’t bother getting jailed under false accusations.\n\nHonestly what are u even trying to say here?

        "It’s funny how men whine about men’s rights whenever a man is falsely accused in a sexual harassment lawsuit but forget people, regardless of gender, get falsely accused and jailed in almost every other crimes too.

        ">It’s funny how men whine about men’s rights whenever a man is falsely accused\n\nPlease tell me u see how u are breeding hate over here but i am not u i will not do the same.\n\n\n\nAnd to answer your question. Sure people get falsely accused and they go to jail even but is the damage or the percentage of fake cases in total number of cases really equal to damage caused by fake rape case and the number of fake cases in total rape cases, respectively?\n\n\n\n\nAlso u can fight other cases how can a person fight this case, what would he prove? How can he prove he never promised marriage? While a girl can just do this case on the guy by saying he said it verbally.\nPut yourself in the guy's shoes in this situation would u be able to survive?\n\n\n\n\nJudging people on the basis of gender, caste, race or religion is immoral whatever kind of judgement it may be. Someone rightly said a guy should not do what they don't want to be done to their daughter and a girl should not do what they don't want to be done to their son. As it's only a matter of time after which the guy would have a daughter and the girl would have a son.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, if u are so engrossed in being a girl that u can't see guy's problems then i don't need to talk to u coz it's pointless to talk to a human that lacks basic empathy.",

        "Both can be serious issues. Men can't even get raped in India legally. So much for equality.\n\nIndian justice is slow and stupid, rapists don't get punished as much as they should. Very low conviction rate.\n\nBut, gender biased laws are terrible and aren't doing any good, just creating more social problems than solving anything.\n\nAn innocent man doesn't deserve to be punished because he belongs to a gender which does more crimes.",
        "Why even get into situations like this? Understand the person and then get into relations...",

        "That should honestly be more important, fixing our mentality in general. Yes, there should be laws for male abuse idk why it's not the case. And yes it's biased towards women. Question is, what if an actual victim doesn't get justice if laws like this are repealed?",
        "I see your point but doesn't being an adult bring responsibilities? Isn't unable to protect themselves the reason why we protect kids? She has so many options to just not do sex if she wants marriage with sex. She can say no, she can break up, she can complain if her bf still tries to force sex. And even if she is not able to do all this and she is dumb she can keep friends in loop or her family. Relationship needs some ability, it's not all roses and flowers. And if they are not even able to keep friends or family in loop i don't think they should be in a relationship.\n\n\n\n\nI agree tho that fixing enforcement and mentality is more important. But honestly it's next to impossible. U know Air quality index in India is so bad that no matter where u are living your air quality is equivalent to smoking 1 cigarette a day, people don't care their newborns are smoking 1 or more cigarettes a day by just breathing air. People are not waking up for this. Do u think they are gona wake up for being better?",
        "No I have no hopes of it getting better. Global warming will take us out in maybe a generation or two. But until then understand the person, share expectations and only then get into relations. That's the way.",
        "or maybe both are serious issues that need to be tackled? \n\nBy stating the fact that women are more likely to be raped than men are to be accused of false rape cases, doesn't make the false rape cases go away.\n\nWhy cant we treat both issues seriously ?",
        "One could be easily tackled with evidences and right investigations. The other is a long lasting effect including death.",
        "I was molested by a woman i considered my sister when i was 14 years old. She worked as our maid and sexually assaulted me twice. I told my family who told the cops who did nothing except talk to her mother (she was an adult, 20ish) who apologised to me and that was that. I went through a lot with my only 'justice' being a sorry. \n\nSo yeah, I've very much had that experience and i would not wish it on my worst enemy nor would i want someone innocent to be accused of something so vile and rotten.\n\nAnd before you make more strawman attacks, i also work with an NGO that helps women who suffer domestic violence, predatory divorces and also victims of rape. I hope this makes me qualified enough to talk about this subject for you? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan we please put sharp words aside and talk with respect and not hate ? I'm not here for a 'gotcha' moment, nor am i saying you are wrong. But saying that false rape cases can just be solved easy peasy with right investigations (a fine dream in India) misses the larger problem of how many women have weaponized the law to hurt men. \n\nTheres rackets, quite profitable, which eearn money on threats of false rape allegations. And men suffer even after being given a clean chit, once accused of rape society never treats a person the same again (unless they are incredibly rich). \n\nMen have committed suicide (Like a lot of female rape victims who never got justice) due to fake rape cases across the world. They have lost their livelihoods and it takes years for them to receive a semblance of justice. If ever. \n\nPlease don't trivialise this issue.",
        "You might get over your experience (if it truly happened) easily. But most of us can’t. At least she told you sorry. Most girls never got to hear that. Some of us were told to cover up properly after we complained. Some of us don’t even live to tell the tale. Getting falsely accused of rape is far better than that. \n\nLol. I didn’t know you should be employed at NGO to talk about domestic violence or sexual assault. So much for strawman attacks.",
        ">If a guy falsely accuse me of rape, I would get a lawyer, prove my innocence and then sue him against the accuser for defamation. That’s what a\n\nEasier said than done. Our courts aren't known for their speed and till then the person has to face society. Easier said than done. This isn't a movie, things don't move so quickly or so efficiently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  If a woman can do it, why can’t you? \n\nThere are many support groups and institutions in place for women to seek justice, nowhere near the same support for men. And the simple fact that any case takes years to reach the courts. Not all have the patience or the will to go through repeated harassment until the last hearing.  Not everyone is as strong as the woman you knew, be it men or women. I see similar cases in women going through divorce cases who give up the fight after years or decades fighting for justice with no avail. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Not trivializing    \n>  \n>  I’m sorry but getting falsely accused of rape is a trivial thing \n\nHmm...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> how many men exactly killed themselves over this? Very few. Actually I believe only guy did that \n\nSo we should wait until a lot more men kill themselves to take action on this issue ? What number of deaths would justify its importance to you? Or should we wait until it becomes a massive problem like rapes became ? When action was only taken post nirbhaya? A 16 year old kid killed himself after being falsely accused of rape. He was bullied relentlessly leading to him jumping off of the 11th floor. If you think this is trivial then I think this discussion should end here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  I’m sorry but getting falsely accused of rape is a trivial thing \n\nYou should be sorry. It's not trivial to the people who killed themselves. The families it uprooted, the parents who died of stress trying to save their sons. Its funny how you can see the pain caused by men raping women but cant notice the same when caused to men over false rape allegations. You definitely should be sorry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> You might get over your experience (if it truly happened) easily \n\nIf you haven't been assaulted you don't know. You just don't. It was not easy. And a sorry forced out does nothing to help. God forbid you ever have to go through this, you'll see a half-hearted sorry does nothing but sting more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  Getting falsely accused of rape is far better than that. \n\nIt is. Being a rape victim is worse than being falsely accused of rape any day of the week. No doubt about it. But it still is a major problem. Not one we should ignore or trivialise. Being murdered is worse than being mugged. Does that mean we stop caring about the latter  and only focus on the former ? Why cant we work to solve both issues and treat both seriously ?",
        "So if courts aren’t speed, how can you stop anyone from falsely accusing you? Hm? \n\nAs someone who went through such experience, you definitely don’t know what’s it’s like and you’re not qualified enough. \n\nSo you know that even women has to go through hardship at courts yet, society and court has to bend their backs and shouldn’t falsely accuse men because they are fragile. Lol.",
        ">So if courts aren’t speed, how can you stop anyone from falsely accusing you? Hm?\n\nYou finally get it. This is something a lot of men are worried about. Any woman can accuse a guy of rape and with how slow the courts are, you have to face society which will treat you like shit based on accusation alone. Unless you are rich and influential.\n\nThis is exactly how some rackets work btw.

Its easier for women to gain access than men can, hell there's barely any such support system for men, let alone at the scale women have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That’s why I know being falsely accused of rape is not as bad as you think.\n\nHow is it not bad when people have killed themselves over it ? families have been torn apart, parents died of stress ? I have no idea how you can justify fake accusations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>People are being falsely accused of not just rape, theft, corruption and murder. Tell me is falsely accused of murder worse than falsely accused of rape.\n\nIf a woman accuses me of murder the courts and society at large will at least ask for some evidence. Same for theft. But rape ? doesn't matter if you are a paragon of virtue, women are believed when they accuse someone of rape because it is unbelievable that a woman would falsely accuse someone, but the fact is it does happen.\n\nOfcourse being falsely accused of murder is a more severe thing. But justice is more than just the judiciary it includes how society treats someone. Fake accusations of murder or theft arent taken nearly as seriously as rape.",
        "No, you are not getting it. EVERYONE can be falsely accused of anything. Why is it men being falsely accused so special here?",
        "> EVERYONE can be falsely accused of anything. Why is it men being falsely accused so special here? You can be falsely accused of being murdered and the punishment much severe than when you’re accused of being rape. Why aren’t you so concerned about that? \n\nBecause like ive said, the consequences of false accusations are not just judicial but also societal. Society treats people accused of murder and theft differently than those of rape. A person accused of murder or theft still has people giving them benefit of doubt or being open to understanding not guilty before proven to be but with rape ? nope. You are treated as a philadering rapist. That is why you see men accused of rape deciding to end themselves more than you see men accused of theft or murder. Society judges you before the courts can and it never changes it mind. Which is why in the scams women don't threaten to accuse of theft but of rape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you know the rate of sexual assaults going unreported in India is over 90%? Many women are scared to report it fearing the shame, fearing the threats from their rapists and the police hesitant to take up their complaints seriously or even using that excuse to further sexually abuse the victim. Now in a country, where rape victims are shamed why would a woman falsely accuse someone of rape. Something doesn’t add up. \n\nBecause we live in two India. One that does not get its basic rights and one that abuses its rights. Just like how we still have casteist attacks and sc/st people deprived of their legal rights and at the same time some who threaten others and weapons SC/ST act over fake sc/st cases. \n\nYes a lot of women do not report rape and this is a major issue,but that doesn't mean fake cases can't exist. They do. Fake rape accusations exist and they hurt people."

An innocent man doesn't deserve to be punished because he belongs to a gender which does more crimes. Why even get into situations like this? Understand the person and then get into relations... Belive me no one gets into this knowingly. And tbh with the intelligence level of males in India i don't think majority of them are even capable of dodging such bullets. Still unfair laws should be repelled don't u think? You should explain why did you come to the conclusion that I am projecting first. Lol Bro u seriously said this? Seriously? Lol i am done talking to u. >If you actually believe in gender equality, you would understand women getting raped is more serious problem than getting falsely accused. Bro u seriously said this? Seriously? Lol i am done talking to u. That should honestly be more important, fixing our mentality in general. Yes, there should be laws for male abuse idk why it's not the case. And yes it's biased towards women. Question is, what if an actual victim doesn't get justice if laws like this are repealed? I see your point but doesn't being an adult bring responsibilities? Isn't unable to protect themselves the reason why we protect kids? She has so many options to just not do sex if she wants marriage with sex. She can say no, she can break up, she can complain if her bf still tries to force sex. And even if she is not able to do all this and she is dumb she can keep friends in loop or her family. Relationship needs some ability, it's not all roses and flowers. And if they are not even able to keep friends or family in loop i don't think they should be in a relationship. I agree tho that fixing enforcement and mentality is more important. But honestly it's next to impossible. U know Air quality index in India is so bad that no matter where u are living your air quality is equivalent to smoking 1 cigarette a day, people don't care their newborns are smoking 1 or more cigarettes a day by just breathing air. People are not waking up for this. Do u think they are gona wake up for being better? No I have no hopes of it getting better. Global warming will take us out in maybe a generation or two. But until then understand the person, share expectations and only then get into relations. That's the way. or maybe both are serious issues that need to be tackled? By stating the fact that women are more likely to be raped than men are to be accused of false rape cases, doesn't make the false rape cases go away. Why cant we treat both issues seriously ? One could be easily tackled with evidences and right investigations. The other is a long lasting effect including death. I was molested by a woman i considered my sister when i was 14 years old. She worked as our maid and sexually assaulted me twice. I told my family who told the cops who did nothing except talk to her mother (she was an adult, 20ish) who apologised to me and that was that. I went through a lot with my only 'justice' being a sorry. So yeah, I've very much had that experience and i would not wish it on my worst enemy nor would i want someone innocent to be accused of something so vile and rotten. And before you make more strawman attacks, i also work with an NGO that helps women who suffer domestic violence, predatory divorces and also victims of rape. I hope this makes me qualified enough to talk about this subject for you? &#x200B; Can we please put sharp words aside and talk with respect and not hate ? I'm not here for a 'gotcha' moment, nor am i saying you are wrong. But saying that false rape cases can just be solved easy peasy with right investigations (a fine dream in India) misses the larger problem of how many women have weaponized the law to hurt men. Theres rackets, quite profitable, which eearn money on threats of false rape allegations. And men suffer even after being given a clean chit, once accused of rape society never treats a person the same again (unless they are incredibly rich). Men have committed suicide (Like a lot of female rape victims who never got justice) due to fake rape cases across the world. They have lost their livelihoods and it takes years for them to receive a semblance of justice. If ever. Please don't trivialise this issue. You might get over your experience (if it truly happened) easily. But most of us can’t. At least she told you sorry. Most girls never got to hear that. Some of us were told to cover up properly after we complained. Some of us don’t even live to tell the tale. Getting falsely accused of rape is far better than that. Lol. I didn’t know you should be employed at NGO to talk about domestic violence or sexual assault. So much for strawman attacks. >If a guy falsely accuse me of rape, I would get a lawyer, prove my innocence and then sue him against the accuser for defamation. That’s what a Easier said than done. Our courts aren't known for their speed and till then the person has to face society. Easier said than done. This isn't a movie, things don't move so quickly or so efficiently. &#x200B; > If a woman can do it, why can’t you? There are many support groups and institutions in place for women to seek justice, nowhere near the same support for men. And the simple fact that any case takes years to reach the courts. Not all have the patience or the will to go through repeated harassment until the last hearing. Not everyone is as strong as the woman you knew, be it men or women. I see similar cases in women going through divorce cases who give up the fight after years or decades fighting for justice with no avail. &#x200B; > Not trivializing > > I’m sorry but getting falsely accused of rape is a trivial thing Hmm... &#x200B; > how many men exactly killed themselves over this? Very few. Actually I believe only guy did that So we should wait until a lot more men kill themselves to take action on this issue ? What number of deaths would justify its importance to you? Or should we wait until it becomes a massive problem like rapes became ? When action was only taken post nirbhaya? A 16 year old kid killed himself after being falsely accused of rape. He was bullied relentlessly leading to him jumping off of the 11th floor. If you think this is trivial then I think this discussion should end here. &#x200B; > I’m sorry but getting falsely accused of rape is a trivial thing You should be sorry. It's not trivial to the people who killed themselves. The families it uprooted, the parents who died of stress trying to save their sons. Its funny how you can see the pain caused by men raping women but cant notice the same when caused to men over false rape allegations. You definitely should be sorry. &#x200B; > You might get over your experience (if it truly happened) easily If you haven't been assaulted you don't know. You just don't. It was not easy. And a sorry forced out does nothing to help. God forbid you ever have to go through this, you'll see a half-hearted sorry does nothing but sting more &#x200B; > Getting falsely accused of rape is far better than that. It is. Being a rape victim is worse than being falsely accused of rape any day of the week. No doubt about it. But it still is a major problem. Not one we should ignore or trivialise. Being murdered is worse than being mugged. Does that mean we stop caring about the latter and only focus on the former ? Why cant we work to solve both issues and treat both seriously ? So if courts aren’t speed, how can you stop anyone from falsely accusing you? Hm? As someone who went through such experience, you definitely don’t know what’s it’s like and you’re not qualified enough. So you know that even women has to go through hardship at courts yet, society and court has to bend their backs and shouldn’t falsely accuse men because they are fragile. Lol. >So if courts aren’t speed, how can you stop anyone from falsely accusing you? Hm? You finally get it. This is something a lot of men are worried about. Any woman can accuse a guy of rape and with how slow the courts are, you have to face society which will treat you like shit based on accusation alone. Unless you are rich and influential. This is exactly how some rackets work btw.

Shouldn't falsely accuse because fake accusations are morally wrong and disgusting. &#x200B; >not every woman has access to these support system. More women have access to such support systems than men do. Its easier for women to gain access than men can, hell there's barely any such support system for men, let alone at the scale women have. &#x200B; >That’s why I know being falsely accused of rape is not as bad as you think. How is it not bad when people have killed themselves over it ? families have been torn apart, parents died of stress ? I have no idea how you can justify fake accusations. &#x200B; >People are being falsely accused of not just rape, theft, corruption and murder. Tell me is falsely accused of murder worse than falsely accused of rape. If a woman accuses me of murder the courts and society at large will at least ask for some evidence. Same for theft. But rape ? doesn't matter if you are a paragon of virtue, women are believed when they accuse someone of rape because it is unbelievable that a woman would falsely accuse someone, but the fact is it does happen. Ofcourse being falsely accused of murder is a more severe thing. But justice is more than just the judiciary it includes how society treats someone. Fake accusations of murder or theft arent taken nearly as seriously as rape. No, you are not getting it. EVERYONE can be falsely accused of anything. Why is it men being falsely accused so special here? > EVERYONE can be falsely accused of anything. Why is it men being falsely accused so special here? You can be falsely accused of being murdered and the punishment much severe than when you’re accused of being rape. Why aren’t you so concerned about that? Because like ive said, the consequences of false accusations are not just judicial but also societal. Society treats people accused of murder and theft differently than those of rape. A person accused of murder or theft still has people giving them benefit of doubt or being open to understanding not guilty before proven to be but with rape ? nope. You are treated as a philadering rapist. That is why you see men accused of rape deciding to end themselves more than you see men accused of theft or murder. Society judges you before the courts can and it never changes it mind. Which is why in the scams women don't threaten to accuse of theft but of rape. &#x200B; >Do you know the rate of sexual assaults going unreported in India is over 90%? Many women are scared to report it fearing the shame, fearing the threats from their rapists and the police hesitant to take up their complaints seriously or even using that excuse to further sexually abuse the victim. Now in a country, where rape victims are shamed why would a woman falsely accuse someone of rape. Something doesn’t add up. Because we live in two India. One that does not get its basic rights and one that abuses its rights. Just like how we still have casteist attacks and sc/st people deprived of their legal rights and at the same time some who threaten others and weapons SC/ST act over fake sc/st cases. Yes a lot of women do not report rape and this is a major issue,but that doesn't mean fake cases can't exist. They do. Fake rape accusations exist and they hurt people."
