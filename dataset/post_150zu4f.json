You are weird .\n\nThe next part of your sentence is even more baffling , obviously the conditions for an African cheetah and Indian cheetah are different. I don't know what studies they did to conclude that they could adapt , but those cheetah didn't die due adaptability. \n\nThey died to a never seen before issue due to he collars . So the environment factor that you are using isn't a very strong argument .",

This whole thing was a decent attempt at reintroduction of cheetas , if not for the collars maybe the cheetas would have survived and also bred sucessful.\n\nThe only complaint i ahve is why the Indian vets missed the collar maggot and dermitis in their postmortem .\n\nI only question the medical credential of the vets being used.\n\n\nYou can argue politics with someone else I'm not interested in that mud wrestling.",

All the money collected for their upkeep and the heavy ticket sales all seems to have been wasted. Letting these animals die of neglect is just is disgrace for all Indians, and particularly for all involved in bringing them to India and managing their stay in India If you been to zoo in overseas animals are taken care like babies with a very hygiene environment then again this in India where humans themselves are treated badly by other humans , cabt expect animals treat any better Didn't some politician from Maharashtra bring penguins which survive only in cold temperatures to India for amusement n they end up dying in artificial weather, pretty much sums up the attitude towards animals n birds here How many remain? at this point, I've lost the count. The photo ops is done. Assholes have points to make in conversation on train, in bus in office or at tapri. Who cares about followups. A lot of urban indians deserve their shitty lives. Can't tell. First they brought few, later second batch arrived. Few gave birth in india and those cubs died within days. 3 out of the total 11 Criminal to get them here Headline should say, “india did not look after the cheetahs and there they died” Almight God is responsible don’t worry /s How did the vets in India not find this ........ On the plus side it means they didn't die due to their inability to adapt , maybe for the next batch of cheetas they can adopt different measures. That's horrible 😭 >Of the total 20 borrowed cheetahs, India has lost five so far and out of four cubs born to a female cheetah in March, three have already succumbed to starvation and heat. From the article. It's funny how people commenting here obviously did not read the article, all the while they blame the government of incompetence and laziness. I hate these collars and other monitoring devices. I am not at all surprised that they have caused harm. When they capture snow leopards they tag their ears with green fluorescent tags *to make them easier to spot* well guess what genius Einstein scientists that means the snow leopard’s prey can easily see them too. When are humans going to give wildlife space and just leave it alone? Time to call cheetahs anti national /s 👍 I heard 8. Worst of worst politicians and bureaucrats are in our country. This is so sad. What was even the point of bringing them here?!! I read the article, can you point out which part shows that the government wasn't at fault? Must be 5 imported and 3 cubs. That makes 8. You do understand that making those cheetas adapt to wild means minimal interference , they can't keep sedating them and then check every part of their body every week or something . Even the expert in the article admitted in Africa the collars aren't a problem due to lack of rain and this is something observed for the first time . This was the first batch of cheetas in a reintroduction effort , obviously they have to have some form of tracking to get data if they can survive or not , what if they drank water from some infected source or something, the location data helps for such deductions. Maybe for the next government, you can adopt different measures and start voting for something other than nationalism and religion. Next batch of cheetahs, he says. Just use apple air tag? /s It's unbelievably amazing how people keep replying to me and deleting their comments saying vote for this government and that government, you people need to get your heads out of your asses . Not every comment is political , my comment is purely targetting the cause fo the cheetas deaths and how such a mistake can be avoided the next time . Just because you noobs get excited to make everything political it doesn't have to be that way. Would you “reintroduce” the Nile crocodile to make up for extinct Gharial populations? Let’s not lose sight of how stupid this idea was to begin with If they have similar traits and the environmental and food source factors are sufficient for their population expansion why not , then again I would not do so on a whim , I would wait for the wildlife department to make a comprehensive analysis report , which neither you or i am > Even the expert in the article admitted in Africa the collars aren't a problem due to lack of rain and this is something observed for the first time . That right there is called **fucking incompetence** Which is why you can’t take an animal evolved to live in the dry savanna and drop it into a subtropical jungle biome (even if the jungle has been cleared away into grasslands now) > which neither you or i am Let’s not forget modi. I doubt “relocation of endangered animals into new biomes with minimal research” was covered under ‘Entire Political Science’ Really sad. Though Cheetahs even in Africa are really bottom tier animals, only place they might thrive in my opinion is Australia. Checkout Tier Zoo video on how Cheetah's are F tier. Uhhhh even the African expert didn't anticipate the problem , he is incompetent I agree . I don't know what you are standing to gain by highlighting it . You are weird . The next part of your sentence is even more baffling , obviously the conditions for an African cheetah and Indian cheetah are different. I don't know what studies they did to conclude that they could adapt , but those cheetah didn't die due adaptability. They died to a never seen before issue due to he collars . So the environment factor that you are using isn't a very strong argument . Look man I'm not going into the politics aspect that's your own muddy water . You can drown in it for all i care To me only the forest department aspect matters . This whole thing was a decent attempt at reintroduction of cheetas , if not for the collars maybe the cheetas would have survived and also bred sucessful. The only complaint i ahve is why the Indian vets missed the collar maggot and dermitis in their postmortem . I only question the medical credential of the vets being used. You can argue politics with someone else I'm not interested in that mud wrestling. > “These wounds, in my view, are almost certainly not caused by another animal. They’re actually caused by a problem that we actually did not foresee happening, because we collared cheetahs in Africa without any problems,” Mr Tordiffe said. They are still in captivity or semi-wild conditions There will be a Cheeta holocaust if they are sent to actual wild. I am a cat person I love wilds cats as much as an Hindu loves his cow. >If you been to zoo in overseas animals are taken care like babies with a very hygiene environment How does this apply here considering they are not in a zoo ? Buddy trying to sound intelligent, let him have his moment :) You didn't read the article did you ? Neither did 99 people who up-voted you. Considering the entire article is about how radio collar devices which are used to **track and follow-up on cheetahs,** are probable reason for their death because the said radio is causing them dermatitis a problem that didn't arise in Africa. The autopsy by an international expert and the team monitoring them seem to have a good idea of health of every cheetahs, considering they have one who cheetah with a fractured bone under their care. Their seems to be plenty of follow up to me, probably more could be done. >A lot of urban indians deserve their shitty lives. Ngl this is totally random raging, at least curse the right people. I am 99% certain none of the top up-voted comments read the article. >This is so sad. What was even the point of bringing them here?!! Reintroduction is part of conservation efforts and efforts had been made since 1980s and serious efforts since 2009. Cheeta jihad?!?! Did I say the collars are not the cause? Why are you offended? Are you one of the asshole making the points during random conversations? It is about your dear leader making a PR fest out of every thing he does and doesn’t follow up with it properly afterwards, keeping mum on serious issues. If the collars are the cause, why has it taken so many deaths to arrive at the conclusion? Where is the accountability by the national teams? Why wasn’t the research into rehabilitation of these poor animals not done prior to bringing them here? More than that why haven’t you, dear bhakts not raised questions? Does nothing convince you? Do you have so short memory that you do not recall that the medical system needs extensive inputs in terms of capital and capacity? What happened to that? That the education system is basically Ram bharose for the masses you appease? That the irrigation system is non existent so that every year you have floods in one part of the country and droughts in another? Sometimes at the same time. That so many people you see are living in abject condition without a safety net and are one accident or misfortune away from poverty and death? That so much human capital is lost due above reasons and much more? The question is about accountability. And it doesn’t come with implementing mindless agendas just to project strength and lustre, it comes from what you lack… power to question. Learn it. They are coming for you too… and your devotion or deep pockets wont save you. >Why are you offended? Are you one of the asshole making the points during random conversations? Because it's obvious that you didn't read the said article, neither did OP nor did most upvoted comments. The asshole here are the people commenting that nobody cares when it seems obvious that a fairly engaged team is involved but nah gotta pretend we know what's up. FYI, the success of the project is 50% survival [https://www.indiaspend.com/earthcheckindia/deaths-runaways-space-crunch-is-indias-cheetah-project-on-the-right-track-864502#:\\~:text=The%20government's%20criteria%20for%20the,and%20F1%20generation%2D%2Dthat](https://www.indiaspend.com/earthcheckindia/deaths-runaways-space-crunch-is-indias-cheetah-project-on-the-right-track-864502#:~:text=The%20government's%20criteria%20for%20the,and%20F1%20generation%2D%2Dthat) &#x200B; > Why wasn’t the research into rehabilitation of these poor animals not done prior to bringing them here?

Starvation???? They let them literally starve to death? Wish that the politicians that brought the Cheetahs got maggots instead. so is the success rate of this nation it seems on a good day for less than that percentage of people. Btw, why is success rate of 50% acceptable? What about the success rate for two years? Since you seem to be an expert on this, enlighten us how do we plan to reintroduce these animals in our great nation with 50% rate for the first year… what about the limited gene pool… if the plan is to hope for new cubs… Maybe that’s why there was a pause on the program? That this rate of success doesn’t warrant investing in such projects. And ofcourse you cannot speak on other topics because… that would require some serious gymnastics. You see there’s a pattern to folks like you, first you use concocted data, then strawman, whataboutery… then you go ad hominem. Some of us do know your patterns, and will call you out. You can fool the masses, you can buy, intimidate or just plain braiwash some for the cause of greater good. But we know you. We see you. And we are here. The actual purpose for which they were brought here was served when they were brought here. >Btw, why is success rate of 50% acceptable? What about the success rate for two years? Oh god ask the conservationist or read the 330 page action plan [https://wii.gov.in/images/images/documents/publications/action\\_plan\\_cheetah\\_introduction\\_jan\\_2022.pdf](https://wii.gov.in/images/images/documents/publications/action_plan_cheetah_introduction_jan_2022.pdf), considering you didn't read 3 pages long article it's a tough ask but try anyways. it's a given cheetahs would take time to adapt to a new location. &#x200B; >And ofcourse you cannot speak on other topics because… that would require some serious gymnastics. No because there are limits to how random a thread about wildlife conservation should be allowed to get, you are like the uncle that screams \"Siachen mai humare jawan lad rahe hain\" to borrow an analogy of Kunal kumra, **stick to the topic at hand.** >But we know you. We see you. And we are here. We being people low at reading skills ? Can't say I care. Yeah, if any are left alive. I’ll read and be back. I said zoo in general The whole project was asinine to start with. Introducing a species that is entirely acclimated to a different environment, pathogens, food habits, temperatures and just releasing them into the wild is moronic. Asiatic cheetahs, if they ever existed as a viable species, haven't been in Indian forests for centuries. And the climate itself has changed since then. Wasting money on introducing novel species instead of trying to conserve what we do have and encouraging the spread of those animals that have become limited is the dumbest shit. Our entire conservation effort seems to be run by a bunch of jackasses. You and I both know you won't, you are too indolent for that. why no media coverage? because when they came it was everywhere They let the cubs literally starve to death... >because we collared cheetahs in Africa without any problems, So the people who did it here did a bad job. >the said radio is causing them dermatitis a problem that didn't arise in Africa. Why do you think that happened here? Collars weigh 400 gms each. WTF??.. Are these collars similar to the ones used for Tigers and lions?.. If they are, forest officers who took this decision should be prosecuted. Average Indian has nearly zero empathy for animals unless it’s a street dog or a cow and I say this as a right-leaning fellow. It’s too sad. The died of dehydration not starving, as to why is because their mother is still adapting to her new environment. This is a wildlife relocation not a zoo, where forest officials would feed every cheetah, getting them to adapt to their environment is part of the process that's why only 50% mortality rate was expected for these cheetahs even before they got here. Unfortunate yes but long term success is bound by this starting pains. Honestly, I hope this project fails, feel for the Cheetahs but if that will shame and embarrass the Indian Modi government internationally then so be it Poor cheetahs.., media will obviously blame some conspiracy >Why do you think that happened here? The guy who had done the autopsy here is with Africat project of Namibia, I would say he knows his stuff. :- >“These wounds, in my view, are almost certainly not caused by another animal. They’re actually caused by a problem that we actually did not foresee happening, because we collared cheetahs in Africa without any problems,” Mr Tordiffe said.

I am hoping they searching desperately for an alternative, but [this](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/reports-attributing-some-cheetah-deaths-to-radio-collar-use-speculative-govt-1237553.html) latest article isn't giving me much hope although it seem more of a case of bureaucratic slowness rather than outright negligence. > This whole thing was a decent attempt at reintroduction of cheetas It's still too early to call it a failure, this is just the first batch and new cheetahs are supposed to be introduced almost every year for a decade. Yeah I'm hoping it will be a success Told you, you’d go full ad hominem. And you did. Fuck off asshole. The cheetas outgrew their collars. They weren't adult Animals in the wild do starve to death. It happens. Especially since wildlife has become extremely depleted and restricted to limited spaces in the modern world. > Bringing them here and letting them die due to negligence is extremely sad. They were not brought here as exotic pets. lol. Please understand the process of relocation or introducing Cheeta in India is a very long, time consuming and a complex process. That said, cheeta is difficult animal to relocate. You cant just set them free in a jungle expect them to thrive. Whole process takes a while to show results. Totally agree with you. Relocating cheeta isn't easy. Cheetah are notorious about the whole process. It takes time for them to adapt to new conditions. Exactly, these aren’t natural wild animals though. Introducing an animal without enough food for it, you might as well just euthanize it before it arrives As I said elsewhere here, the whole project is idiotic. I'm not against introducing animals from other regions. But this is a species that is literally not from the same continent. Climate, geography, temperate, humidity, flora, fauna, everything is different from them. Yep, more appropriate for a zoo or something not a preserve Bringing them here was to catch eyeballs. Keeping them healthy is unglamorous and that is not a selling point. Elect clowns, expect circus. You're not serious, are you? >“These wounds, in my view, are almost certainly not caused by another animal. They’re actually caused by a problem that we actually did not foresee happening, because we collared cheetahs in Africa without any problems,” Mr Tordiffe said. **But very wet weather, which he says extends over a number of days within the Indian monsoon, caused a problem with the skin underneath the collar**. If they didn't foresee monsoon, they haven't really done sufficient preparation for moving the cheetahs. Bawahahahahahahahahhahaha That is so horrible and disturbing. Let them be, why collar them and let their skin be so horribly infected, if you are incompetent??? Just shut up man. Don't wish death upon those creatures. This government is already an international shame. I am just wondering if there is a tracking device and somebody might be was checking them I am physically, didn't they care to check under the collar? Didn't cheetah used to live in India in past like 100 years ago, jungle is very much same. What changed? Jab paal nahi sakte they to peda kyu kara /s Yeah. Don't People call that politician penguine now. The Cheetah project was a favour done by Namibia to India for helping to lift the international ban on ivory trade which Namibia is a big part of. Ivory trade is notorious for the amount of elephants it gets killed. So this whole project was a sham. It is a very sad fact of how things are, They were asiatic cheetah which evolved here and knew how to police here. Also landscape has changed considerably since then Isn't irony doing so much of TRP done. Bur when they are dying no media did coverage or raise qst. Supreme court also said if MP govt has problem better to shift them, but ego of one person and govt, almost 8 cheetah deaths. No, they won’t survive Australia, because of a shortage of prey for them kangaroos It was such a ridiculous experiment as well. Only done to satiate Guajarati govt greed in wanting to be only place in India with Asiatic Lions. When Madhya Pradesh originally asked for Asiatic Lions they were refused and Centre govt came up with this scheme to get African Cheetahs instead. did you ever drink car pee? Exactly such shitty play by Centre and Gujrat almost as if they are related iykyk Yk why To block Kuno from getting Asiatic Lions from Gir To block Kuno from getting Asiatic lions"
