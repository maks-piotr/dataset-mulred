        "Interesting that Kakrapar reactors were derived from [CANDU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor?wprov=sfla1), the technology that Canada sold to India, and eventually paved the way for successful nuclear arms development by Indian scientists. It's sad to see the relationship between these two nations spiral down due to politics. Also, good to know that the development of these two reactors was done during UPA period.",
        "The world called for an \"embargo\" when India demonstrated its nuke capabilities. They banned all export of nuclear materials and technology to India. This was a blessing in disguise for India. India was forced to develop their own technology and explored thorium based reactors. Now,  India is leading the world in this technology (see India's three-stage nuclear power programme). \n\n\nNow, even japanese scientists requested Indian scientists for help in the aftermath of Fukushima disaster. ",
        "Wouldn't quite say India is leading when we're still importing pressure vessels and other components from Russia for most of our reactors. And while our Breeder Reactor program is touted to be one of the world's most advanced, it seems to be quite slow. I mean, the PFBR has suffered years upon years worth of delays. No comparison to China's Fast Breeder and Molten Salt reactor program, which is currently the only MSR program moving at a good pace.\n\nWe're definitely still behind China, France, Russia and SK without a doubt. Our nuclear fusion program is also far, far behind countries like US, Japan and China apart from us being a part of ITER.",
        "Well, India also has the only thorium based working reactor in the world, and would soon have a thorium FBR and MSR as well. Though I agree that we need to catch up a lot in fusion tech.",
        "Reminded me that Microsoft & Amazon are investing in nuclear power in the US to support AI which is power hungry. This is a significant change because the public opinion in the US has been anti-nuclear for a long time. Also it is very expensive to stand up a new nuclear power plant and takes years. So these are mega projects 👍🏼",
        "While you're right overall I would like to point out that it was Google who ordered mini nuclear plants recently and not Microsoft or Amazon.",
        "And there will be strikes in those reactor and they will burn for years like Fukushima.",

        "no real commercial thorium reactor exists. it is still theoretical.",
        "Nuclear is way better than solar",
        "It would be a game-changer for us to get to functioning, ultra-safe, ultra-efficient thorium nuclear reactors. Build a ton of them, start by knocking out all the coal-fired nonsense that currently powers a lot of NCR, that region should be one of the first ones to get nuclear-powered.",
        "10 in process, I have to say that India is the only country which can take such a massive step to clean energy at once.",
        ">India also has the only thorium based working reactor in the world\n\nOh Sir, please pray tell, where did you hear about this?\n\nAs far as I know, I follow these developments farily regularly, there are no working thorium or molten salt reactors in the world, all are either research projects or are in talks of development. Please don't make claims which can't be backed. Even doing a simple google search doesn't say india has a working thorium reactor.",
        "Why doesn’t the article list them out?",
        "Nice, more targets for PAF flying bastards to destroy..",
        "So you would rather not have reactors? Tf are you on?",

        "What about KAMINI?",
        "Kamini went critical recently, after huge delays. Surprised that the media hasn't blasted it everywhere.",
