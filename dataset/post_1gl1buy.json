        "Is this a mandatory exercise by the government of India ? What importance is it, if ignored to fill the data?",
        "APAAR is a good initiative...aadhar don't save the educational details of the people....it is currently in development will be a great asset in future.\n\nAPAAR ensures accountability and transparency in education by tracking student progress and streamlining academic records. It enhances efficiency, removes duplicity, minimizes fraud, and includes co-curricular achievements for holistic student development.",
        "Is it mandatory?",
        "Still one can do all these things with Adhaar ID.\nWhat value addition is there by generating new ID number?",
        "As per website, they are saying voluntary.",
        "And what's lacking with PEN number?",
        "Not mandatory but someone will need to go to court to enforce it",
        "Aadhaar is a unique identity system primarily intended for authentication, access to government services, and welfare benefits.  Even though your APAAR number will be connected to your Aaddhar number. \n\nAlso, educational details that you will update quite frequently, whereas you cannot update Aaddhar card twice or thrice. \n\nSeeing this as a programmer, it is easy to manage bifurcated data instead of a single centralized data.",
        "You're probably the guy with the most IQ here",

They are pretty useful in tracking, updating education details and for transfer of credits in college.\n\nIf implemented correctly we don't need to carry physical documents for verification, admissions etc . \n\nMany colleges hold physical documents as hostage and refuse to give them, since original documents are important we would have no choice but to bow before them .this id reduces the risk\n\nSince you have your entire education history available online, you can reduce fraud use of certificates\n\nThese are few use cases that comes to my mind assuming they are implemented correctly",

        "It's due to govt order",
        "Bhau fraud toh kahi bhi ho sakta hai, you can not prevent fraud when the all the parties in the chain want to do fraud. Its so simple. Get a fake aadhar ans a phone number, make an APAAR ID, show the person as an student in the college, then post 3-4 years, change the photo and address with fake verification documents and then sell the degree with the years and records for 10 lacs.\n\nThis is India, where people are extremely smart in thinking and doing wrong things.\n\nNo level of oversight can prevent this cause the people only are like this.\n\nParties to this contract:\nSchool administration/Agents/Fake degree applicants\n/Aadhar center agents/Fake documents producers.\n\nWhat can the govt do here. If the primary person verifying the details, schools admin is party to fraud.\nNot like this wasn't happening before, we have loads lf cases of fake degrees being sold. That was a paper based and local ledger. Same details on APAAR would be computer based and in e-form. \n\nThar is definitely better than carrying hard copies of passing certificate, mark sheets and other documents, for the non-fraudulemt population (majoriry of us like 99%, cause 1% of fraudster is still 1.4 cr people).",
        "Aadhar is a Primary key in a database. This APAAR/Pen is a secondary key in the database only for that keys educational detail.\n\nLike DL has a DL number, voter ID has a Voter Number, Ration card has a Ration card number. They all are separate areas linked by aadhar Primary key.",
        "CBSE and UGC and Govt university also send the same data to the govt but its not that interactive or thatich interlinked. \n\nThey already know which child is doing what, in which college, with what marks. But this will be found out when they put up a request to fetch data frok different sources.\n\nOnce you link it up, its just put the aadhar number and you kundli is there. Easier access to data for all parties involved and digitisation of records are the main objective of the exercise. That was the whole idea of aadhar-non financial data, PAN-Financial data.",
        "I was forced by my university to enroll in this. I was probably one of the last people to do it. They threatened me in the end if I don't do it.",

        "A single database allows for informed decision relating of the people of the country. Better statistics as the data is collected first hand in real-time. Better implementation of govt policies as they are based on the data of the recipients. \n\nIn short Big data analytics. This has lots of uses for governance and planning. The same way it benefits For profits businesses, in providing insights.\n\nLike there so many inference that you can take out from IT data relating to 1.5 cr taxpayers. The types of income, the source, the method of collection, the buildup of X type of income in an area. How should policies be set up for taxation. How should states favour their locations where income generation is heavy, so that more income is generated and hence more tax.\n\nLike I'd love get the GST data made public as well. Like state wise/district wise/citywise and industry wise. That would show which district is doing good by how much, where all are industry hubs. Which area is doing business with which area, where can we open new industrial areas, which hubs need relocation, which areas can be linked to make a connected hub.\n\nWhat are the general purchase ratios to profits, what are service expense ratio to profits. Cause we know profits from MCA portal, and if we get GST purchase data from GST.\n\nIt could help people set up new business based on proximity to their vertical companies.\n\nThis also helps in Identifying fraud, fake invoicing due to abnormal operations wrt to area and industry.\n\nSecondly, ease of access to data to the individuals. No need for hard copies. Everything is in e-form.\n\nThe only downside is Hacking/DDOS attacks.",

Then they made it so you had to connect it to Aadhaar for it to be acceptable anywhere.  \n\nThere was a time it could be used as a PoI, now I see even that is being eroded and its not acceptable as a PoI in many cases. I wouldn't be surprised if they kill PAN entirely within the next 10-15 years.",
        "What better data protections? People got admin access to their production database by paying 500 Rs, and the UIDAI's response in court was to talk about the height and width of the walls around their data center. \n\nI can guarantee you, every Chinese intelligence officer has an up to date copy of the database on their servers. I often joke that we don't need to keep backups of Aaadhaar because if our DB is ever corrupted, we can always ask the Chinese to give us their copy.",

But this will be found out when they put up a request to fetch data from different sources.\n\nThat problem has a known solution: a data warehouse/lakehouse. We've enough data engineers in the country that could build a solution to make that happen without needing to issue a whole new ID to every student of the country.",
        "Why do you need APAAR for digital versions of passing certificates? You already have that on Digilocker right now.",
        "If an Aadhaar-PEN is a 1:1 relation (which it should be as both pertain to the same individual) then you do not need to issue an ID. The student can quote Aadhaar, you lookup the PEN in the database. Which in turn would reveal that the PEN is entirely unnecessary, the primary key of the educational record can be the Aadhaar ID. \n\nYour DL and Voter ID examples don't hold, because those systems predate Aadhaar and therefore their databases were not designed with Aadhaar in mind. Aadhaar has been positioned as the overarching ID, so newly designed systems don't need to use their own IDs.",
        "> Also, educational details that you will update quite frequently, whereas you cannot update Aaddhar card twice or thrice. \n\nThis is the classic master data/transactional data distinction. This is done in databases today. Your customer details update far slower than order details too for instance. \n\nSingle centralized databases are hard to manage, secure etc I agree - but the principle underlying Aadhaar was precisely to implement that kind of centralization. So if that is the principle, why not adhere to it? Why make citizens run around for this ID and that ID when you explicitly created a single ID to cover all use cases?",
        "You can check your credit score online by just giving your PAN number, you bet government and financial institutions are using PAN to track your financial activities.",
        "They could be - the point is though, I don't see why they couldn't do the same tracking with Aadhaar and get rid of PAN. Every financial instrument you have is likely connected to Aadhaar as well.",
        "I can answer that as a data developer, having one big data source is a bad idea. There needs to be multiple small tables instead of one big table. It is known as Separation of Concerns and modularization. \n\nFrom an outside perspective it looks like Aadhar table is the master table and every other stuff(voter, passport, pan, abha, apaar etc) are child tables with link to the Aadhar table",
        "From an IT architecture perspective it is a bad idea, absolutely. But that bad idea (centralise everything into one ID) is at the very heart of the Aadhaar design. That has been the criticism of the Aadhaar from day one. However, that criticism was always ignored and the govt said they wanted to centralize.\n\nNow we get the worst of both worlds. Every ID has been centralized or linked into a single ID, which makes it easy for the govt and any malicious actor to misuse this data. But the supposed benefit to the citizen (which was that we wouldn't need so many IDs) does not materialize because we continue the proliferation of IDs and the inconvenience to the citizens remains.",
        "So I can show my PP as my identification now? ✊✊✊",
        "By centralisation they mean single database which they are doing, but a single database can have multiple tables.\n\nThat's my educated guess",
        "I think the whole idea was that PAN is kinked with all financial items, and aadhar is linked with all non-financial items. But both PAN and aadhar should be linked as PAN database predates the Aadhar one.\n\nThe other thing is, that PAN/Aadhar will bece the primary key for all database, but each database will have a secondary key as well, like DL license no, Voter Number, APAAR no, CBSE roll no, College admission number etc. The secondary key is for the said institution to navigate the database, but for the individual and govt it will be PAN/Aadhar. \n\nBasically master table, with multiple separate databases owned/managed by separate institutions but controlled on a comman platform.",

        "As per the judgement dated 26-Sep-2018, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, ONLY the CBDT (Central Board of Direct Taxes / Income Tax Department) can demand Aadhaar card from the tax payer.\n\nNO OTHER ENTITY, govt. or private, can demand Aadhaar as mandatory.

    "light_cleaned_title": "New nonsense in the market. APAAR ID for students",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "All including kids have ADHAAR. and then came to know there is another I'd number called PEN (Permanent Education Number) created for students thru schools. Now another ID called Apaar. Why Adhaar is not sufficient for all purpose? Why so many databases are being created?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Is this a mandatory exercise by the government of India ? What importance is it, if ignored to fill the data? APAAR is a good initiative...aadhar don't save the educational details of the people....it is currently in development will be a great asset in future. APAAR ensures accountability and transparency in education by tracking student progress and streamlining academic records. It enhances efficiency, removes duplicity, minimizes fraud, and includes co-curricular achievements for holistic student development. Is it mandatory? Still one can do all these things with Adhaar ID. What value addition is there by generating new ID number? As per website, they are saying voluntary. And what's lacking with PEN number? Not mandatory but someone will need to go to court to enforce it Aadhaar is a unique identity system primarily intended for authentication, access to government services, and welfare benefits. Even though your APAAR number will be connected to your Aaddhar number. Also, educational details that you will update quite frequently, whereas you cannot update Aaddhar card twice or thrice. Seeing this as a programmer, it is easy to manage bifurcated data instead of a single centralized data. You're probably the guy with the most IQ here If I can login to different websites with my Mobile number and OTP, what's wrong with similar implementation thru Aadhaar? Have separate database, but linked to Aadhaar ID Jab aadhaar mai farjiwada ho skta hai toh yai jyda time tak safe nhi rhega Only a matter of time, we will have \"UDHAAR\" id to track loans. Scammers have a new method of stealing citizen's data. Congratulations Yea my school forced it and now idk what will happen STFU dumbo, you need not criticise everything/ Do some research before spewing dumb opinions here and there. Adhaar already stores huge volume of biometrics, adding further functionalities with cause severe performance issue. Also adhhar is governed by adhaar act, therefore your adhaar data can't be shared whereas the data in apaar id cab be shared. Now link your apaar id with aadhar id. >APAAR ensures accountability and transparency in education by tracking student progress and streamlining academic records. Streamlining for whom and for what purpose? Nice explanation. 🙏🙏 State sponsored tracking method I'm gonna leave this here phele education system suhaar le, 12th tak ke bachho ko computer on kaise hota hai nahi pata, when atleast 15 computer are provided in computer lab. hna ye karlo, education system me improvement mat karo. shit india does keep people busy. Mobile OTP is a different thing..it is for authentication not storing data...after you login you get a user id that is linked to your mobile number and then you register yourself to different websites. Just like KYC leaks from various service providers. A new vulnerability is successfully established. The Personal Education Number (PEN) is a unique number that identifies a student, while the Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) is a system that generates an ID card for students What do you think PAN is for? even Aadhaar is also not consider as national id ,you still need many proof to make the things done For students, educational institutions, policymakers. Apaar no and PEN number are both the same . They are pretty useful in tracking, updating education details and for transfer of credits in college. If implemented correctly we don't need to carry physical documents for verification, admissions etc . Many colleges hold physical documents as hostage and refuse to give them, since original documents are important we would have no choice but to bow before them .this id reduces the risk Since you have your entire education history available online, you can reduce fraud use of certificates These are few use cases that comes to my mind assuming they are implemented correctly 90% of initiatives cooked up by bureaucrats and pushed country-wide are pure horseshit when it comes to fulfilling the stated goals. So its mandatory just like aadhar It’s not nonsense actually and takes a minute hardly to generate one, on digi locker Instances of millions of rural, nomadic, destitute, or marginalised individuals being denied basic necessities, such as food rations, and students being refused school admissions for not possessing an Aadhaar card are well-documented. The fear around implementing APAAR ID as a basis for education in India is rooted in these past experiences. 🙏🏼 Excellent point this is just one more administrative hurdle for poor and marginalized people & their children Another way to get data Op is dumb, OP you should do research before posting in \"India's biggest sub\" what is APAAR ID Our clg is kinda serious about it idk why I am from Bhopal . My college faculty pushed a text in the official group chat stating if you're not gonna enroll and sent a screenshot here then you'll not be able to give main exams Here I got the proof . If anything wrong happened to me and my data I am fs gonna blame them for it . A guy in the comments section shares a link of an article. It's concerning now . Never going to fill any form or anything without asking about it Couldn't they just do it themselves instead of asking us to do it. Like can they not just assign a new apaar number automatically. One of the biggest advantages of Adhaar Card was supposed to be streamlining all administrative procedures by introducing a single universal identification. If the Government keeps introducing more such Cards and such, what's the fucking point. Heck the entire Aadhaar system was Garbage then, 81.5 crore Indians Adhaar card data is already on sale in Dark we. Also read the article about apaar on InternetFreedom.in Ok. Can we atleast have PADHAAR? It's a non-optional voluntary id. Can’t be shared but definitely can be leaked. Instead of all this fuckery maybe the government should announce total vacancies in government schools and colleges (atleast the central ones) and when and how they plan to fill those. for college or school student ? >New nonsense in the market >doesnt explain why? >left Lol govt has every right over data /s add krde bhai, bhul gya hoga so why not integrate it with the aadhar platform. why is it that the government wants to create a whole new convoluted and confusing process for every other thing One nation, one student ID. Hmm. What do you think is going on? What are they hiding? Keeping track of the jeslims so when the time is right they know exactly which doors to knock on, like they did in the Netherlands? If they have all the data through aadhar, why do they need another way? This is something else, they're hiding something & I don't like it, I don't trust them Let me say it, they don't plan on filling those cos then the poor & destitute might get an education & learn things & start asking for their rights. Also where is the money going to come from to fill these posts? The middle class is already being squeezed out of every tax rupee & has actually declined. What you think, corporate tax? Ha! Why are they hiding this then? Nah, it seems very sinister Exactly, which is why it comes across as even more sinister. They had the data, my guess is aadhar had better data protections tied to it so they couldn't do what they wanted to do with it. What they wanted to do/ are doing with aapar only they know Lol, no for the govt so they know which child is exactly where Copy pasting my comment from above: My guess is aadhar had better data protections tied to it so they couldn’t do what they wanted to do with it. What they wanted to do/ are doing with aapar only they know Speak nicely Is \"dumb\" IT cells word for the day? What is APAAR? What do you mean right?? No one has the right to make it compulsory to give all your data to some org govts always know which door to knock, gujrat/delhi didn't had appar IDs at those times.

Its so simple. Get a fake aadhar ans a phone number, make an APAAR ID, show the person as an student in the college, then post 3-4 years, change the photo and address with fake verification documents and then sell the degree with the years and records for 10 lacs. This is India, where people are extremely smart in thinking and doing wrong things. No level of oversight can prevent this cause the people only are like this. Parties to this contract: School administration/Agents/Fake degree applicants /Aadhar center agents/Fake documents producers. What can the govt do here. If the primary person verifying the details, schools admin is party to fraud. Not like this wasn't happening before, we have loads lf cases of fake degrees being sold. That was a paper based and local ledger. Same details on APAAR would be computer based and in e-form. Thar is definitely better than carrying hard copies of passing certificate, mark sheets and other documents, for the non-fraudulemt population (majoriry of us like 99%, cause 1% of fraudster is still 1.4 cr people). Aadhar is a Primary key in a database. This APAAR/Pen is a secondary key in the database only for that keys educational detail. Like DL has a DL number, voter ID has a Voter Number, Ration card has a Ration card number. They all are separate areas linked by aadhar Primary key. CBSE and UGC and Govt university also send the same data to the govt but its not that interactive or thatich interlinked. They already know which child is doing what, in which college, with what marks. But this will be found out when they put up a request to fetch data frok different sources. Once you link it up, its just put the aadhar number and you kundli is there. Easier access to data for all parties involved and digitisation of records are the main objective of the exercise. That was the whole idea of aadhar-non financial data, PAN-Financial data. I was forced by my university to enroll in this. I was probably one of the last people to do it. They threatened me in the end if I don't do it. It's there but it's not centralized like PAN. I think it's already there. A few years back they were asking people to link their PAN with Aadhar To track farts ? Doesn't the govt already have all our aadhaar numbers Hmm this is getting more sinister Don't get complicit, fight the bs Kundli? Did you say kundli? I did when i was a young bouy Everything is out there to kill ya slowly Yeah, kundli. Thats a saying, puri kundli mil gaye. Access to all information relating to the person, all the way from birth, linking it with parents which would link up with their parents provided the data is available in e-form, including financial and non financial data. Oh you didn't mean it literally. Yes they want all the data, but why? It's their motives that I don't trust You think they don't already know? Privacy is an illusion Boycott Like brib- A single database allows for informed decision relating of the people of the country. Better statistics as the data is collected first hand in real-time. Better implementation of govt policies as they are based on the data of the recipients. In short Big data analytics. This has lots of uses for governance and planning. The same way it benefits For profits businesses, in providing insights. Like there so many inference that you can take out from IT data relating to 1.5 cr taxpayers. The types of income, the source, the method of collection, the buildup of X type of income in an area. How should policies be set up for taxation. How should states favour their locations where income generation is heavy, so that more income is generated and hence more tax. Like I'd love get the GST data made public as well. Like state wise/district wise/citywise and industry wise. That would show which district is doing good by how much, where all are industry hubs. Which area is doing business with which area, where can we open new industrial areas, which hubs need relocation, which areas can be linked to make a connected hub. What are the general purchase ratios to profits, what are service expense ratio to profits. Cause we know profits from MCA portal, and if we get GST purchase data from GST. It could help people set up new business based on proximity to their vertical companies. This also helps in Identifying fraud, fake invoicing due to abnormal operations wrt to area and industry. Secondly, ease of access to data to the individuals. No need for hard copies. Everything is in e-form. The only downside is Hacking/DDOS attacks. Its not mandatory btw. PS : I feel bad for all the kids in school rn, this must be like what Adhaar was for us, we were forced by the school to get an Adhaar ID like they suspended classes for the day and made every kid go into a queue and give their thumbprints and all for Adhaar. 😂😂😂 Don’t give ideas, Mannn We had ABC, something called Academic Bank of Credit or something, still don't know why or where it was supposed to be useful. Bro tf 😭🙏🏻 I am not feeling safe in today's world . You do whatever you want but you can't protect your data from anyone. I get the use of data, but I don't think that's their purpose tbh Sounds like they were trying to implement a US-style credit system in universities? Bhai tu kuch jyada hi critical ho rha hai, matlab kuch bhi bak rha hai, jab new system aata hai to usme time lagta hai and I think india hates innovation just like you mocking on every comment मैं इस सरकार को trust नहीं करती, मुझे नहीं लगता की वो कुछ भी moral innovative ideas कर सकते है, only immoral ones (translate: I don't trust this govt, I don't think they're capable of any moral innovative ideas, only immoral ones) They can seperate the information into sections, such as Identity, Educational, Financial, etc and enforce seperate update cooldowns for each section. Would be much better for administration and for citizens. never miss a chance to criticize govt initiatives... proud citizen IMO it's actually a good initiative. Stores educational details of people, tightening on fake degrees. If only they take security seriously tho. Reminds me of [this XKCD](https://xkcd.com/927/) At this point, nothing really. There was a time when it was the ID for income tax and financial purposes. Then they made it so you had to connect it to Aadhaar for it to be acceptable anywhere. There was a time it could be used as a PoI, now I see even that is being eroded and its not acceptable as a PoI in many cases. I wouldn't be surprised if they kill PAN entirely within the next 10-15 years. What better data protections? People got admin access to their production database by paying 500 Rs, and the UIDAI's response in court was to talk about the height and width of the walls around their data center. I can guarantee you, every Chinese intelligence officer has an up to date copy of the database on their servers. I often joke that we don't need to keep backups of Aaadhaar because if our DB is ever corrupted, we can always ask the Chinese to give us their copy. > They already know which child is doing what, in which college, with what marks. But this will be found out when they put up a request to fetch data from different sources. That problem has a known solution: a data warehouse/lakehouse. We've enough data engineers in the country that could build a solution to make that happen without needing to issue a whole new ID to every student of the country. Why do you need APAAR for digital versions of passing certificates? You already have that on Digilocker right now. If an Aadhaar-PEN is a 1:1 relation (which it should be as both pertain to the same individual) then you do not need to issue an ID. The student can quote Aadhaar, you lookup the PEN in the database. Which in turn would reveal that the PEN is entirely unnecessary, the primary key of the educational record can be the Aadhaar ID. Your DL and Voter ID examples don't hold, because those systems predate Aadhaar and therefore their databases were not designed with Aadhaar in mind. Aadhaar has been positioned as the overarching ID, so newly designed systems don't need to use their own IDs. > Also, educational details that you will update quite frequently, whereas you cannot update Aaddhar card twice or thrice. This is the classic master data/transactional data distinction. This is done in databases today. Your customer details update far slower than order details too for instance. Single centralized databases are hard to manage, secure etc I agree - but the principle underlying Aadhaar was precisely to implement that kind of centralization. So if that is the principle, why not adhere to it? Why make citizens run around for this ID and that ID when you explicitly created a single ID to cover all use cases? You can check your credit score online by just giving your PAN number, you bet government and financial institutions are using PAN to track your financial activities. They could be - the point is though, I don't see why they couldn't do the same tracking with Aadhaar and get rid of PAN. Every financial instrument you have is likely connected to Aadhaar as well. I can answer that as a data developer, having one big data source is a bad idea. There needs to be multiple small tables instead of one big table. It is known as Separation of Concerns and modularization. From an outside perspective it looks like Aadhar table is the master table and every other stuff(voter, passport, pan, abha, apaar etc) are child tables with link to the Aadhar table From an IT architecture perspective it is a bad idea, absolutely. But that bad idea (centralise everything into one ID) is at the very heart of the Aadhaar design. That has been the criticism of the Aadhaar from day one. However, that criticism was always ignored and the govt said they wanted to centralize. Now we get the worst of both worlds. Every ID has been centralized or linked into a single ID, which makes it easy for the govt and any malicious actor to misuse this data. But the supposed benefit to the citizen (which was that we wouldn't need so many IDs) does not materialize because we continue the proliferation of IDs and the inconvenience to the citizens remains. So I can show my PP as my identification now? ✊✊✊ By centralisation they mean single database which they are doing, but a single database can have multiple tables. That's my educated guess I think the whole idea was that PAN is kinked with all financial items, and aadhar is linked with all non-financial items. But both PAN and aadhar should be linked as PAN database predates the Aadhar one. The other thing is, that PAN/Aadhar will bece the primary key for all database, but each database will have a secondary key as well, like DL license no, Voter Number, APAAR no, CBSE roll no, College admission number etc. The secondary key is for the said institution to navigate the database, but for the individual and govt it will be PAN/Aadhar. Basically master table, with multiple separate databases owned/managed by separate institutions but controlled on a comman platform. aadhar has become a joke at this point. \" APAAR ID is being aggressively implemented without any law or policy written down to back it \" This is exactly why I'm fuming at this policy. My nephew is being punished for failing to provide the documents just 2 days after school reopened. No meeting between parents or anything else. We are simply supposed to provide our documents blindly and sign a \" consent \" form. Which part of this process falls under content i wonder. I literally had this debate with someone right now. Like they already have our data on various platforms and files. Why are we constantly asked for papers and call this bullshit digitization. How many credentials are we supposed to keep in our mind and pockets? It has already been a headache to keep track of shit load of accounts and login details to simplify your life after the debacle of demonetization and COVID. School kids are being punished and insulted for not submitting this on time. I can't really understand their agenda by issuing a deadline if this is such an innovation that will make things easy for students in future. Why can't they keep the process open end instead of forced? It is really so bad with how schools are forcing this. And to write the details in a specific language too. Why such a rush if this is for students benefits? People aren't mad because of the idea. People are because of how this is forcefully shoved down or throat. Most of the students in India are now put under pressure because they are either being punished/insulted or straight up asked not to sit for the exams if documents with the \" CONSENT \" form isn't sent. Something fishy. I feel like the little disclaimers/ terms & conditions on the newly collected data is different from the older data (incl Aadhar). Maybe the older data made it harder for the govt to share/ sell..? I don't know, speculating, but like I said, I don't trust the government As per the judgement dated 26-Sep-2018, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, ONLY the CBDT (Central Board of Direct Taxes / Income Tax Department) can demand Aadhaar card from the tax payer. NO OTHER ENTITY, govt. or private, can demand Aadhaar as mandatory. If any entity other than the Income Tax Dept demands Aadhaar, submit your PASSPORT as DOB proof, Photo ID proof, Address proof. VOTER ID (for 18+ years) also can be furnished as proof of DOB, Photo ID and Address Proof If they don't accept it, share the link to the below judgement, dated 26-Sep-2018, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India And tell that entity to give in writing that they will not accept PASSPORT as valid proof of DOB, Address, Photo ID. They will back off. As a recent example: I renewed the passport of a family member last month. On the passport renewal form, In the Aadhaar field, it is marked as OPTIONAL.
