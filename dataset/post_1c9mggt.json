The agent assured me that if I opted for a more expensive recharge, the router would be provided free of cost. This enticing offer seemed like a win-win situation, and I eagerly signed up. Little did I know that this seemingly straightforward transaction would evolve into a frustrating ordeal.\n\n\n\nüìû Relentless Calls: Initially, everything went smoothly. I diligently recharged my account each month, as instructed. However, Hathway‚Äôs approach to customer service took an unexpected turn. Before the recharge expiry date, my phone started buzzing incessantly. Hathway representatives bombarded me with calls‚Äîsometimes more than five times a day‚Äîfrom different numbers. Their sole purpose? To remind me to recharge. Despite my repeated requests to be added to the Do Not Disturb (DND) list, the calls persisted. It felt like an unending game of cat and mouse.\n\n\n\nüè† Moving Out: Fast forward to February 2024. I was relocating to a different city, and it was time to bid adieu to Hathway. I requested disconnection, assuming that my router‚Äîpromised as ‚Äúfree‚Äù‚Äîcould be left behind. After all, I had limited space in my moving boxes. I entrusted the router to my neighbor, who was temporarily away. Little did I know that this decision would come back to haunt me.\n\n\n\nüì± Persistent Calls Redux: Hathway‚Äôs relentless pursuit continued. Their team, undeterred by weekends or common courtesy, called me repeatedly. Their demand? Recharge, recharge, recharge! I felt trapped in a loop. I raised the issue multiple times via email, hoping for resolution. But alas, their responses remained frustratingly inadequate.\n\n\n\nüîó DND Violation: Here‚Äôs the kicker: Hathway insisted that the router was their property. Until I returned it, the calls wouldn‚Äôt cease. But wait‚Äîthese calls weren‚Äôt about router collection; they were relentless reminders to recharge. This blatant violation of DND regulations left me exasperated.\n\n\n\nüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Avoid Hathway: My advice to fellow netizens: If you value your sanity, steer clear of Hathway. Their inability to honor DND requests is mind-boggling. Perhaps they lack the mechanism to implement it effectively.\n\n\n\nüìß Email Exchange: The email chain grew longer‚Äî20+ replies from both sides. Hathway‚Äôs stance remained unchanged: Calls would persist until my account was terminated. Meanwhile, my neighbor‚Äôs absence prolonged the router‚Äôs return.\n\n\n\nü§î My Conclusion: I now wonder if Hathway‚Äôs DND button is a mere decoration. Their insistence on router retrieval contradicts their initial promise. As I bid farewell to Hathway, I hope others learn from my experience.",

        "This happened with me with Tikona. They were calling via fake lawyers and emailing us for the router though they said initially that it‚Äôs free and we can keep it. So when I was relocating next time, I had Hathaway connection. I forced them to send a technician to collect the router and give me a receipt of the collection. I had to run after them a lot for this but got it done. So no calls and all after that!",
        "Report the DND calls to your telco through the telco's app. That got them to stop for me. Once a few of their phone numbers are on the hook for violating DND regulations, it'll be in their interest to stop bothering you.\n\nHow I know this: I did it, and it worked. Plus, when you do a DND complaint, the offending party gets your number, so they know to back off from you in particular.",

        "Yaa, we were college kids back then so got scared and paid the charges they were asking for. But now we know better!",
