    "selftext": " \n\nSTATEMENT: The Telecommunication Bill, 2023 makes significant departures from its 2022 counterpart. Our concerns? Some same old, glaring. Some new, & quite concerning. We're unsure about the roots of these changes, \\*drumroll\\* since DOT never published the consultation comments. \n\nThe definition of ‚Äòtelecom service‚Äù in the 2023 Bill is much shorter & doesn't mention the entities to whom the Act will apply to. The current ambiguous definitions do not make it explicitly clear that internet services (messaging, email, etc.) do not come under its ambit. 2/11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jxerm8x9577c1.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8bb75fc9e7ce2e6cbf33a55b80539969cecde70\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ng86hi9b577c1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=46cdab4001ba2e5153c73ea1ac13c1a442b5008b\n\nThe 2022 Bill allowed the Union govt to issue licences for providing telecom services. The 2023 Bill has repackaged & introduced a similar concept of ‚Äúauthorisation‚Äù, allowing the Union govt to retain same powers, thus not addressing concerns around centralisation of power. 3/11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyw8angd577c1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=55b10cf12d47c9d1941c47482010ed651b9305fb\n\nThe 2023 Bill exacerbates privacy invading provisions such as the obligation of any authorised entity, as notified by the Union govt, to identify the person to whom it provides telecom services, through use of any verifiable biometric based identification ‚Äúas may be prescribed‚Äù. 4/11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74tcd4uf577c1.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b943085b845ec5d171fa0eb5022ee225e215d97\n\nThe 2022 Bill did not reference biometric identification. This, coupled with the uncertainty brought by the phrase ‚Äúas may be prescribed‚Äù, and ambit of the bill, threatens to a user‚Äôs ability to stay anonymous online. 5/11\n\nThe DoT has carried forward the duty imposed on users to not furnish any false information while establishing their identity for availing ‚Äòtelecommunication services‚Äô. This provision, if applicable to internet services, will have serious implications for anonymity online. 6/11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8lhl4rh577c1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfdc6af7e28ae574680c576ae702cd1e03fbb7e7\n\n**T7**\n\nThe Bill misses an opportunity to reform draconian telecom suspension & surveillance powers ‚Äì leaving the duration & manner of shutdowns and interception to delegated legislation without an anchoring criteria. 7/11\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgpt43pl577c1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=bad58fcf208872d25eae047e9c3c8c4b42ba844b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eldsivpm577c1.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b230ba9c86b3ee21475fb86b8e218674d04ad02\n\nIt suffers from excessive delegation by according the Union govt overbroad rule-making powers (a familiar pattern by now), incl. powers to exempt entities & uses, w/o adequate safeguards. At 46 instances, the Bill is left open to details that ‚Äúmay be prescribed‚Äù/‚Äúnotified‚Äù. 8/11\n\nMoreover, the Bill confers quasi-judicial powers to ‚Äúauthorised officers‚Äù appointed by the Union govt, incl. powers of search and seizure of unauthorised telecom equipment, and power to summon information, documents, & records pertaining to legal proceedings under the Bill. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tho3uiqo577c1.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d814ca5eedde1ec059b24960dddab9df839f17\n\nFinally, the penalty imposed on users for using ‚Äòtelecommunication services‚Äô that they believe do not have authorisation under the Bill, has been increased from INR 1 Lakh to 10 Lakh. The hefty penal provision remains vague & arbitrary as its 2022 counterpart, but now with a 10x fine. 10/11 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptrx75ts577c1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=343842a35dd8e3e2735d1f1627631486251a3e0d\n\nWe stand against the introduction of the 2023 Telecom Bill in the Parliament which continues the pattern of excessive centralisation & control with the Executive. We‚Äôve said it before, we‚Äôll say it again, this bill needs to go. And be replaced with a rights-centric version. 11/11\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the release of the Broadcasting Bill, 2023, now the draft Telecom Bill, 2023 and the rumoured upcoming DPDPA Rules, the fight for our digital rights is at a critical juncture.   üì∑üì∑  We need YOUR support now more than ever.  \n\n üîªüîªüîªüîªThere is a massive gap of over INR 23,00,000 in our income and expenditure between Jan 2023 to Nov 2023.
