And frankly I am glad that I did.\n\nEdit: Agree that they should've called it of after the Trinity Killer. Everything was downhill from there. BTW, a lot of shows would have ended up classics if they kept it short and didn't linger even after they ran out of ideas.",

        "If you liked Barry, you might like Mr Inbetween.",
        "Thanks for the elaborate comment. Will definitely check them out.\n\nI also had The Morning Show in mind. I am a sucker for anything having a sports background so Ted Lasso was just the right thing.",

I would ideally want a smart TV but the reviews on Amazon worry me. They often run into issues mainly software related. Hence, need your help. Budget is below 20K and 32inch is fine.

But, there's no wifi and I am not sure if my mom knows how to run a hotspot. I can teach her that though\n\nAlso, is extended warranty worth it?",
        "Instead of a smart TV, consider Fire TV stick. You would need to teach her how to use it, but it's fairly simple and it won't run into software issues. Also cheaper.",
        "if you are looking for a smart tv or wish to add smart features, I suggest buy a Fire TV edition TV which basically means that the TV's OS is Fire OS (same on in firestick). This way you don't have to separately buy fire stick and FireOS based TVs work well too. I have 2 of them. One from Onida brand and one from amazonbasics brand.\n\nJust so you know, 32 Inch mostly will come as 720p. Even if you get 1080p, it may be relatively more expensive.",
