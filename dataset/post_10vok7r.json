I was just eating at an Indian restaurant in America and was transfixed by a music video that was playing on MTV India -- but I couldn't tell who the singer was or the song that was playing. \n\nThe show said it was a \"trendsetter\" so I'm guessing it was a newer video. It was a female singer. There were lots of quick cuts, it felt like a movie, and didn't really ever show her singing, but with some dancing. Some of the moments I remember were three men holding guns and then opening a door to hundreds of men holding knives, and the men with guns getting scared. Later, there was a leader of a city and everyone was wearing paper masks of that leader's face. \n\nIf anyone has any idea what this was, I'd love to watch it again! Thank you so much!",
