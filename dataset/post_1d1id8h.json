        "Dude. Polling Officer duty is like the worst job ever but you have to do it regardless of circumstances. My Mother has been doing the polling duty since her 25 years and only in this election she was kept as \"reserve\".\n\nTo put it into perspective, First they give you order which comes like 1 month ahead of elections and couple of months before they have to attend training at a certain college or a govt office(Bigger ones to accommodate 100s of people)And they provide food which sucks while everyone attending is in very good post in their profession(In no way people would eat that shit they provide but hard to cook at home and bring it). In case you're wondering the training office is going to be relatively far away for most of the attendees it is mostly 2-3hours of travel. That is going to be whole day affair 9am-5pm they give out books regarding rules etc.,\n\nNow to the EVM/ballot distribution centers, If you thought Training circumstances are bad this is going to be worse. Most of the time EVM centres(we don't use ballot anymore so) are going to be far away from city due to the number of people it needs around thousands from polling officers to police/security hence the remote location. For which State provides buses which are ordinary kind with bad suspensions. If you ask why that's a problem, It is because from the EVM distribution the polling stations are going to be further away. could be 10kms-100kms sometimes even more(If I now have to explain road conditions to these places, idk man). Then you've got to stay whatever the station is for 2 days 1 for setting up the station which local office person will clean it but everything else A Polling officer, Assistant PO, 3 others and a security guard or couple of them should set up. You absolutely have to sleep in that office. And food should be provided by the office staff or local people can do it. The offices might have a washroom or they might not. Then next whole day you got for polling/voting whatever you may call it.\n\nThe election day. Your job is absolutely on the line especially for PO and APO (Assistant (Polling Officer)) And could also be jailed. Then we get dumbasses like Madhavi Latha(Google her somehow I can't link the videos if I did reddit is removing the comment) If a candidate is checking or showing authority over Polling station everyone's job is at risk. And the particular area polling would be deemed mismanaged and can't be counted. You can't go eat lunch during polling day.\n\nMoving on to after election, They're put on same bus to return carrying the EVM boxes.. Here the greater bullshit risk starts buses will drop near EVM collection centres most of the time same place where they distributed the EVMs from. PO and APO are in charge of those boxes and the other members and security leave most of the time because the amount given is something around 1k-1.5k for polling officers. much lesser for underlings. So now because they leave My father used to help mom carrying ballot boxes, during 2019 I had to do it. Anyway buses park wherever they find space meaning you have to walk to the station carrying the machines could be somewhere from 100m to a kilometer. I could do it but not most of the polling officers who are around 45-55. Then at EVM collection they drag their feet and could sometimes take time till morning next day after voting day.\n\nTL:DR :- Bhai chod de ye ek do line mein nahi explain nahi hothi.",

He was always critical about the facilities provided by the ECI. For example most of the polling booths are set up in schools, and govt Schools especially in rural areas lacked even basic facilities like clean bathrooms or a rest room. Even today!

He had to walk 5-6 kms to get to the polling booth in some very remote village in the Bardhaman district, with no proper water supply,  almost no sanitation, sometimes not even proper food for the night or fans. He gave up doing this job 3 years ago.\n\nThe previous year, the booth where my elder brother was the presiding officer, got attacked by some local goons with guns and knives in their hands. They took the voting machines and went away, and locked my elder brother and 5 other booth workers in a dark room with no windows and fans, no food and water. My elder brother called the police, but the police said that they won't be able to lodge a complaint as the goons have made a settlement with them.

        "My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. \nOne time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. \nHe was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. \nSome people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing.  \nYou forgot to paint the finger for a voter? Jailed.\nYou were late for reporting to duty? Jailed.\nYou couldn't come to duty as you were hospitalized? Yeah Jailed. \nEC takes action first, evaluate later",

Dihadi mazdoor bhi din mein kamse kam 500 kamata hai It's an inhumane job, and they've chartered an inhumane job profile for it. The entire process feels like 'Jugaad' from the Indian govt, as if 'Vote ho jaaye bas'. The polling booths are utterly pathetic, and the amenities are even worse. The entire process is set up in such a way that people taking part in it are conditioned to treat it as normal. You have to go sleep-deprived, food-deprived, peace-deprived, and just count the hours until this whole circus is over. I've ranted so much, and I still feel like it's not enough. Pathetic! Correct Even schools in Bangalore don't have proper functioning toilets, taps are broken, no water, too much stench and rats. Was there reelection ? Tujhe jyada problem hai chor de bahan, Merit mai bahut log hai Hmm Arey to bohot or kya sarkari naukri hai to kaam to hai nhi kuch marne do haramio ko My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. One time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. He was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. Some people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing. You forgot to paint the finger for a voter? Jailed. You were late for reporting to duty? Jailed. You couldn't come to duty as you were hospitalized? Yeah Jailed. EC takes action first, evaluate later Yes I'm aware that high ranking officials are treated well during election duties But polling and presiding officers are not,as already described in my post Yeah. That's what I am trying to say. It might look like High ranking officials are treated well but everyone in election duty is miserable. True But higher ranking officials at least don't have to slog in extreme heat during the summer elections they get AC rooms You are not wrong about that. It's better to cry sitting in a BMW than in a Bus. Yes true Thanks for understanding"
