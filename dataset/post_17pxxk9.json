That is just jingoism, SC has clear guidelines on percentage of reservation cannot be greater than 50%. Only TN got away with this rule because it came before the judgement otherwise all states have failed. The latest example is the Maratha reservation. Why not make it 100% lol. Fucking retards What's with this odd number. Just do 100% and be done with it. 😭 (This should be universal emoji to represent generals in india) At this rate just remove the reservation Ok. So what No there are loophole and this slippery slop [https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/arguments-in-ews-verdict-may-serve-as-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-seeking-more-quota-post-bihar-caste-survey/article67376521.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/arguments-in-ews-verdict-may-serve-as-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-seeking-more-quota-post-bihar-caste-survey/article67376521.ece) Maybe they are taking inspiration from Tamil Nadu where reservation has reached 70%. Apparently only 3 recipes work in Indian politics: 1. Reservation politics 2. Freebie politics 3. Religious polarisation politics Every party picks one of these 3 This !! Going with the way that helps in getting votes without actually helping the people. The survey shows that only 5-6% of SC people actually complete Class 11/12. Maybe work to improve that number also so that they can use the reservation benefits. The blame goes to BJP for breaking the 50% ceiling by introducing EWS. bhai headline skip krke comment kia hai kya,\"so what\" mtlb kya lmao Pura kar de Bhai. 13% discount kyu de Raha haye ? Point 3 can be broadened for ethnic, linguistic polarization as well. But yeah what you said really encompasses everything in Indian politics Just Make it to 100% lol, I'll just swim in Unemployment. Very less, that should make it 100% atleast This country is not for general category They will keep voting for them I want them to make it 100% so government universities lose their prestige and the country can move on to private universities instead to source talent. Reservation affects more than just universities. Our bureaucratic class is made up of this. Entire vote bank politics changes as a result. Reddit being young just focuses on colleges 13% Kyun chod diya. Full and final Kar do ab. Make it 200% atleast, that is 100% in all future positions, and 100% of jobs or positions or that generals currently posess should be transferred to reserved categories. Hehe, dumb retards, what will happen with 87%, 200% is like at least, u can also increase it to 300% by seizing all assets, properties, businesses, and women of general category for the reserved ones, and generals should become homeless beggars. One article said 65, one said 75, here it says 87. What did he actually say!! Or all 3 yes return to the aryan steppes they must, wherever that is? for those of you unaware, this is what MAJORITARIANISM looks like But with AIT more or less being doubted wisely, the steppes, unfortunately, be here. No country for OC men Why not 99%? I bet us general category folks will still vote for the same politicians. They are going to deny the seats to actual needy and sell these seats behind. Its not increase in seats its increasing their own side income. Sab vote ke liye bas. Development lode pe Nah EWS Reservation breached the 50 mark. SC allowed it You don't add other reservations to this. They are vertical and horizontal reservations. Making it 100 percent would remove the debate. Keep on increasing it by 5 - 6 percent with different categories so that it can easily stretch for 5 decades. IIRC There is no legal basis for restriction to 50%. Once national caste survey returns results that are consistent with Bihar survey results i.e. backward castes make up more than 50% of the population, SC will have no leg to stand on. MAJORITARIANISM already happened in 2019, we are playing around with different versions of it from now on. EWS already breached the 50 percent rule. RIP India. The West is moving away from quota politics on the basis of genetics (e.g. affirmative action struck down) but in India politicians are only doubling down. Give them 100% and they’ll still complain about how it is not enough Is it possible to kick a state out of india until they get their shit together? And this is exactly why Congress and its allies won't get my vote You can get my vote if you make it 200% Make it 100%, Then bring it to Private sector. Oh...there isn't any private sector in Bihar oops 😬 EWS is outside if caste based reservation Dude it still affects the 50 percent limit. Merit candidates would take a back seat just because they may be middle class. It's still not fair. We cannot adopt the western models unless they fit into our socioeconomic goals. Our social and economic composition is significantly diverse, different and vast compared to West. On the basis of merit, not genetics. Well said. EWS limit is 8 lakhs/annum most middle class falls into. There are other rules as well like residential property less than 1000 sq feet/agricultural land 5 acres, etc. If I remember well even I was in the same class till 5 years ago however, there were no major financial troubles as we lived within our limits. [ removed ] Wtf happened here >EWS limit is 8 lakhs/annum most middle class falls into. There are other rules as well like residential property less than 1000 sq feet/agricultural land 5 acres, etc. It's not just educational institutions but government jobs as well. Should I stop getting a chance to crack central government jobs just because my dad is rich ? Why is it that Bihar is the place which evolves backwards? I am wondering how much of a loss rest of India is having such a state that sucks all the funds and have stupid policies all around From 70 working hours to 87% reservation. India moving backward, glorious ancient Virat history If i am correct, SC barred the reservation to at Max 50%. Controversial opinion, but I don’t believe in equal voting rights. Equal voting rights makes the politicians use the above to sway voters. The “freebie” classes shouldn’t be allowed to vote for people who need to make long-term policy decisions. We can have a separate freebie budget (like a bribe paid to the dumb masses to keep them quiet), and the dumb masses can vote for people who decide how to spend the freebie budget. These freebie representative should not be given any role in framing policy. Their job is to work with the freebie budget only. Not sure what are you trying to say Reservation is good but not when it takes away the rights of others who are deserving and capable. Not when it’s used for the wrong reasons. You are going to leave behind a state that is brain drained and all that will remain is a cesspool of dumbfucks. All the best tch tch, ilk of your kind manages to hyphenate everything with one party Stating the facts makes me ilk of my kind ? Definition: \"Majoritarianism is a political philosophy or ideology with the agenda asserting that a majority based on a religion, language, social class, or other category of the population, is entitled to a certain degree of primacy in society, and has the right to make decisions that affect the society.\" Are you saying that NDA is not forcing majority religions dogmatism down everyone's throats ? By the way, I am not afraid to call out any political party that does something wrong, I am not partisan at all. \\> government jobs as well \\> Also 8 Lakhs is nothing If you think 8 lacs is nothing, why would you be interested in government jobs in the first place? >If someone thinks 8 lacs is nothing, why would they be interested in government jobs in the first place? If you think an IAS/IFS officer only earns 8Lakhs/Year, I don't know what to tell you. >Even class I jobs pay like 70k a month to start with minimal increments throughout your life. People take government jobs for stability. At the end of the day, my parents salary should not be the deciding factor for me to get or not get the job. Not a difficult concept to grasp. An IAS/IPS officer indeed just makes 8 lakhs a year. I know a bunch of honest ones. Rest who take bribes are just scums. What stability when someone in corporate with that skill makes 10-20x you and can make your entire life savings in what, 2 years >What stability when someone in corporate with that skill makes 10-20x you and can make your entire life savings in what, 2 years Lol, just because there was a bubble once doesn't guarantee it will last in UT Again choice is the right word here. Saying I should not be discriminated against is key here. There’s no bubble. And it’s not just IT lol. HFTs pay even more How about reservations in their own political parties ? And pass a law that mandated politicians and their families can get medical treatment only from government hospitals and doctors who passed based on quotas. every time i see this post, the percentage increases. wtf? Why not make it 100%? The sign of excess subhuman population in a country Private sector in Bihar is organized scams, thefts and frauds. Now don't allow reserved catagory person/candidate to apply from open. Open should be strictly for open category candidate. UPSC is already such a lottery that most competent people who have other options don’t play that game. > Not sure what are you trying to say Not sure what are you trying to say I am asking what his point was since I dont use Hindi so much. which is what makes it a bypass/loophole. Typical misogynist objectifying women as properties to be had. The only excess I see is 1.48% seeing Bihar's new census shows only 15.52% are general caste, while that 15.52% holds over 80% of posts [Narrow Concept Of 'Merit' Allows Upper Caste Individuals To Mask Their Obvious Caste Privilege : Justice Chandrachud](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/justice-dy-chandrachud-caste-privilege-caste-discrimination-dr-ambedkar-187082) >B.P. Mandal, the chairman of the Mandal Commission, made several notable statements about merit and privilege. One of his most famous quotes is: >\"Merit is not a monopoly of any particular class or caste. Merit can be found in every section of society, provided Equal opportunities are given to all.\" >The quote highlights Mandal's belief that **merit is not an inherent quality of an individual, but rather a product of the opportunities and privilege they have access to**. He argued that if all individuals were given equal opportunities, then merit would be more evenly distributed across society. Nope. I once had a SC guy tell me that we should get our daughters married to SC to prove that we are not casteist. That guy was educated and now works at Google as an SDE. OC women are already objectified. They are \"Game Prize\". OP Comment is just telling the fact. Yay, you are so brave 👏 And SC/ST get reservation for life even if someone from their community becomes an ias officer...his kid will also get reservation. This is wrong atleast obc mai creamy and NCL to hai > According to the survey report, OBCs, including the extremely backward classes sub-group, accounted for a whopping 63 per cent of the state's total population, while SCs and STs together were slightly over 21 per cent. As per survey general category is only 15%, why would you swim in unemployment? Couldn't find it in the featured article. Except the following. > The report said more than a third of families in Bihar are live on a monthly income of Rs 6,000 or less, while the percentage of SC-ST families living on similar income is nearly 43 per cent. Open category population is 5%, and still 30% is unreserved. Plus Open Category people in TN are the richest among their counterparts in most other states. Even SCs in TN are more richer than UCs of Bihar. Actually the UCs of Bihar need reservation then. Meritocracy is the only solution. This is not just one SC guy, I have seen this argument by whole SC communities on internet that upper caste should give up their women and marry them off to lower castes like an object. 65 is for SC/ST, OBC and other underprivileged groups iirc. Whereas 10% for UC. Misleading title, correct caption Overall, a disaster Just shows the how retarded reservation supporters are. You are conflating \"upper\" caste population with open category/unreserved. No wonder you support reservation if you don't understand that SC/ST/OBC can still fight for open seats. You can find that [here](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bihar-caste-survey-over-42-sc-st-families-poor-says-bihar-caste-survey-4553342) There is a lot of data and it will take quite some time for reports to come out. If you can read Hindi, [this](https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/state/bihar/patna/bihar-caste-survey-social-economic-data-released-brahman-bhumihar-kayastha-rajput-syed-latest-update/articleshow/105036019.cms?story=6) has the most data I could find. Can you fucking create more universities instead? Technically the truth One day reservation will become 100%. Then they will ask for already employed generals to be suspended and their positions filled by reserved. And ironically, the politicians will promise that too. Iske papa ko side me karke nikal lena chahiye tha You deserve it since your ancestor called my ancestor a bad boy. /s >No wonder you support reservation if you don't understand that SC/ST/OBC can still fight for open category seats Don't they have to choose their category while applying for the exam? Its like saying atheism is also a religion since they don't believe in any religion. 15% of seats reserved for SC means it is the MINIMUM % of SC that needs to be represented. So during counselling sc students can get their names on both sc and ur lists? An SC students name can EITHER be on SC list or in Unreserved list, but not both. Some people really think only MAXIMUM 15% seats can be given to SC people. I see anger here but I don't see any counter arguments here. Why are people mad? I am so glad that I am leaving India in two months and hopefully never ever come back here. The hell this will defeat the purpose of reservation and make the majority angry agianst it I mean even till 84% I could understand. A general merit person would then be competing as if there is equality in opportunities (bihar has around 15.5% general population). Open category means the seat is open for everyone, either reserved or undeserved. The reservation limit is the minimum % of those certificate holders That 16% is open category any caste could take it they only need to score good r/oddlyspecific I mean it’s entirely taken by general candidates. Just thinking logically, why would someone who can get a better seat using reservation take a general seat? >Just thinking logically, why would someone who can get a better seat using reservation take a general seat? Because when you get a higher score you take the open category regardless of your caste. The reservation is basically a backup pplan for st/sc people I'm glad to not live in this shithole state which was made by these illiterate scum bag politicians. sad for bihari peeps but then again you voted for clowns. Caste System is a meme (original meaning) manifested into reality (leading to Blood Lineage outcomes that then sustained itself). It survived competition with other powerful memes. It even survived competition with other Religious meme and subjugated them (Sikh or Christian Dalits is a thing). To think that Reservation is going to eradicate Caste is naivety of the highest order. And if the claim then becomes Reservation wasn't about eradicating Caste (which would be accurate claim since it was about Socio Political-Economic Representation as primary function) then the exercise itself becomes a joke. You can't eradicate this by stuff like this. It is going going to prop it up even more. India will become Swiss level rich and Caste System will still exist if we go on like this. Only solution is Inter-Caste unions at population scale level. Most are fine with it happening over 200-300 years, other few want it to happen in 50-60 years. Umm, so you are saying ki of you get NIT trichy and IIT Bombay you’ll take trichy? I’m not defending reservation, just the fact that after so many years of it cut offs remain so wildly different is a red flag. But I’m just saying that an equal society with no caste discrimination would be equivalent to having 15% general merit seats. The difference in cut offs just is a reflection of obvious caste based inequality in the society, which reservation hasn’t fixed. But let’s not act like the general merit student is the main victim. I don't think you understand how the reservation system works lol Help me understand? Then are you of the opinion that if 83% reservation is formally introduced in bihar then 17% formal reservation should also be introduced for general? There is no “ur” list You apply only for sc list If your marks and preferences match according to UR cutoff (which it seldom does) you’ll be automatically given a UR seat so that the sc seat can be given to someone else Got it. And I don't apply for sc list lol. I am the same as you, an unfortunate general male. Yeah I did not mean you as in specifically you lol > Only 25.09 per cent of General Category families are listed as poor. Within this, 25.32 per cent of Bhumihars, 25.3 per cent of Brahmins, and 24.89 per cent of Rajputs are listed as poor. Brahmins and Rajputs account for 7.11 per cent of Bihar's population. The Bhumihars are 2.86 per cent. If I understand correctly 7.11 + 2.86 = 9.97 are upper castes are poor and there is 10% reservation for EWS in general category. So 100% of them are covered under reservation. And yet they oppose reservations for marginalized and poor? Thanks for the links. In a way you are asking 16% reservation for general yeah sure riots will erupt even at the mention of such a thing There should be no reservation at all. Not for women, EWS, SC, ST, OBC, nothing."
