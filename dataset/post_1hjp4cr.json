    "selftext": "Recently, there has been a growing trend of elite individuals expressing their difficulties in living and doing business in this country. While I can empathize with their frustrations, as I, too, have experienced the challenges of bureaucracy and indifference, the situation is beginning to reach an unacceptable level.\n\n**Taxes:** First and foremost, it is essential that you pay your fair share. You reside in a nation where 90% of households earn less than Rs. 25,000 per month (source: [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/people-earning-rs-25000-per-month-fall-in-top-10-of-wage-earners-in-india-report/articleshow/91694940.cms)). So, itâ€™s time to set aside the libertarian ideals and face reality. The need for welfare programs is critical to address the longstanding effects of misrule. Many of us were not born into privileged circumstances that allowed us to take advantage of societyâ€™s resources. Recognize that not everyone is as fortunate.\n\n**Regional Identity:** Just because you may not speak a native language does not mean the rest of us don't. Not everyone has had their native identity stripped away in favor of Hindi, or worse, English. You are coming to my state and onto my land. Therefore, itâ€™s essential that you respect and learn the local language, or reconsider your presence here.\n\n**Business:** To the NRIs and entrepreneurs, let's be candid. Your return to India is not motivated by patriotism or altruism. You are here because it makes financial sense, whether due to cheaper resources or misguided promises. You are not performing a favor by setting up businesses here, and you should not expect us to revere you for it. Your primary goal is profit, not national service.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy once said, \"Ask not what your country can do for you â€“ ask what you can do for your country.\" Why is it that those of you who spent years abroad have yet to understand this fundamental idea?\n\nThis concludes my thoughts.",

        ">\"Ask not what your country can do for you â€“ ask what you can do for your country.\"\n\nI'd modify this as: ask not what your people can do for you, but what you can do for your people. \"Country\" is an abstraction. People are the more tangible reality.\n\nIndia is just a collection of minds and functions according to our collective mindset. By engaging our peers in a dialog, we can evangelize those values that will make us strong and prosperous. We can change our mindset.\n\nIn particular, it is my belief that India needs to achieve a high level of sophistication in science and technology at every level of the society in order to progress. When we combine this technical competence and rationality with a truly humanistic view of our society, nobody will be able to stop us.\n\nWe do *not* have to give up our religious practices for this. Religion is a matter of the spirit. But we can function with a high degree of technical competence in the world even as we are religious. Plenty of people have done and continue to do so.",

        "Interestingly, the countries young Indians aspire to move toâ€”like the U.S.â€”once faced similar challenges. The United States became rich through hard work, leveraging its natural resources, embracing innovation, and creating robust institutions over centuries. It took nation-building, strategic industrialization, and sacrifices to achieve its developed status. India's youth, while understandably frustrated with systemic issues, hold the key to its future. If they channel their energy and skills domestically, India has the potential to replicate the success of these now-developed nations.\n\nAn analogy I can think of is People just want to skip the building part and just want to live in the building...I understand the sentiment it's just easier to move into an already constructed building than to build one yourself with blood sweat and tears before you can rest in it",
