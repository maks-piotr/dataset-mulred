By your logic, there won't ever be a question with the assertion being incorrect.\n\nEvery statement that is made emphatically is an assertion. These types of questions will always have an assertion as the first statement.\n\nThe question is if the statements are true, and if the second statement is the reason for the first.\n\nThe concept is more easy to understand if the question asked is scientific (based on factual truth). Here's an example I took from a website:\n\nAssertion (A): Seeds should be treated with a fungicide solution.\n\nReason(R):¬†Seeds do not germinate, unless treated with a fungicide solution.\n\nSolution:\n\nFirst we will check if the assertion is true or not.\n\nIn this case the assertion is true.\n\nNow we will check if the reason is true or false.\n\nIn this case the reason is false, as Seeds are treated with fungicide before sowing to avoid seed borne disease.

        "I think it's like [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea) scheme called conscription, where every citizen of South Korea must fulfill a mandatory military training and service( some exceptions are there) .This is because South Korea has a small population, and need a trained army for North Korea. And since they have a small population, it's very easy to feed and provide for their citizens, which is not possible in India, since we have a 1+ billion population to provide.\n\nAlthough this scheme may be seem forceful, there are some benefits, especially **self defense**. During the [1992 Los Angeles Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots) in USA, Black Americans rioted and tried to loot shops, but Korean Americans were able to fend off and defend themselves thanks to South Korea mandatory military training.\n\nSo although I don't think military training is compulsory, I believe that self defense training should be implemented, to teach people to protect themselves from attacks and criminals, remember the Sakshi murder in Delhi? She would have had a chance to protect herself if she knew some self defense\n\nAnd I also think that border states should have some kind of military training, like [Arunachal Pradesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeFMThuVF98), incase there is an invasion from our enemies",

Treating Assertion as opinion(may or may not be true) and reason as known fact(which may or may not justify the said assertion), for this specific question, option one suggests the only way to protect a country is military service, which is still an open statement that different people can interpret differently. Had the R statement been \"Every citizen must protect country against outside threats\", statement 1 would have been correct beyond doubt. Given the question I felt answer should be option 4. Only reason I explain my reasoning is because you seem to have more practice with this so I wanted a deeper perspective from you.",

Now of course there can be counter arguments, but my argument is valid. \n\nSo that makes reason correct and it explains the assertion.\n\nNow coming to is assertion correct.

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "The official correct answer is (1)!!!! What's the point of such a question in Computer Science paper! And who decided what's correct??",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "In a CS paper?? What lmao Wtf? This question doesn't make any sense, i guess it's from the english comprehension part of the exam but in order to say a statement is correct it is needed to be factually correct, the assertion is straight up an opinion It's just evolving backwards Students in China who appear for Gaokao have to write an essay praising the party's policies. This doesn't seem much different except cloaked in the guise of bullshit reasoning. Wait but. I thought that A is an opinion. How do you deem whether it is correct or not? Lmao, are they gonna train 1.4B people? Good luck. I think 4 is the most logical. It is from part B - Subject Specific Knowledge Subjects included ‚Äî Thinking and Decision Making, Mathematics and Computer Awareness So, probably added for 'Thinking and Decision Making'. But question setter themselves don't know what's the difference between decisions and opinions. Exactly, that's why I expected 4 to be correct one. Yeah, 100% unrelated. But the question is invalid for any subject/paper. yeah no way india will have conscription, we already boast a large enough military and military doctrine is slowly shifting towards automation and drone warfare Yeah same, but final answer key say 1!! First is an opinion, so not a fact. 2nd one is also technically an opinion, but most people will accept that, so can be considered. Definitely someone sitting free in NTA was told to make the questions, as for sure he don't know basics about what's the difference between facts and opinion. Then, don't know anything about technicalities of war, economic, feasibility, etc. Just some mindless nationalist. I think they straight out copied the question from an American or a Korean paper and forgot to make edits Military service should be made compulsory and every citizen should protect his country both assuming both are correct. 1 States that if military service is made compulsory every citizen will protect the country. 2. If military service is made compulsory every citizen might or might not protect the country. 2 makes more sense to me. Even if enlisted there might be deserters, it's not going to smooth sailing with the military discipline, that's why I like India doesn't give much and also doesn't take much. The person who set this maybe chose 1 they were thinking that enforcing listing will automatically make every citizen need to protect his country. 4 is Every citizen will protect his country. Even if they don't want to serve in military. No, it isn't. Such questions are quite common in decision making/logical thinking skills. You disagreeing with premise of the question is a separate issue Devolving 4 is the correct one The options talk about A being correct or incorrect. That's why it would be wrong, because there is no definite answer. If the question was just about whether B is correct reason for A (where whether A is correct or incorrect is not part of the question), then it would have made it a thinking skills question. Correct answer for that case will also be debatable, as military service is not the only way to protect a country, there diplomatic ways, digital warfare is rising and so on. Thats not how it happens Everyone serves in their prime u know i felt like its an absolutely norm question, but them i read the part where its a computer science question lmfao. also the options r weird The options have two parts, one is whether A (and B) is correct or not. Which don't have definite answer. Second part (in options 1st and 2nd) is whether B is sufficient reason for A. Which would also be debatable. Not a question for MCQ. 3 Yes yes true. I was just thinking there will be certainly a time limit, for one question to reason it takes so much time, hard to finish the test altogether. The gaokao is a messed up system like no other Obviously the answer should be 2, now it is not about making military mandatory; but if you just keep this Assertion and Reason in point, the I don't think that joining military is only way to keep a country safe. A doctor discovers cure to an ailment which was found in time saving millions of life, is the doctor not a saviour of the country. PS: Much Respect to military I am not downplaying them, I am ar To be honest. I wouldn't want a bunch of untrained citizens protecting my country. Still they need training even if they are in their prime. Han, i meant not the whole population is in their prime at a given point so only a part of it needs training at a given time LMAO Protection doesn't mean only in its physical sense. Working for your country's interest is it's protection. Even paying taxes is protecting your country. Oh ok i get your point. Peace out ‚úåÔ∏è When the sentence says \"in light of the above two statements\" by the law of association it means protection in the millitary sense. Just curious, what does CUET mean? PG is post graduate, right? The options have two parts, one is whether A (and B) is correct or not. Which don't have definite answer and would be debatable. So, an which states an opinion as 'correct' can't be correct. Second part (in options 1st and 2nd) is whether B is sufficient reason for A. Which would also be debatable and not be a question for MCQ. CUET is Common University Entrance Test. It's conducted by NTA. Yes, PG is Post Graduate. Now you've choose answers smartly depending on which kind of party's ruling. I think it should 4 But it's subjective. Mandatory service in India isn't feasible. It requires a lot of resources and imagine gangsters with military training The answer is brain-dead decision making Who set this paper? It seems so much like state level exam Its all subjective. How can they say first is right option. It doesn't make sense Yeah no. That is the reason the two statements are separate. The other can be just otherwise true without any other context. And that is why 4 is the correct option where will the cannon fodder come from?? If you choose 4 üòÖ 2 is the correct option NTA conducts the exam, so it would be the one setting the paper. But ig it wouldn't be a single person setting the paper, multiple people would be assigned to submit questions in different categories and computer would be selecting the questions for the exam. Assuming that questions aren't checked by NTA before exam, still this question should have been dropped, but it wasn't. 4th option is the most appropriate answer While it's idiotic th m to have that question and answer in the computer science paper, and the question itself comes from misguided notions of patriotism, a truly randomised draft or a compulsory military service is a much equitable alternative to forcing the most vulnerable to risk their lives for a country that has done the least for them and left them with no choice but to risk their lives to earn a half decent living. Chaiwale ke liye jaan dena zaroori hai!!! So that he can express his \"heartfelt condolences\" on g***d ki baat!!!!! Similar question came in HCS prelim exam Where they asked about safety valve theory. It doesn't have any consensus and most historians don't regard congress as safety valve It should have been 4. Everyone protects country in a way not necessarily through Military. 4 should be the correct answer imo Neither seems correct to me. Every citizen? Who's gonna grow food, heal the sick, take care of the kids, and myriads of different jobs required to run a society? If both are correct it's just a military nation. happens when dumb Hitler tries to do propaganda. You don‚Äôt know how to solve these type of questions. It‚Äôs a fairly easy question and answer 1 is correct. 4 is more like the safe option The question is correct. The question is yes statement A is assertion and statement R is reason for it. It‚Äôs not stating any fact. There are fairly common question in logical reasoning. I think this comment section is filled with middle schoolers who cannot separate general knowledge questions from reasoning questions. The options have two parts, one is whether A (and B) is correct or not. Which don't have definite answer and would be debatable. So, an option which states an opinion as 'correct' can't be correct. Second part (in options 1st and 2nd) is whether B is sufficient reason for A. Which would also be debatable and not be a question for MCQ. There are multiple types of questions which give two statements and 4 options regarding them. Not all are same. I disagree with the answer 1. The answer is No 2. A: Assertion- There are many countries in the world who mandate military service for a fixed period of time. Hence its hypothetical in that case the country would have the largest active and reserve military in the world. R: Reason- this is more practical, as a citizen its our duty to protect our country at all costs, however joining the military isn‚Äôt the only way. Conclusion- Both are correct but R is not the explanation for A Wrong First of all it's not logical reasoning, your defination of \"logical reasoning\" is vague, when taking competitive examinations into account the section of logical reasoning in assertion and reason should follow the principal of mathematical resoning rather than _\"oh i feel like it's makes more sense\"_ , if we were to follow your set of logic then there will be hundreds of different answer to the same question. It's already wierd as it is that why is assertion reason section exists in 'thinking and decision making' section, the majority of it should be subjective with a few objective question mixed in Question is not if 1 is correct, it is if 1 is an assertion. Did you even prepare for this exam. I have given CAT, XAT,CMAT and this is a fairly simple question Our country doesn't have a need or budget for voluntary army of young students I scored above 99 in both XAT and CAT in LR. I know what I am talking about. You are interpreting it wrong. When I had these questions in school, we had to answer whether the assertion itself is factually correct or not and if it is correct, whether the reason given is valid. See this is where you are .... Erm... On the wrong track.. If you have opinions different from the official ones... You'll be rejected here at this stage formally... So go on learn stuff correctly doesnt make you any the more right. the question has subjective decision making here, and it will vary vis person to person dont understand what your issue with the question is? both the question and answer are valid. there is no \"subjective\" view applicable in this question. Well what if a person's personal ideologies doesn't align with that of nation's? But person is still a law abiding citizen, what would happen in that case? Declared anti national and thrown in jail? Second case; what if country gets taken over by theologues or parties that have very different world view than your own, would you still be comfortable fighting and dying for the same nation when you know majority sides with them and there is no coming back? I think the concept of nationalism is flawed! I understand man should have respect for the nation in which he is born into, but above that is humanity, which is what one should be more true to. This whole concept of nationalism is very tribalistic tbh. But hey, we don't live in that sort of globalised world, so idk, am here just woolgathering and spitballing, and contemplating different scenarios. Correct answer should be 2. My interpretation is correct. You have not given these exams outside school where questions are more difficult than just assertions being straight fact. The fact that you have to resort to showcasing your achievements to prove your point says a lot lol. You are most probably a troll so not gonna argue further First try to understand what an assertion is actually. It‚Äôs not necessary for assertion to be fact. Only if the assertion is obviously wrong, like saying Earth is biggest planet in solar system it can be wrong. If so state India is best country in this world, it‚Äôs not factually wrong, it not factually correct but it‚Äôs an opinion which so can assert and therefore it‚Äôs an assertion What is your argument now? You look more of a troll actually >The question is correct. The question is yes statement A is assertion and statement R is reason for it. It‚Äôs not stating any fact. There are fairly common question in logical reasoning. It feels a little too open ended to be a logic question. The main issue is it is not clear that the only way to protect your country is through military service. Modiji ne nahi banaya paper ‚ò∫Ô∏è yes, you are right. These questions don't have anything to do with the factual correctness of the assertion. Its weather the reason fits correctly >Question is not if 1 is correct, it is if 1 is an assertion. You are wrong. By your logic, there won't ever be a question with the assertion being incorrect. Every statement that is made emphatically is an assertion. These types of questions will always have an assertion as the first statement. The question is if the statements are true, and if the second statement is the reason for the first. The concept is more easy to understand if the question asked is scientific (based on factual truth). Here's an example I took from a website: Assertion (A): Seeds should be treated with a fungicide solution. Reason(R): Seeds do not germinate, unless treated with a fungicide solution. Solution: First we will check if the assertion is true or not. In this case the assertion is true. Now we will check if the reason is true or false. In this case the reason is false, as Seeds are treated with fungicide before sowing to avoid seed borne disease. But, it is not a true fact that unless seeds are treated with a fungicide solution, they cannot germinate. Hence, option(c) is true. Countries that have mandatory conscription have populations in the neighborhood of Indian metros, hence the need for them. No country, even the US would be able to bear the cost for it to be implemented on a population of our size. It is correct. Its asking if its assertion or a reason for each statement An assertion can be an opinion What? üòÄ First of all how the hell did you got the picture of a question asked in cuetüò≠ It is correct that A is an assertion, also correct that R is the reason for it. Bro, this is a bank exam question. See how they checked facts in the solution? That's called reasoning. The assertion and reason need to be checked if true, only then they are correct. It can be opinions in the question, but the answer should be correct only if it's correct, simple as that. [Article 51A in The Constitution Of India 1949](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/867010/) >(c) to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; > >(d) to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; Reason R is not an opinion. Defense of country is a fundamental duty (not legally binding) of every citizen as enshrined in the constitution of India. So, it a fact based on the constitution. You can have an opinion that doesn't agree with that fact. Assertion A is an opinion based on that fact. You can also not agree with it. But the only logical reasoning for A is R. Personally, I agree with neither. US constitution goes a step further and requires that citizens take up arms to defend the country against a foreign invader or even a rogue govt. Outsiders who want to procure citizenship need to abide by it as well. It's just layer upon layer of assumptions by some shallow nationalist. I think the answer should be (2), as the reason doesn't satisfy assertion, \"every citizen should protect his country\" as this reason doesn't take account of disabled persons and kids who are also citizens of a country and lastly one doesn't have to be in the military to protect their country. And the reason is also excluding women from citizens of the country 4 Considering you are right, what would be the difference between a correct and an incorrect assertion? What's the meaning of a incorrect assertion? Can you please give an example? Assertion here is neither correct nor incorrect. Question of correctness doesn not apply to such assertions. I think it's like [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea) scheme called conscription, where every citizen of South Korea must fulfill a mandatory military training and service( some exceptions are there) .This is because South Korea has a small population, and need a trained army for North Korea. And since they have a small population, it's very easy to feed and provide for their citizens, which is not possible in India, since we have a 1+ billion population to provide. Although this scheme may be seem forceful, there are some benefits, especially **self defense**. During the [1992 Los Angeles Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots) in USA, Black Americans rioted and tried to loot shops, but Korean Americans were able to fend off and defend themselves thanks to South Korea mandatory military training. So although I don't think military training is compulsory, I believe that self defense training should be implemented, to teach people to protect themselves from attacks and criminals, remember the Sakshi murder in Delhi? She would have had a chance to protect herself if she knew some self defense And I also think that border states should have some kind of military training, like [Arunachal Pradesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeFMThuVF98), incase there is an invasion from our enemies Every IFS, IAS, IB, PSC, SSC, Railways, people working at ground level in NGOs, etc would be going \"wtf are we not protecting India?\". This is plain jingoism. Assertion - Reason questions are fairly common in competitive exams, but I don't understand how to treat this one. It's been a while since I last appeared for one but this question appears to lack context. Treating Assertion as opinion(may or may not be true) and reason as known fact(which may or may not justify the said assertion), for this specific question, option one suggests the only way to protect a country is military service, which is still an open statement that different people can interpret differently. Had the R statement been \"Every citizen must protect country against outside threats\", statement 1 would have been correct beyond doubt. Given the question I felt answer should be option 4. Only reason I explain my reasoning is because you seem to have more practice with this so I wanted a deeper perspective from you. Some countries have a requirement for all healthy men between ages 18-35 to serve in the military for at least a short period of time (range from 18 months to 5 years iirc). Maybe this is what the first is actually trying to say, maybe this will work for underdeveloped countries but India isn‚Äôt really in need of a massive Armed Force as it has no real threats atm and has a pretty powerful military. And D.... In this large population country ..our economy is not big as our population.... It's impossible to make compulsory ... The reason part is straightforward for me. Let‚Äôs ignore for now if assertion is wrong. If we assume that assertion is correct, i.e. Everyone should be be compulsorily inducted in military, then the reason every citizen should protect their country is valid. Suppose I say someone, I think military should be compulsory. The follow up question could be why do you think so? And my response to it being well every citizen should be responsible for safety of their own country. This is a valid argument. Now of course there can be counter arguments, but my argument is valid. So that makes reason correct and it explains the assertion. Now coming to is assertion correct. Well it‚Äôs not a fact , and neither a false statement. It‚Äôs an opinion based on valid points. Hence it can qualify as assertion. This option 1 is correct. That is how I would have answered it. If you remove the garbage learnt from social media, it is clearly mentioned 2nd is an reason for the first why would you say it is an opinion ? Assertion A: social media is effecting what our students are learning. Reason R: you just called a \"reason\" an opinion because you feel that. Answer is D. They don't want correct answers, they want to filter out people with dissenting opinions. This is a stupidly broad anaphylactic measure that will end up doing harm. This just filters out people who are biased towards being nuanced. There are so many ways to interpret this. Those countries have very small military force. And the citizens also pay less tax. So govt. take services from them. If I service in military becomes compulsary in India what would be a long time benefit of it for the person? See the example of US. They recruit 18 yr old young child in army. Then after 10yr when they leave army, they have to take up low paying jobs because they skipped on higher education and don't even have any entry level experience. If that's the case why only make military service compulsory. Every citizen should serve in healthcare, IT, hospitality, manufacturing, mining etc. Why military gets this special place as if they are the only ones who are patriot and think about this country while all others are just selfish people. >An assertion can be an opinion in that case saying the assertion is wrong, because you have a differing opinion shouldn't be wrong. It‚Äôs a question in which 1 is correct. I don‚Äôt support mandatory service especially with 1.4 billion people. What class are you ? True. That‚Äôs what I said in the last few sentences. I agree it‚Äôs an open ended and bit on vaguer side. Usually these questions have assertions which are straight up facts, but it‚Äôs not uncommon to see these opinionated assertions. I think 1 is right HERE. It's twisted but I guess it's right. OP there was a question in the UPSC CSE mains exam. How is secularism limiting our cultural independence . That question was bizarre because, our teachers told whoever made the question wanted to impress the Govt with some bootlicking. The guy seriously said that because of secularism we are not able to practice our culture lol. Why should military service be mandatory for citizens? Why not any other field be made compulsory? There are more important fields that run the country and not military. Option 1 can never be correct until and unless military service provides me with some benefit after the service. What has the country given me that I should serve in military just after coming out of school? Do office people not serve the country? Do railway people not serve the country? Or is it that only military people work is considered as a service to the country? Decision making is not just restricted to facts only. It also involves a fair deal of assumptions and logical conclusions. Quite Possibly, the question is nlt related to facts but relates to verbal logical reasoning. Stop getting so hyped. I just said how the question is valid and answer is correct. Assertion is wrong. As simple as that. What are talking about bru?! The answer for that is subjective. option 2 is correct and also assert domination Option 4 should be the correct answer. WTF!!! Doing literally everything to forcefully spread their ideology. I think BR Ambedkar is only person who they really would hate, for the constitution and for the values he instilled in people. South Koreans already have mandatory military service for men That's why I made the comment >Question is not if 1 is correct, it is if 1 is an assertion Then read the options again. It doesn't matter, but I have also given other such exams. If they ask if a statement is correct or not, it has to have a definite answer. This, for anyone saying 1, 2 or 3 as correct (that is, 1 is correct) If that was the case then what do they mean by when stating A as correct or incorrect? It's not grammar question. Whoever made this was really high on cheap gaja 2 All of these are wrong answers, the person being born didn't choose to be born in the country. You are saying a 1 month old should protect the country(the question says every citizen)? JUST No. This is a logical reasoning question so don't say they meant most citizen and not kids and all. So difference in opinion will also make you lose marks in exams now? Subtle. We are rotting inside. And who asks opinion based questions in mcq? High on nationalism rather. Glad my studies are over. Thank god. Country‚Äôs army, which is already struggling to provide correct salary and pensions to its soldiers, should provide employment to all (yes ALL) unemployed youth. Makes sense. That is how I have seen all options been written down. If your logic is right, then in what case will you say A is incorrect? Even if you negate A, by the logic you used it would still be correct. See online similar questions online. You will find that A is a fact which is either true or false. Like Kerala is the largest state in India The filament inside a bulb is made of copper or some mathematics questions where you have to calculate and check if it's correct or not. Both A and R are incorrect. That is the truth. Where do you get the questions of previous years from? How is R correct? Every citizen is a male?? Is this a comprehension based qn? If not, this makes no sense. Lol. Cancel NTA Where is none of the above Going by that from a software testing standpoint, on a hypothetical system where the \"should be\" wording is correct, then \"our country\" wording is not if it implies India when our underlying context could be anything, may or may not be India. Moreover, the Reason has the wording \"his country\" which again conflicts either of the above notions. Even if A is correct R is wrong. Whoever wrote this is telling the candidate to create a sandbox and yet uses words that refer things external to the sandbox. Where's the both are incorrect option? free marks YEAH LETS FUCKKKKKKKKKKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 4. We have the highest population in the world that is why we conduct exams like NDA to select the best suitable candidates. There is no need for compulsory military service for every citizen. A reason needs facts Not sure what your point is, but that's a dumb question and is indicative of systemic issues with our education system. Requiring the students to answer that the assertion \"Military service should be mandatory\" is correct is at best indicative of general incompetence of the paper setters and at worst intended to determine whether the student has the \"correct\" political opinions. (4) None are correct! But 4 me bhi toh same problem ho raha hai na. Tum kaise bol sakte ho definitely whether mandatory military service is correct or not. Ye koi fact thori hai? Ye toh opinion hai. Uss opinion ka logical reasoning second statement hai ki nehi ye question ho sakta hai, lekin idhar toh options ke phrasing hi galat lag raha hai. No, free marks weren't awarded, final answer key says 1 is correct. So only those who chose 1 would have got marks for that. There is also another question in which we had to complete a quote by Modi(about sports? iirc) The exam was Physical education/NCC and English for me. It appeared in the phys ed section. Completely avoided that question cuz I don't want any of my marks to come from propaganda If everyone will protect the country then whom will we are protecting as country is formed by people and all people are saving country Yo WTF ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ They 'have to work' towards making Modi a special person, a real special person don't need any such things. The same paper also had a match question, Modi's name in same column as Gandhi, Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Column was for authors!! They put Modi's name for Exam Warriors ü§¶üèæ. How obsessed the paper setter must be with him. I was going by logic that it's an opinion not a fact, so incorrect. I know not a good logic. But 4 seemed like the best option (least incorrect) That's a critical reasoning question You can't question a question in exam bro. You will hurt only yourself. 4. With a population like ours, we have the advantage to recruit the most well suited candidates. Like someone mentioned, our institutions are designed to train best officers and soldiers. Some neighbouring countries send their soldiers to our academies because we can afford to have better quality of soldiers than others and patriotism is not just an act but an emotion. Scientists and doctors in our country contribute towards the same cause without being trained as military personnel. >Reason R is not an opinion. Defense of country is a fundamental duty (not legally binding) of every citizen as enshrined in the constitution of India. So, it a fact based on the constitution. You can have an opinion that doesn't agree with that fact. Oh, didn't think from that POV. R can be said to be correct then, as it uses 'should' and protect can be in very different ways. But there have to be exclusions too. >Assertion A is an opinion based on that fact. You can also not agree with it. But the only logical reasoning for A is R. Yes, A is an opinion, which we can't say is correct or not. It says to make military service compulsory. If we go to check it's validity in constitution, it would require huge discussion, and won't have definite answer. And as far as I understand, it won't be legal without making some amendments. If the question asked whether R is correct reason for A, without asking whether A (and B) is correct, then the answer would have been a yes. >it is clearly mentioned 2nd is an reason for the first why would you say it is an opinion ? You surely haven't given such exams. The question labels it as 'Reason'. Candidate have to answer whether R is reason or not for A (2nd part of options 1 and 2). Question papers are available online. Answer key is available on official website. These are some examples of Assertions (A). (First 2 are copied from A-R Qs) * Kerala is the largest state in India * The filament inside a bulb is made of copper * Take some wrong mathematics statement Even though they are incorrect, they are still 'assertions' (wrong assertion), so would you still say these A are correct as they are assertions too? Assertion is sort of an opinion, a strong one at that which is used in an argument . Not a fact certainly. Absolutely fine. D is correct How is this even an assertion reason qs?? Ambedkar didn't write the constitution... Check the contributions he made to it for which he solely can be credited. Obviously he didn't write the whole constitution. He only contributed Reservations (not sure, will check)... that's done more harm than good as a whole. You don't know anything about Ambedkar and reservation. Hi, can you help me out with a link to where you got them from?"
