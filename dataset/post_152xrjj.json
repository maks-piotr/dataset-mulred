        "Your donation will go a long way, I’m very sorry I don’t want to burden anyone to fund if it’s difficult for them to spend extra. Just sharing the link or upvoting is also a great help for us. But thank you once again 🙏🏻",
        "Donated, my mom is also going through stage 4 cancer treatment. Good luck and I hope things get better for both our families!",
        "Thank you so much, wishing your mom a speedy recovery too. Hopefully our moms get cured soon, God willingly 🤞🏻",

        "What kind of idiotic logic is this? Do you seriously think that everyone who lives in Mumbai or Goa has the means to have 10L or even 1.5L at their disposal? Do you understand that everyone that lives in Mumbai is not a white collar worker or a business man?",
        "Your donation will not help her. Op if you don’t have kindly visit delhi cancer hospital near Gtb hospital Dilshad garden.Delhi. Every state has many such institutions where free treatment is given for cancer.\nSuch online support aren’t trustworthy. \nKindness of the fellow Redditors shouldn’t be misused.",

        "May I ask what is your age? And do you have a job or not?",

She has severe anxiety too can’t travel anywhere outstation. I appreciate your concern please pray for us, hopefully shes gets better.",
        "I saw a fundraiser some times back of a girl asking for a donation to study abroad .. like seriously? Is India that bad? Why don't you study for a jee ? Do hard work and get into a good college and go abroad for a job ? But no you want donation cause its easy you just open a site and post your fundraiser here and there and boom done , no hard work required!! People starts fundraiser likes its nothing! \nI do donate money! But you people who seriously needs it   \n\nMy father is alcoholic and we struggle financially but we never went to some ngo or started a fund raiser.. meri mummy used borrowed money from relatives and always returned the money whenever she had some , i dont usually borrow money but when i do i return them as soon as well and with little extra everytime , I work hard so i can repay all the karja .. i can easily start a fund raiser but I don't instead I work hard",
        "Im 21, yes I had a freelance job, but now im unemployed, looking for online jobs.",
        "Yes i seriously think that , read my other comment",
        "If you have a vehicle then do try for delivery jobs (they don't pay much but will be better than staying unemployed while you are looking for other jobs)",
        "You should mention this in your fundraiser as well as here 😄",
        "The fundraiser was done on behalf for us after hearing my father out on a phone call, he did mention that to them, but that’s how they have selected what to keep and not.",
        ">I saw a fundraiser some times back of a girl asking for a donation to study abroad\n\nThis is a completely different situation though.\n\n>I work hard so i can repay all the karja .. i can easily start a fund raiser but I don't instead I work hard\n\nSure thing tough guy.\n\nI appreciate the skepticism that you showed in your previous comments but now you're being ridiculous.",
        ">i can easily start a fund raiser but I don't instead I work hard\n\nAnd? What do you want to prove?",
        "Contributed my bit. Hope she recovers soon! God bless..",
        "Thank you so much, your support is much appreciated, God bless :)",
        "Yeah, I already saw your other comment about the tests and the new ones that you made later as well and I came to the conclusion that you are an absolute moron who has no sense of reality of the world that you live in. Your ignorant and   immature comments are inexcusable unless you are a 12 year old spoilt brat.\n\nOP had already posted biopsy report in the link which confirms the carcinoma. \n\nYou have no clue about the disease and what kind of physical, mental toll it has on the people who have to take care of the patient. I happen to have my aunt treated and its not pretty.\n\nOnce endometrial cancer reaches stage 4, surgical options are often meaningless  and your only chance is chemo and radiotherapy and you have a survival rate of  15%.\n\nWhat does your father being an irresponsible alcoholic has anything to do with this context. Everyone has their own personal situations and hardships including me.  \n\nSave your preaching for when your mother gets cancer and you have to stay at home to take care of her and you don't have enough income to get her treated. Then you can brag how you would rather let your mother die because you are too proud to do whatever you need to do you save her.",
