    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I see this community is helping a lot of people. I work in a village called Sagroli and there‚Äôs a primary school teacher whose wife is suffering from Leukaemia. She‚Äôs admitted in Tata Memorial Hospital and needs a bone marrow transplant to stay alive. This teacher is still here working hard so he can make some money. He has exhausted all his savings on the treatment till now. They have two small children: Krushna is 7th grade and Gayatri is 9th grade. I met both the children as well. Please help this family if you can. The patient is still 38 years of age and it‚Äôs horrible what has happened to her. I got their fundraiser verified on Ketto and he now has some hopes from it. \nDonate whatever little you can: https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/my-wife-is-fighting-for-her-life-and-we-need-your-support-to-save-her-964970?utm_source=external_Ketto&utm_medium=google-search&utm_campaign=S14_1000_SALE_Brand_KY_ALL_CLK_IND&utm_term=e_ketto&utm_content=medical_resp_ad2&utm_placement=KT01_AG_1865_BrandSeed_Pure",
