    "selftext": "A dramatic incident unfolded in Madhya Pradesh's Ashoknagar district where Kalu alias Salim Khan, 22, attempted to abduct a 21-year-old woman he had previously raped, from her wedding. The event occurred around 6 pm when Kalu, along with accomplices Jodha, Sameer, and Shahrukh, stormed the woman's house, assaulting her family and dragging her out. Despite the chaos, timely intervention by neighbors prevented the abduction, leading to the accused fleeing the scene. The police initially hesitated to register the case but did so after pressure from a local Hindu outfit. Two FIRs were filed, one for rape and attempted kidnapping and another for assault and intimidation.\n\n\n",
