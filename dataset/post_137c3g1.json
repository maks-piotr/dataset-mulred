It's said that he has an influence on 12 LS seats. He is not some small goon. He used to do Chai party with Vajpayee and has been an MP for 6 terms now. He has made countless schools and has shit tons of land on his name. His entire family is placed in various posts of several Wrestling federations. You saw Babita Phogat there? Bhushan was the one who made her director in Haryana women wrestling association. He can out her anytime he wants and for her it seems, that post matters more than her own sister. BJP will protect him at all costs. You just wait and watch. This party is all about vote politics only. It knows Thakurs are too loyal to it and they don't want Bhushan to go in jail. I have already seen many Rajput associations twitter accounts defending him and posting shit about these women protesters. Bjp has already compared their worth to Bhushan worth and as anyone can see,  Bhushan is more valuable to them. They gonna protect him no matter what shame it can bring to them because bjp knows the memory of this country is a short one. Once it will open Ram Mandir next year, all will be forgotten and even those protesting might end up voting for it just like Jats of UP did in last UP election despite them protesting against BJP for an year.",

Pretty much everyone in the BJP has skeletons in their closets and they do not want to invite any kind of pressure that would make them have to deal with it.\n\n(On the other hand, it is interesting to note how much more pliable to pressure the previous Congress government was. Shashi Tharoor once had to resign because of a tweet in which he used the phrase \"cattle class.\" The only people protesting against it were other parliamentarians from the BJP.)",

I hope other people who are on top of their field understand how their glory will be hogged by a person for their own gain but when time comes they will be ditched without a second thought by that same person. If you can't criticize that person at least don't choose his side. Nazi modus operandi being repeated. If you are not aware then pls stop forming stupid opinions This govt is too arrogant to apologise and make a guy resign....no one resigns... Given Mudiji quikly jumps on the selfie with sportspersons bandwagon, this Brij Bhushan must have something pretty damning against someone pretty powerful if he is not even resigning from his post Aah the Epstein defence BJP and BJP andhbhakts doesn‚Äôt care about our nation or it‚Äôs people. They just want BJP to stay in power. They are the real anti nationals. Desh drohis. Laughable. I still remember all the hate they spewed against the women of Shaheen Bagh. Common man doesn't get justice, he gets juiced by [the juicer](https://youtu.be/0NuivJMFPkg). Kabhi Kabhi Lagta Hai... ![gif](giphy|MRG6k5gsTfASjBzTQr) ...Apun Hi Bhagwan Hai That clown likes campaigning for elections more than governing. Wish he kept PM post and continued with circus but appointed able men like Gadkari to govern. Gadkari is one exception. Rest are chest thumping clowns who know just arrogant talk and posturing. My heart cries for this lost decade for India. With clear thumping majority, even sky wasn't a limit. But these clowns turned it into a pissing contest. Dangai aur mawalion se izzat ki baat? All the silent sportsperson earning millions should know that they could be next. Not before 2024. Nothing is more imp than that. Not even a completely \"for-show\" resignation people can be afraid. do not forget that. The problem with BJP is its arrogance and ego. How dare they make us apologise ? Phogat on people protesting against NRC are anti-national and Pakistani, and farmers protesting against farm bill are khalistani. Ab ka huwi chori tane tu koun hai ? Maybe that's why they are silent . They don't want the spotlight of CBI , ED and IT cells. Yahan pe toh ye actually hai That Gujju is 73. Heard they are returning all their medals now. Soon they will all be part of Award Wapisi gang. Karma Against everyone from JNU, Tabliqi, Shaheen Bagh, all CAA protestors. I firmly believe they will still vote for BJP if bjp removes Bhushan even a day before elections. The sheer amount of effort being out to defend a gangster, what's the difference between him and ateeq. Shouldn't our blood thirsty media demand his encounter as well. Instead they are working hard to restore his image. Gadkari is not an exception. Right from changing the way road calculations are done (4-lane 1km stretch=4km development to show record breaking numbers), building while ignoring environmental studies (think of all the landslides in hilly areas) to straight up corruption (Scania luxury bus story) he's done it all. He's just a hardcore RSS guy so he gets very sheltered. 56 Inch ka seena h bhai. Aise hi thodi apni galti Maan lega. /s Absolutely love the stand up by Varun Grover. Waiting for his next gig &#x200B; ![gif](giphy|1fuPzz0fWrCmEeqXi3) And the conversion of roads to concrete ones under the guise of green roads, just as that galactus swallows cement companies. Its a show of loyalty, you scratch my back I scratch yours. Saving (or not saving) sets a precdent and sends a message to the other party members, which, is this case is, \"Be loyal to us and no one can touch you\". Otoh, convicting him would send a different message, which a party full of criminals wouldn't find ideal. Everyone will realize now or later.. Even the Godhi Media will be thrown under the bus for the good of Modiji.. They are not interfering because they know comom people will never give up their entertainment. I suggested, protest against this by giving up IPL viewing..i got downvoted to oblivion. We all are very much.enraged, but only at our convenience, right... This is GOLD..!! These arent celebrities, they are regular people, hard working regular people, just as the rest of us. All the sports persons participating in various events throughout India, need to pull out, right NOW! Same goes for you guys watching IPL. STOP. RIGHT. NOW. If I am not wrong, that is Babita phogat not Vinesh phogat. Also Babita is phogat is not part of wrestlers protest. Are Babu Bhaiya Aap Idhar ku 5.6 mm gobhi ji ki pp energy going strong TrueüòÇ If all this was happening at any other time period, would have agreed to your point. But this is election time and the govt would be worried about it's image more than anything. Guy is running around Bangalore with circus show leaving God knows who to do the government work. So, obviously, Brij must have some hardcore dirt on something for them to risk their image in front of the whole nation. Especially, given that the ppl who are protesting now were (are still) their loyal supporters. Exactly. Babita has turned after yesterday's police struggle. Also the guy tweeted something about dogs being more grateful. ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ï‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§è‡§ï ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡§æ ‡§µ‡§´‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§® ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§á‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§®‡§æ‡§ú ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à ‡§´‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§´‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ã ‡§™‡§æ‡§è ‡•§‡•§ 4x1 is global rule. This is the only thing this govt picked from global standards as it suited its narrative. Only Cricketers are celebrities here - other sports person are just like normal people barring a few exceptions here and there Whenever the Regime Changes, the first thing they should do is to formulate strict Sedition and Treason Laws, and prosecute all the goons today and their supporters. This isn't actually a right take tbh. If I am watching English football then that doesn't mean I am supporting Ukraine in Russian war. This is vague take. You can always watch what you like but the first part where everyone should start is actually on your social media accounts. People who aren't good at the art that they do are probably the most entitled ones barking just because they have followers. How will boycotting ipl can directly help the case? And just like I said above even if you want to start a boycott start on social media because this is where it hurts. This is just a reminder as well that Coward Kohli still hasn't said anything about this, but was too quick to post some statuses about Naveen and Gambhir. This is exactly my thoughts as well You really think cricketers specially women, won't be facing similar issues? BJP bhagaao, desh bachaao. If you smile in his selfies then you are the gold medal winning athlete. If you protest then you will be punished by the police. This is the justice system of India. He is a locally-powerful politician, as well as a hindutva mascot and mafia don. He has boasted about his murders on TV, with no consequences. See e.g. [‚ÄòDon of all dons, murderer, wrestling reformer‚Äô ‚Äî WFI chief & MP Brij Bhushan‚Äôs colourful life](https://theprint.in/india/don-of-all-dons-murderer-wrestling-reformer-wfi-chief-mp-brij-bhushans-colourful-life/1323788/) The one's who voted for the clown wanted the circus What is opposition doing? Why is this not a national issue? usko bolna ki ye anaj tu baatne aya tha humko kya? The ruthlessness of the BJP shown by the fact that a few years ago her ~~father and sister~~ cousins were welcomed to the BJP with much fanfare. And now being crushed by the same party. Joins a long list of others. But our public continues to be under the impression that mudi knows best. Country is fucked. Edit: ~~I won't lie, I'm only human and felt a tinge of schadenfreude considering the phogats earnest demonization of Shaheen bagh protesters.~~ apparently the poghats who joined the BJP were her cousins. Apologies, and a good reminder to check ones facts before posting. This is not a political issue. Don‚Äôt make it political Imagine how the government is protecting an accused paedophile. He is no saint by any measure by the number of cases filled against him and his behaviour in public life. The number of criminals in our political system has progressively increased and police have become just a pawn to the party in power. Time has come and gone for police reforms, stricter criteria for accused criminals and independent institutions. It would backfire just like UAPA. We need laws to empower the common citizen not the system. While i see all this issues come up all of a sudden. Even I see many political parties involved too in making such issues. I mean many times so many things are just politically motivated and tool of other political parties too. I don't know how to trust anyone now a days. things went real bad real quick. small youtubers posting few videos - and these are very very disheartening. how this doesn't upsets anyone who has a daughter/sister ?? this one image sums-up the \"justice\" in India for anyone who dont have association with modi. The whole world stands with you. The unique thing about mafia is that no one is safe. If you go against anyone more powerful in the mafia, irrespective of your previous association with the group, you too will suffer same fate. You can take any name associated with the govt. The moment they go or have to go against any part of government stronger than them, they'll be treated similarly. > 71-year-old Gujarati guy screaming Jai bajrang Bali and roaming around Bangalore we from Karnataka provide employment for all short of people from all state, we dont alienate people based on their home state, and including elderly folks those were abandoned by their family. And i bet the per hour labour rate in bangalore is 5-6 times more then Gujarat. so let the poor fellow earn his daily wages in whatever task assigned by his master. Dangai aur mawalion se izzat ki baat? and dont forget the toll tax moolah helping inflation :) > That Gujju is 73. this wil be considered as gaali number 92. Ofcourse, women face sexism on a daily basis but how many of them are speaking at the moment? That's the issue. They all went haywire when Jay Shah announced WIPL but are mum now. Where are Harmanpreet, Shefali & Smriti? Of course it may threaten their career and fame, but that's what standing up is all about, and their words have power. Have no hopes from Kohli, Gambhir or anyone anyways. Make criteria for conviction very explicit, and these goons will satisfy even the most progressive and easy interpretation of law. Almost childish at how stubborn they are. They feel the need to protect every last crook instead. I feel like joining BJP is the best insurance against any crime you have committed if they protect their own this much Who all remember famous sportspersons and bollywood actors tweeting about ‚ÄúBlack lives matter‚Äù? Where are they now? Fucking clout chaser. It is meant to send a message. Commoners can't challenge BJP. It is hubris that stops BJP from acting against Brij Bhushan. It sets a very dangerous precident, for them, that citizens can actually challenge authority if they are persistent. A complete anarchy and dictatorship in India. Although India is the largest democracy in the world, but still why does it seem that it is slowly moving away from the system. Only yesterday the name came in the world's 30 worst countries in the Press Freedom Index and on the same day the police beat up the athletes. Doesn't it work like this? You learn from Sweden that there is just one girl \"Greta Gunberg\" whose protest made the whole world talk about the matter of the environment. But in India, The Govt. itself is running from those issues and trying it's best to divert the topic and it is better not to have any hope from the media which comes on number 161. anyone who speaks against risks getting sidelined at best and Ed cbi, trolled, killed at worst. who will have the courage to speak even? I genuinely hope the wrestlers get justice. When things were better they used to be very overt outlet of the BJP IT Cell. This is a classic example of leopard ate my face Where is Sachin Tendulkar now? isn‚Äôt this not an ‚Äúinternal matter‚Äù? are woh doosri phogat hai. once you join mafia you are protected as long as you remain with the mafia. not to mock the current misery but he himself will be termed the same sooner or later. reluctance of opposition to join this protest makes so much more sense. And then they came for me‚Ä¶..??? just watch tweets by these current victims. they all followed bjp line in mocking the victims. caste These people clapped when other protestors were hit, and jailed. Not so fun when it‚Äôs you no? Already happening. Some BJP supporters are already trivializing their sporting achievements, and making other shitty remarks like this is some sort of \"made up drama\", whatever that means Any sportsperson other than a male cricketer is hardly a celebrity in India. yes, but they are equally vulnerable . they face risk of Ed, cbi, getting lynched. it's an atmosphere of fear for everyone. I don't think you understood what I said. Celebrities are safe from most of that. Even if a case is filed against them, they have the means and resources to stay mostly safe. That includes sportspersons who have gone professional, like Sunil Chhetri or Vijender Singh. Amateur sportspersons, who represent India at an amateur level in the Olympics, Asian Games etc. don't have the means to protect themselves. > turned after yesterday's police struggle. means ? going against BJP will get the entire family thrown under the bus. ----- people need to know who is Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. This is the guy who has connection with dawood ibrahim, Atal Bihari sends him apology letter - tooks him out of tihar jail, he murdered people and accepts in TV, etc. He is bigger then the Gujarati duo. if that toothless Teni's son is roaming free, this guy is untouchable. I understood but I disagree that celebrities are safe. they are equally if not more vulnerable. the government has a habit of setting an example for any one dissenting. even top sports person speaking against government can face harassment and risk to life. I understood but I disagree that celebrities are safe. they are equally if not more vulnerable. the government has a habit of setting an example for any one dissenting. even top sports person speaking against government can face harassment and risk to life. Such a great country and people are trying to stand for a crook like brij bhushan. A mafia who has so many cases and who have even accepted on live tv that he has done a murder . Entire 'bi ki pee' it cell has come forward to protect this goon. What a sad nation we are turning into . Motichoor even didn't say a word . But was the first one to do the \"foto-ops\" when these wrestlers won medals. \"Mujhe 91 baar gali di \" magalomanic is busy crying on this issue Who are the dumb people upvoting this stupid comment? That was Vinesh Phogat's sister **Babita Phogat** who is a BJP worker. There has always been disagreements in public between the two about politics, and Vinesh had even called out her sister on Twitter when she was going off during the Farm Laws protests. I feel ashamed. What have they done to our country. Wasn't he jailed under TADA for links with D-company? Does the labour rate also include free cellphones thrown by mistake? What a mess man. Why is the BJP all so silent today? Why isn't the WFI chief resigning? Cause he's an MP in BJP. Blame games can be played but the truth is Gangsters get to become MPs no matter which government. No wonder the officials who were so happy on Atiq's encounter are all silent today. Should another encounter happen today? Hypocrisy While some of their fellow wrestlers will just keep shut to save their jobs. Or hope to get tickets for parliamentary or state elections which they might still lose like the last time. He might have been scared of raids on the fantasy sports app in which he has some stake. Or other companies. The difference, as I said, lies in the fact that celebrities have the means to fight off the challenges thrown at them. These athletes do not. Still all labourers and farmers will vote bjp blindly -_- Just how congress was before their demise I think everyone should put this in their status, this can be turning point like Nirbhaya and people may realise who they are supporting are no god. Also most of people don‚Äôt even know they are protesting, it should reach everyone. They earned this. This will bring BJPs downfall in the 24‚Äô elections agreed. Babita Phogat is not her real sister. She is her cousin. What is that? Sorry if dumb question In UP, Caste matters too much. This Bhushan guy is a Thakur, same caste Yogi belongs to. Yogi rule has proven to be a paradise for Thakurs. They are being placed everywhere, from committies, associations, panchayats.. you see a seat, a thakur will be there. Brij Bhushan is one of the biggest faces of Thakur caste. It's said that he has an influence on 12 LS seats. He is not some small goon. He used to do Chai party with Vajpayee and has been an MP for 6 terms now. He has made countless schools and has shit tons of land on his name. His entire family is placed in various posts of several Wrestling federations. You saw Babita Phogat there? Bhushan was the one who made her director in Haryana women wrestling association. He can out her anytime he wants and for her it seems, that post matters more than her own sister. BJP will protect him at all costs. You just wait and watch. This party is all about vote politics only. It knows Thakurs are too loyal to it and they don't want Bhushan to go in jail. I have already seen many Rajput associations twitter accounts defending him and posting shit about these women protesters. Bjp has already compared their worth to Bhushan worth and as anyone can see, Bhushan is more valuable to them. They gonna protect him no matter what shame it can bring to them because bjp knows the memory of this country is a short one. Once it will open Ram Mandir next year, all will be forgotten and even those protesting might end up voting for it just like Jats of UP did in last UP election despite them protesting against BJP for an year. I think they already hit the peak with aryan khan. Corrected. Literally every national party, no one knows how much money they earn, rallies take crosses before elections and there's no way a corporate company is willing to give that much funds, there are other channels for other parties. You don't know what they are doing unless you follow their media handles cause Godi media is avoiding this protest like the plague. Also, as an ethically & morally responsible citizen, what are you doing? Questioning the opposition, when this question should be asked of the Govt? yes. also under gangster act in UP six times. He confessed to murder on live camera. [https://twitter.com/rohini\\_sgh/status/1616260381940518912?lang=en](https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1616260381940518912?lang=en) But u wont see media demanding his encounter I am asking opposition why haven't they made it a national issue. Why isn't it on headlines everywhere? I know godi media wouldn't show it but where is anti godi media? Social media is soo cheap and easy to get mass support. Opposition is there to help in such situations. Unfortunately it has come to this that we're now fearing to speak against the Government - the thing which most concerned citizens are afraid of. I feel so sad looking at the constant decline of political climate of the country. It's not that. The BJP has always projected an image of strength and wants to cultivate this image that they do not give in to demands made by anybody (legitimate or otherwise). Making an exception and listening to the protesters this time does not align with BJP's self image. They may also be afraid that if they give in once there would be many other similar protests cropping up against their other ministers. Pretty much everyone in the BJP has skeletons in their closets and they do not want to invite any kind of pressure that would make them have to deal with it. (On the other hand, it is interesting to note how much more pliable to pressure the previous Congress government was. Shashi Tharoor once had to resign because of a tweet in which he used the phrase \"cattle class.\" The only people protesting against it were other parliamentarians from the BJP.) Prompt action by the government was needed but they did not anything. May be BJP knows, their inaction will attract the Congress and Left, giving their entire event a anti BJP, anti Modi campaign. and they will churn the votes out of this before KA elections. I feel for the wrestlers, just imagine, these players have connections and still they are struggling to get justice on a serious allegation of sexual misconduct. Common people do not even stand a chance. This country was/is/will be run by the rich, mighty and goons. and then they complain we are getting low ranking in happiness index. Tell that to Joe Pesci No, it won't. These wrestlers will themselves vote for Modi in '24. BrijBhushan has immense clout in local UP politics - hence no reaction from BJP. BJP does not want to lose the votes he brings, period. It does not care about \\*minor\\* details like whether he is a criminal / sexual assaulter etc. It is for the same reason that you dont see SP (Akhilesh Yadav) saying anything in support of the wrestlers, while all other parties have. SP sees a chance of getting BrijBhushan to join them, if BJP is forced to take action against him. Except the lady who called the Prophet a pedo..didn't she resign?..I guess it depends on who the govt official has offended. I want to save it but I'm afraid I'll be erased out of existence before I wake up. Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs son needed 30 days. A common person is much lower down the rungs. Get in line. Us normies suffer this regularly This country is the mother of democracy if anyone forgets. Coz of international pressure, He is still the best. He gets the job done well no matter what. There are no better leaders. People like MMS are extreme exception. But we abused him for not being a politician like others. We deserve to rot under a vishwa guru. I might be wrong but i think it's about hathras case,you can check it on Google if you want to know about it but it's a very disturbing case. Thank you modiji. Under congress rule, we could never imagine this. I bet they cheered when women at shaheen bag were harassed Technically he was killed before he was a made man Boycotting ipl will reduce the revenue money.. money is what people cares about. So they will also get \"enraged\" and may actually open their mouths in support of the actual athletes.. [they will trust panchayat's judgement not HC or SC](https://twitter.com/priyankadeo/status/1654361970219548672) so much sympathy for these wrestlers There have already been 3 separate investigations from what I have read and nothing has been found to apportion guilt. Plus, these ‚Äòdharnas‚Äô are prone to regularly get hijacked by anti-* that Govt turns a deaf ear‚Ä¶ shaheen bagh, farmers protests to name some. There seems to be more than what meets the eye. Add to this their shifting stance from resign to no confidence to no national but straight to olympics. Exactly. They have higher chances of winning when they go against the bullies but it's said : Vinaash Kaale Viprit Buddhi. They care more about present than their future."
