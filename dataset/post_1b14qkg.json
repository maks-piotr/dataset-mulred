Given that instances of creation, use,  and dissemination of AI-generated synthetic media have surfaced in the [recent past](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/20/deepfake-democracy-behind-the-ai-trickery-shaping-indias-2024-elections?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), both domestically and [internationally](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/23/ai-deepfakes-come-of-age-as-billions-prepare-to-vote-in-a-bumper-year-of-elections?ref=static.internetfreedom.in),  we request all Indian political candidates and affiliated organisations  to publicly commit not to use deepfakes technology to create deceptive  or misleading synthetic content in the run-up to and during the 2024  general elections. \n\n## Why should you care?\n\nElections  are the cornerstone of any democracy, and the legitimate and  responsible use of technology can empower citizens in a way that  harnesses the true potential of elections. The ethical use of technology  has certainly served to increase electoral legitimacy, curb  malpractices, and broaden outreach. However, the negative affordances of  technology have the potential to create disruptions in the functioning  of a fair and ethical election. \n\nAdvancements in technology have  led to the emergence of sophisticated and complex systems that can  deceptively alter the flow of information in digital and physical  spaces. One such evolving and emerging technology is deepfakes – digital  content that has been manipulated or synthesised using deep learning  models to appear authentic – which may be circulated through various  forms of media. Given the low rates of media and information literacy as  well as the divisive politics in the country, the severity of threats  posed by synthetic media must be acknowledged at the earliest.\n\n## Our demands\n\nInstances  of creation, use, and dissemination of such AI-generated synthetic  media have been increasing in the country, with use cases ranging from  language translation to financial fraud (see [here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgedjb/the-first-use-of-deepfakes-in-indian-election-by-bjp?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), [here](https://theprint.in/india/celeb-deepfakes-just-the-tip-revenge-porn-fraud-threat-to-polls-form-underbelly-of-ai-misuse/1841666/?ref=static.internetfreedom.in), and [here](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-among-top-targets-of-deepfake-identity-fraud-2472241-2023-12-05?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)).  Although the positive affordances of such a technology are several, the  consequences of its misuse, especially in the election context, may be  grave. While much of the focus of the incumbent government is on  reiterating the obligations of platforms and identifying regulatory  avenues to curb the spread of such content on social media platforms,  there is also a pressing need to interrogate the use of deepfakes  technology by political actors with the intent to impact electoral  outcomes. \n\nAlthough more broad-based research is required to  establish that the circulation of synthetic media directly affects  voting patterns, the use of deepfakes for disseminating misleading or  deceptive narratives about political candidates and affiliated  institutions may affect voter perspectives, sentiments, as well as their  behaviour. Targeted misuse of the technology against candidates,  journalists, and other actors who belong to gender minorities, may  further deepen inequities in the election. Such methods, if widely  employed, even have the potential to impact electoral outcomes, thus  painting a concerning picture for electoral integrity. \n\nOver the  years, political parties have been able to establish sophisticated  channels for information dissemination and campaigning, which can be  used for the widespread circulation of manipulated media among voters.  The ability to derail or discredit another candidate’s campaign or to  even make false and fictitious claims to bolster one’s campaign existed  in previous elections. However, the ability to do that in the upcoming  elections with such generative technology, that is also readily and  freely available to everyone, may have drastic implications on a large  scale – such as voters being deliberately misinformed, affecting their  ability to exercise their democratic right to cast a free and informed  vote. \n\nGiven that instances of such misuse have surfaced in the recent past, both domestically and internationally, **we request all political candidates and affiliated organisations to publicly commit not to use deepfakes technology to create deceptive or misleading synthetic content in the run-up to and during the 2024 general elections** (see [here](https://www.boomlive.in/decode/how-ai-generated-images-took-centre-stage-in-telangana-elections-24076?ref=static.internetfreedom.in) and [here](https://www.boomlive.in/decode/deepfake-elections-disinformation-bangladesh-india-us-uk-indonesia-24087?ref=static.internetfreedom.in)).  We urge political representatives to oppose the use of such  disinformation campaigns before elections and request them to be aware  and take action against the physical circulation of synthetic content.  \n\n## What can you do?\n\nWe shared the open letter with Parliamentarians, union leevel  and regional political parties, and their affiliated organisations to  ask for their endorsement of this letter. This letter is also open for  signatures from the public till March 01, 2024. If you are concerned  with the misuse of synthetic media and its impact on our ability to cast  an informed and free vote, please consider signing the letter. Each signature strengthens our demands as well as our attempt to achieve free and fair elections.\n\n[https://blocksurvey.io/open-letter-to-electoral-candidates-parliamentary--tpj.3W4ITreZ3Iacqkmt6w?v=o](https://blocksurvey.io/open-letter-to-electoral-candidates-parliamentary--tpj.3W4ITreZ3Iacqkmt6w?v=o) \\- Sign Here!\n\n*We  would like to thank MediaNama, Point of View, Digital Empowerment  Foundation, Access Now, One Future Collective, Mazdoor Kisan Shakti  Sangathan, Young Leaders for Active Citizenship, Maadhyam, Article 21  Trust, India Civil Watch International for their inputs on the letter,  and for publicly endorsing it.
