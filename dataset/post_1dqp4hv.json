        "For those wondering why South Indian states rant about tax devolution, here‚Äôs the answer :\n\nFor every 100 rupees paid in direct taxes : Bihar ( similarly its neighbouring states)  gets 922 rupees and Maharashtra , Karnataka get something like 7 rupees and 13 rupees respectively \n\nIt‚Äôs not like we dont want the development of other states especially the poorer ones and we are more than happy to help, but where is the money flowing? Where is the accountability? Have their Human development indices improved? Has their per capita improved? Has poverty decreased? Have more schools been built? Etc etc\n\nIts not like we South Indians are living in a lala land and our situation is somehow utopian in absolute terms but in relative terms South states are farrrrrrrrrrrrrrr better than their northern counterparts.",
