Bhaskaracharya proof of pythagorean theorem- Bhaskara gave two proofs of it, one which was arithmetic and unknown to rest of the world, the other pictorial in nature, though there is resemblance in it, they were not the same yet Needham stated they were the same, The zero- the chinese invented rod numerals which is very close to modern numerals, an empty box existed instead of zero but needham called that understanding of zero even though chinese never ended a problem with it(never gave zero as an answer) nor stated operations with it, and it was during tang dynasty that zero symbol was introduced, zero as a digit was absent in ancient china? But here are achievements which never occured anywhere else 4) Chinese remainder theorem and kuttaka- Needham stated that this is another example of chinese influence on India, but many authors like victor j katz, kim plofker, david mumford(yes the fields winning mathematician), george joseph and ofcourse jean claude martzloff stated that they are different, Indian method was superior as it was more algorithmic and had other changes and is the precursor of  [Extended Euclidean algorithm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) \n\n [Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics) \\- origin of math analysis with infinite series of sine, cosine, arctangent, several others for pi, error correction algorithm in this context, mean value theorem and so on.
