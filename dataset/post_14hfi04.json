        "I have serious doubts whether these set of parties can develop a non-compromised common platform.\n\nI can see AAP jostling for a prominent position. Nitish for a potential PM candidate naming. Mamta as king maker. Rahul as behind the scenes string puller. A potential chaos.\n\nHowever, I think that the conditions are getting ripe for these parties to band together and provide a solid narrative to if not Modi then who. While if not Modi then who is a ruse, Indians have bought into it.\n\nThe opposition needs to show that they have many many strong faces vs only one at BJP. They need to use slogans like\n- if not Modi then who - Yogi?? Know that people in general don’t like Yogi!\n- after Modi who? Yogi??\n\nThere are various strategies that the opposition can use but the most important is to not take on BJP on the hindutva ideology. Build a separate platform that builds on the dreams of the citizens. Hindutva ideology can be reshaped post elections",
        "I don't think they're going to bring in any religious issue. It seems clear that they will make constitution and caste their platform. And as terrible the second one sounds its both the only thing that possibly can counter hindutva and somewhat necessary in the current environment (I find it ironic that those who are obsessed with the population figures of the minority religions are so scared of caste figures of their own) \n\nAnd yes the opposition seems like a mess, even yesterday Kejriwal left in the middle of the meeting, Nitish said he \"had to leave for delhi\" but he had already threatened to walk out. \n\nThey can definitely fight separately brs, considering brs wasn't there yesterday. But a third front will just ensure that anti bjp vote will split and hand bjp the seats. Both aap and brs know that.\n\nAnd that's the main thing pulling them together. They very well know that a 3rd term for modi will definitely be disastrous for their parties, if not for the constitution.  \n\nThe \"who will play what\" part won't that difficult to settle between congress and its former allies. Mamta, Nitish would both like lead things in their states and get main position if in government for them/their party. Tussle will be with aap, brs etc. Not just in seat sharing but also sharing in potential govt. \n\nAgain, I think \"if not modi then who?\" is a thing that they should try make a non topic, because they frankly don't have an answer to it. They don't have someone with the development oriented, (manufactured) clean image and oratory skills like him. They can't take him head to head in rallies etc. \n\nAnd even if they managed to prop someone up the various parties won't want someone from another party to become a big image leader in the coalition. It is most probably gonna be another congress leader for the top post, but one without much influence. \n\nHowever, atleast according to me, they should announce a pm face beforehand. Its not like congress completely lacks leaders with a clean image, its just the mass appeal part. And for that they should only take modi head on head in one thing, a prime ministeral debate.",

What is also very clear from the Congress president's election is that they and their supporters are not ready to throw away the dynasty. That's why I said Congress is not India—don't portray Congresses failure as India's failure.          \n\nVajpayee didn't lose because he didn't have a dynasty though, nor did Congress win because it had a dynasty. It might have been the \"India shining for who\" propaganda, or something else, but it's not true that people don't care about work. They just have different preferences on what they consider productive work that is valuable for them. I wouldn't think the current government has done any worse on things like infrastructure development or welfare distribution—they have done much better. People are increasingly ready to vote above caste lines and against dynasts, in favour of the actual work they do.",
        "Most of these parties are run by egotistical people who care more about being in power than the welfare of people. A coalition comprising of too many parties will never be supported by Indian public. \n\nWhy? These coalitions are unstable. They may not have a unified ideology, they will very likely not function very well as a cohesive unit. Who will lead such a coalition? Its tough, they will have to manage the interest of many different parties, even compromise at times.\n\nIt will also lack the decisiveness needed to make tough decisions and bring reforms. Will everyone in the coalition agree to vote on the same law? I wonder. Is it good/bad? Both ways is possible but personally I believe this can have adverse effect on bringing legislations into existence quickly as it will keep things going in circles forever. \n\nIndia really needs a stable govt right now to support its global aspirations, a coalition govt may not inspire same trust in global investors or our allies. \n\nSo many different factors. I hope for INC to someday recover their power and reform to come out as a better party and take down BJP when anti-incumbency is at its peak. It will be better than a coalition govt. \n\nI dont feel an ounce of confidence in them presently though. What even is their vision for the country? The leaders that drove the party into the ground are still running the show. Chidambaram? He made fun of digital banking in rural india, this guy was our FM? India is a fintech leader in the world now. We don't need idiots like these, we need people like Manmohan Singh and Narsimha Rao who had a vision to reform and develop the country. INC is not in that position now. Rahul Gandhi showed progress with Bharat Jodo Yatra but I am disappointed that the party has not changed at all despite everything.",
        "You forgot to mention TMC lol. Mamta Banerjee and Nitish Kumar are similar in this regard. They hold delusions of becoming PM. Bihar under Nitish has remained backward while hes been in power since forever. WB was in a bad shape since the communist days and maybe TMC was better but even WB has shown no progress in last 2 decades. The incident of Tata Nano factory is still fresh in my mind.",
        "You can say this at a state level. We managed to do it in Karnataka. INC won. BJP lost badly. Half of BJP's cabinet ministers lost elections and this was testament of how much the people here despised the BJP Govt.\n\nBut you think a general election can be won that easily? Look at AAP and the pattern of voting between Assembly elections and General Elections. You'll see how people have different ideals when it comes go Central Govt. They want a stable and cohesive party with a strong leader and a strong vision. Congress needs to prove itself by doing good work in the states it has, see the infighting in Rajasthan. Does this inspire confidence in central leadership of INC? They cant even manage their own leaders.",
        "I wonder where people get such delusions. He could not even win the Presidential election of the party. I am not questioning his ability I am merely pointing out that he has a particular image that is not pan-national.",
        "Delhi model? Kerala model?",
        "Wow, are we now supporting such an alliance just because of anti-incumbent sentiments? What a stupid thing to do.",
        "A lot of the coalition is essentially what UPA 1 and 2 were about. A situation where Congress has 125-150 and BJP has 200-225, leaves the field wide open for enough alliances to run the government. \n\nIt's not as if 10 years of a government that can do much has benefitted the people of this country very much.",
        "Those aren't congress ruled states.",
        "True. The reason I didn’t mention TMC was - I truly am not sure whether what I see as lack of ‘progress’ is seen the same way by people of WB. I sometimes suspect they are okay with the state of WB.",
        "WB sees huge migration of labourers to other states. If you have to leave your home state to do physical labourer in other states thousands of miles away then it says a lot about the conditions of your state. Don't you think?\n\nWB is being increasingly compared with Bihar for this reason.",

        "I see Rahul gandhi's defeat more as hindutvas victory rather people throwing dynasty away. If it were genuinely ppl getting more mature and rejecting dynasty politics, i would be all in on it, but i dont think thats whats happening.",
        "As a Keralite, I hope our model is not used. \n\nThe economy relies heavily on Alcohol and lottery. There are almost no top colleges here. Quality of life and good socio-economic factors are the only things that should be emulated from Kerala."

They just have different preferences on what they consider productive work that is valuable for them. I wouldn't think the current government has done any worse on things like infrastructure development or welfare distribution—they have done much better. People are increasingly ready to vote above caste lines and against dynasts, in favour of the actual work they do. Most of these parties are run by egotistical people who care more about being in power than the welfare of people. A coalition comprising of too many parties will never be supported by Indian public. Why? These coalitions are unstable. They may not have a unified ideology, they will very likely not function very well as a cohesive unit. Who will lead such a coalition? Its tough, they will have to manage the interest of many different parties, even compromise at times. It will also lack the decisiveness needed to make tough decisions and bring reforms. Will everyone in the coalition agree to vote on the same law? I wonder. Is it good/bad? Both ways is possible but personally I believe this can have adverse effect on bringing legislations into existence quickly as it will keep things going in circles forever. India really needs a stable govt right now to support its global aspirations, a coalition govt may not inspire same trust in global investors or our allies. So many different factors. I hope for INC to someday recover their power and reform to come out as a better party and take down BJP when anti-incumbency is at its peak. It will be better than a coalition govt. I dont feel an ounce of confidence in them presently though. What even is their vision for the country? The leaders that drove the party into the ground are still running the show. Chidambaram? He made fun of digital banking in rural india, this guy was our FM? India is a fintech leader in the world now. We don't need idiots like these, we need people like Manmohan Singh and Narsimha Rao who had a vision to reform and develop the country. INC is not in that position now. Rahul Gandhi showed progress with Bharat Jodo Yatra but I am disappointed that the party has not changed at all despite everything. You forgot to mention TMC lol. Mamta Banerjee and Nitish Kumar are similar in this regard. They hold delusions of becoming PM. Bihar under Nitish has remained backward while hes been in power since forever. WB was in a bad shape since the communist days and maybe TMC was better but even WB has shown no progress in last 2 decades. The incident of Tata Nano factory is still fresh in my mind. You can say this at a state level. We managed to do it in Karnataka. INC won. BJP lost badly. Half of BJP's cabinet ministers lost elections and this was testament of how much the people here despised the BJP Govt. But you think a general election can be won that easily? Look at AAP and the pattern of voting between Assembly elections and General Elections. You'll see how people have different ideals when it comes go Central Govt. They want a stable and cohesive party with a strong leader and a strong vision. Congress needs to prove itself by doing good work in the states it has, see the infighting in Rajasthan. Does this inspire confidence in central leadership of INC? They cant even manage their own leaders. I wonder where people get such delusions. He could not even win the Presidential election of the party. I am not questioning his ability I am merely pointing out that he has a particular image that is not pan-national. Delhi model? Kerala model? Wow, are we now supporting such an alliance just because of anti-incumbent sentiments? What a stupid thing to do. A lot of the coalition is essentially what UPA 1 and 2 were about. A situation where Congress has 125-150 and BJP has 200-225, leaves the field wide open for enough alliances to run the government. It's not as if 10 years of a government that can do much has benefitted the people of this country very much. Those aren't congress ruled states. True. The reason I didn’t mention TMC was - I truly am not sure whether what I see as lack of ‘progress’ is seen the same way by people of WB. I sometimes suspect they are okay with the state of WB. WB sees huge migration of labourers to other states. If you have to leave your home state to do physical labourer in other states thousands of miles away then it says a lot about the conditions of your state. Don't you think? WB is being increasingly compared with Bihar for this reason. This is really old data. It is probably only higher now. I see Rahul gandhi's defeat more as hindutvas victory rather people throwing dynasty away. If it were genuinely ppl getting more mature and rejecting dynasty politics, i would be all in on it, but i dont think thats whats happening. As a Keralite, I hope our model is not used. The economy relies heavily on Alcohol and lottery. There are almost no top colleges here. Quality of life and good socio-economic factors are the only things that should be emulated from Kerala."
