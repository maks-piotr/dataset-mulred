The taste was horribly bitter. I wonder what the restaurant actually cooked and zomato delivered. Explained it to zomato cc in their chat support, that was of no help. Then emailed to zomato support and see what they replied:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l97xp8mmckcb1.jpeg?width=1438&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=186eec00e2c9ea756126ef7c3f53cf7bc63c9ab9",

I have tried this technique with multiple companies and they always provide you with a good resolution. Also remember to tell chatgpt to write the legal notice using provisions from Sale of goods act and consumer protection act.",
        "No I did not actually...\nDirectly, you mean?",
        "That pizza looks like it was taken out of a trashcan. If I were you I would go straight up to that restaurant and speak to the manager politely. He will definitely do something about it and offer compensation.",

You are basically handling their ass on public conversations like those on twitter.",
        "As a restaurant owner, I'd say this one is on the restaurant. You should call them and register a complaint with the manager. Zomato has little power over this situation.\n\nWhen you register a complaint on Zomato/Swiggy it is immediately forwarded to the restaurant, where the restaurant is given multiple options for refunding. For example: 50% refund, 25% refund, 0% refund.\n\nIf the restaurant chooses 0% then zomato cannot help you other than what little ~Rs.80 worth refund that they can provide.",
        "Damn this was a helpful tip...\nAny other quick tips like the \"sales of goods act and consumer protection act\"?\nIs there a quick video on how to get something like this out of chatGPT?",
        "Yup. Do the complaint and email the ticket number to Zomato with screenshots and bill invoice. The \"Koe nahi, chalta hai\" attitude needs to change. \n\nMention name of employees, The delivery guy, hotel name, The manager of hotel, you can call and ask regarding the manager. \n\nYou can always try multiple ways.",

        "FUCK ZOMATO !!!!",
        "Please enlighten me then how is this Zomato’s fault?? Is the rider supposed to open every item and check before delivering it?? Is Zomato supposed to keep a supervisor in the kitchen of all the restaurants that are on its platform??\n\nI might be an uneducated consumer. But i can at least google (a skill you seem to lack). And a simple google search will lead you to the result that Zomato is not responsible for the errors of the restaurant. The same is clearly mentioned in their terms of use. \n\n“Zomato shall not be liable for any acts or omissions on part of the Restaurant Partner/Store(s) including deficiency in service, wrong delivery of order / order mismatch, quality, incorrect pricing, deficient quantity, time taken to prepare or deliver the order, etc.”",
        "I'll try this...it's a cloud kitchen unfortunately...\nBut what all information will I require...\nWill the details on Zomato do?\nWill that be enough to have everything to lodge a complaint directly?",
        "Try and order directly from the restaurant, you get a better response and service, plus Zomato takes away a minimum 30 percent revenue share from all orders. So they’ve pocketed theirs, you are left hungry, and the restaurant will also receive their money after all deductions",
        "My point is proven",
        "The silver linings...\nThe good in the bad...\nThe positive outlook...\nThe happier and greener side of things...\nI am sorry to hear about your acidity issues and liver problems though... I'll hope there is some way for you to recover back to your former glory!",
        "Not having a booking is completely different from what happened here. The hotel clearly got the booking (using your example), but the hotel quality  was lacking. In which case it is not MMTs fault. Especially not when you consider that this particular hotel had plenty of 1 star reviews that you chose to ignore when you booked it.",
        "Depends on where you order from",
        "No worries 😇",
        "Dude listen to me, just file a complaint on the national consumer helpline app. I've just stopped bothering talking to these customer care assholes altogether. It's not worth your time. Ask them once. If they refuse, just go directly to the NCH app, file a complaint over there and watch these companies lose their shit. You'll be getting a call back with an apology and a refund soon.",

        "The pain... ;_;\nOhh the tragic loss.\nThis actually helps...maybe I'll stay away from fast food for a while...save some money and keep in good health.",
        "Zomato is completely a bitch. I'm sorry about your loss man, I didn't suffer as much as you did. But these fuckers stole from me as well and didn't pay back at all, no matter how much I tried. They were giving the Gold offer for 199 for 3 months. Sounded like a great deal since my friend also have a Zomato gold and it saved him a ton. So as I clicked on the payment option, I paid by Paytm, money was deducted from my account and then the app showed me \"Error in servers, we'll try again later\" and then I never got my subscription, neither my money. These fuckers don't have call customer support, they refer us to their website, I dropped 3 requests and submitted my issue thrice, did not get any reply back. I then specifically made a twitter account to message them on twitter, they replied we'll get back to you as soon as we can and then never replied. I even tweeted by tagging them, still no reply. It's not even about 200 rupees anymore, it's about fucking professionalism bro. Never ordered from Zomato since then",
        "From your name, they figured out that bacon and pepperoni are not allowed for you. Nice try, OP.",
        "Yes. Tag @zomatocare and @nch1915. Mention your order id and post pics/chat transcript like you did here. \n\nSomeone from their social media team will be calling you soon",

        "God bless you man..\nThanks for taking the time and replying.\nIs time of the essence? Like will it lose impact if I wait a day or 2 and then do it? \nThoda executive dysfunction sa hai...need to accumulate those points to spend them",
        "Share a sound review on google maps too",
        "Please feel free.\nI'm happy just to have their names dragged through the mud a bit.\nJust want them to feel like they need to be careful and subservient of the huge base of people who have given them their business and trust.",

I would have fu*ked the sh*t out of everyone connected to this order. I hope you get justice. Fight harder my friend. Also, let me know if I can somehow help you.",
        "It is ideal to contact them asap. Waiting even 5-6 hours dampens the impact. They will question your motive for late complaint. If you wait a day or two, consider the case gone. Just copy-paste your rant from here to Twitter, tag and post. But if it's not worth your time or is anxiety inducing, uninstall Zomato for good and that will be the end of it.",

Lol.\nYour anger helps me calm mine...my vent feels successful.\nThank you for empathising.\nI will fight...there have been some very informative and helpful comments here...but I'll do it over a week. Can't accumulate that much energy to do it all today. It feels like a lot.",
        "I hate that you're right :(.   Waiting would be detrimental...and wohi...thoda anxiety sa hai...but I'll still do it in a day or two AND also follow your other advice of uninstalling the app.\nIt will feel like a small victory to me",

        "Yeah that's more than enough\n\nIt totally depends on their manager tho. If he's any good at his job he might provide you some kind of reimbursement, could be a refund, or voucher, etc.",

        "There were good before but then since they got listed and started doing this shitty things and now their stocks are rallying . Once they provided me food without any salts and when I asked for a refund they provided me rs10 for salt and the whole taste was ruined. Their motto has become that we are just delivery service and are not responsible for the food mishaps done by the restaurant. But before when then had just started they were taking responsibility of restaurants too.",

In the last picture you can see that there's literally no bacon(default item), no mushroom and no extra pepperoni. Each add-on was 80 bucks and Zomato literally thought that an amount less than that would be a fair compensation. Smh. I left the restaurant/dine-out a scathing review...

Trust me. Atleast try. Don't give up before even fighting it out. Is that kaali mirch lmao It's in the first picture \"Francesco's pizzeria\" I haven’t been to India for 4 years now. Is that what 1,200 gets you these days!? That’s more expensive than US and Canada. Bahar ja k kha le idhar kya tantrum dikha raha hai. Ghar pe khana bhi chahie aur delivery fee se bhi problem hai. Leave pizza, daal chawal khao, thoda dimag aaega I checked their review, 39 reviews and all top ones are 1 star. Its kinda your fault too. I always check review before ordering. Open the ticket again and tell them you've received a wrong product. Write now, you're going for items missing. Tell them that the entire order is wrong and that you can't consume it. Worth a try I wanted to try a new place...kinda live in the outskirts of Gurgaon...not too ripe with options. But yeah...I'll keep that in mind. I was kinda hoping to shit on Zomato...so if you could join in on that, I'd be happy. I'll give it a try I don't think its Zomato's fault though because its not their restaurant. But I stopped using them after a similar experience. Swiggy has a way better customer service. They have given me refunds multiple time. It's not their(Zomato's) fault that the order was wrong, incomplete and subpar...but the way they handled customer service was inadequate. Thanks man...I might make the switch to swiggy too Watch a vid released yesterday by the first post channel on Indian unicorns. They're all as you said, Bitches. Exploitation at it's peak through aggresive and unacceptable methods. Depends from city to city... Most places in Gurgaon though, are not worth the price... Infact there were some good ones that have gone down the drain in about a years time...idk if they changed chefs/cooks...but it's sad Can't wait for a French-style revolution where the rich and powerful shudder and lose sleep over how their chickens have come home to roost/over reaping what they've sown. When people unite and fight the true villains...the uber and ultra wealthy. OP that doesn't even look like pizza! Aise hi aya tha kya? Why are you even arguing that something is missing? I will just that they didn't deliver what you ordered. Refund the whole price. Zomato takes 20% from restaurants + from customers. It should atleast be getting the orders correct. You should ask to send to her manager. And on twitter, tag zomato, along with newspaper and customer court. Not worth a third of 1200 tbh Not CCs fault tho, poor policy and resolution handling last year I ordered sweets and they were spoiled, posted on their twitter and they replied 4 days later saying they will look into it after that they said will return the order value as zomato credits in 24 hours Well it didn’t happen. After a week or so again contacted them and then a week later it was credited to my account. Their Resolution time frame sucks, Swiggy on the other hand is really fast about this stuff. I wish I could do the Twitter thing... My twitter account is basically a bot account... I have only bot followers and I myself have followed Asus, nvidia and some other PC gaming handles to enter some free giveaways...I basically created the account for it and have left it like that ever since. I don't blame the cc either...they probably have a limited script and options to divulge into. I'm just mad at Zomato...this is helping me get rid of the rage. Yeah, I got another comment mentioning how swiggy is better at this stuff... I'm definitely making the switch You said it man... It truly was not Attack the D Point Omg...a warthunder fan? :-O WHAT I dont get it. How is this Zomatos fault?? They just deliver the pizza. Its the restaurant that makes it. I wish they'd compensate me better than Rs. 75 That's what I'm mad about...each add-on was Rs. 80...and none of those add-ons were provided. It didn't even have one of the default ingredients (bacon) Speak to the customer support again. Close the chat and start again. Sometimes it works. This happened to me once. I closed the chat and started a chat again. They gave me a better discount. Different executives deal with matters differently. I'll give it a shot! Same happened to me. Switched to Swiggy You my friend, are an average uneducated consumer, who will be taken for a ride his entire life, by cheating companies, because your consumer awareness is non-existent Imagine you plan a vacation in some remote part of India and book a hotel through mmt. On reaching there the hotel tells you, they don't have any booking. Who would you blame ? Would you not blame mmt coz they just did your booking? Same thing here I literally got 2 more comments telling me the same thing... I am more than convinced...Zomato can kiss my ass. Swiggy, here I come! swiggy customer care sucks too. last week at night 10 the driver was going in opposite direction from restaurant. it's clear he won't be picking up the order. i called him but he didn't lift the call. opened customer care and it took 5 mins to connect to one guy, he says wait I'll contact the guy and then days he's not lifting the call saar. i was like it's clear he won't pick it up, just assign another driver asap so that my order will be delivered in given time frame. but no , it takes almost 45 mins for them to change the driver and by then I'm no longer hungry Next time i order from zomato, i will make sure to check and read reviews, visit the linkedin profile of the owner and do a background verification on him. Okay...now I'm slightly conflicted... Besides that terrible event, have there been any other instances where swiggy has let you down? If you have an oven, you can make the pizza you ordered yourself and it doesn’t even take too much time. Pizzas are about assembling the components (all of which are available for instant delivery). I started making pizzas but without the base- in a glass (oven-friendly) container, add cheese, toppings, cold cuts and bacon, put into oven on the highest setting Aur khao suar Similar thing happened when I ordered the mojo half-half pizza, one half was supposed to be paneer tikka and the other half Mexican something, but got the same pizza on both halves do you guys order one Rs1100 worth of pizza from a 3.8star restaurant? [https://www.zomato.com/ncr/francescos-pizzeria-sector-49-gurgaon](https://www.zomato.com/ncr/francescos-pizzeria-sector-49-gurgaon) Bro Zomato is fucked up kaafi big now. I switched to Swiggy atleast unka customer care understands and do the right thing now. Arey suar nahi mila...isilye toh dukhi hoon... I wanted that juicy/fatty and crispy bacon. I'm definitely switching to swiggy...4 comments here have now mentioned the same thing...how swiggy is better than Zomato in this regard. Op what did you mention as the main reason? Aren't you precious Haan bro. Mere saath bhi same hua last month aisehi Zomato ne kata tha mera bhi. Tabse Swiggy switch karliya, and you can also try Eatsure. Select missing items and then continue they usually take it more seriously on top if that always ask for money in you zomato wallet and don't allow them to give you coupon Send them a legal notice Items are missing/incorrect order Eatsure kaisa hai? Usme options kaise hai? Thoda outskirts me rehta hoon.. Bro Eatsure is pretty good. Options bhi bohot h. Basically unka khud ka cloud kitchen h toh selected brands honge but you'll get everything from Biryani to Rolls to Cheesecake to Ice cream. Delivery ka bhi sorted h all over India h. Maine Bangalore me bhi try Kara h, Mumbai too and Delhi GGN toh obviously. Try karlo acha h. Quality bhi achi h. I wish...I neither have the energy, time, will, resources or mental/intellectual competence to follow through with that Dude, first things first TWEET IT. It Does work. But tweet against the resturant or the place you ordered from... Zomato just delivers, right? Complain against the supplier (resturant). I got full free meal from McDonald by the Tweet just for poor service. Give the context to chatgpt and tell it to write a legal notice. Send the legal notice chat gpt wrote to zomato email. Stop bitching about your Twitter account being less than par, just make the same post there and share the link. We'll like and retweet, don't worry. I would have asked the chat associate escalate and to speak to a manager. Sometimes the person you are speaking to might either be incompetent or unable to do more than that at that level Did you try contacting the restaurant? Tweet against them mainly... It sure helps even when you got no followers. Like I got free meal from MacD just for the complaint for poor service. \"meet me at consumer court uwu\" Thanks Bhai 🙏 I'll definitely give it a shot Not really. What you get for 1200 totally depends on the restaurant you're ordering from. That's...that's actually not too bad..xD Zomato after sales service is a scam. Let me explain my latest experience: Ordered a dish named \"crispy mushroom babycorn\" and the dish was anything but mushroom or corn. The taste was horribly bitter. I wonder what the restaurant actually cooked and zomato delivered. Explained it to zomato cc in their chat support, that was of no help. Then emailed to zomato support and see what they replied: National Consumer Helpline mobile Application I probably should have tried that...for now I'm just going to shift to swiggy and try out eatsure, from the suggestions here Yeah. Zomato messed up my order about a month ago. I tried the same technique and got a full refund. I have tried this technique with multiple companies and they always provide you with a good resolution. Also remember to tell chatgpt to write the legal notice using provisions from Sale of goods act and consumer protection act. No I did not actually... Directly, you mean? That pizza looks like it was taken out of a trashcan. If I were you I would go straight up to that restaurant and speak to the manager politely. He will definitely do something about it and offer compensation. Do they take complaints for these small amounts and petty issues? As in...do they take it seriously and work on it proactively? Unfortunately, it's a cloud kitchen ;_; I thought it was another idiot complaining about prices. But here, the company is the one to break the contract. Post it on twitter. These companies act like huge bitches when questioned in public, they also have an obligation to have the last reply in the a public chat. You are basically handling their ass on public conversations like those on twitter. As a restaurant owner, I'd say this one is on the restaurant. You should call them and register a complaint with the manager. Zomato has little power over this situation. When you register a complaint on Zomato/Swiggy it is immediately forwarded to the restaurant, where the restaurant is given multiple options for refunding. For example: 50% refund, 25% refund, 0% refund. If the restaurant chooses 0% then zomato cannot help you other than what little ~Rs.80 worth refund that they can provide. Damn this was a helpful tip... Any other quick tips like the \"sales of goods act and consumer protection act\"? Is there a quick video on how to get something like this out of chatGPT? Yup. Do the complaint and email the ticket number to Zomato with screenshots and bill invoice. The \"Koe nahi, chalta hai\" attitude needs to change. Mention name of employees, The delivery guy, hotel name, The manager of hotel, you can call and ask regarding the manager. You can always try multiple ways. It's good thing that I ate and drank like a pig in June and now I have high uric acid and bad liver enzymes, so I have to quit all junk and alcohol or else I would also have to go through the ordeal of dealing with the CC of Zomato and Swiggy. please allow me a moment FUCK ZOMATO !!!! Please enlighten me then how is this Zomato’s fault?? Is the rider supposed to open every item and check before delivering it?? Is Zomato supposed to keep a supervisor in the kitchen of all the restaurants that are on its platform?? I might be an uneducated consumer. But i can at least google (a skill you seem to lack). And a simple google search will lead you to the result that Zomato is not responsible for the errors of the restaurant. The same is clearly mentioned in their terms of use. “Zomato shall not be liable for any acts or omissions on part of the Restaurant Partner/Store(s) including deficiency in service, wrong delivery of order / order mismatch, quality, incorrect pricing, deficient quantity, time taken to prepare or deliver the order, etc.” I'll try this...it's a cloud kitchen unfortunately... But what all information will I require... Will the details on Zomato do? Will that be enough to have everything to lodge a complaint directly? Try and order directly from the restaurant, you get a better response and service, plus Zomato takes away a minimum 30 percent revenue share from all orders. So they’ve pocketed theirs, you are left hungry, and the restaurant will also receive their money after all deductions My point is proven The silver linings... The good in the bad... The positive outlook... The happier and greener side of things... I am sorry to hear about your acidity issues and liver problems though... I'll hope there is some way for you to recover back to your former glory! Not having a booking is completely different from what happened here. The hotel clearly got the booking (using your example), but the hotel quality was lacking. In which case it is not MMTs fault. Especially not when you consider that this particular hotel had plenty of 1 star reviews that you chose to ignore when you booked it. Depends on where you order from No worries 😇 Dude listen to me, just file a complaint on the national consumer helpline app. I've just stopped bothering talking to these customer care assholes altogether. It's not worth your time. Ask them once. If they refuse, just go directly to the NCH app, file a complaint over there and watch these companies lose their shit. You'll be getting a call back with an apology and a refund soon. YES THANK YOU...This makes me feel so much better... Genuinely...quells my rage. This is a tip I'll keep in mind. I only wish some of them weren't picky about delivering over 10kms... especially the guys with the tasty food ;_; But I get it...I do stay a bit towards the outskirts Zomato is shite now. It's better to go out and buy directly. Paise b bachengey... I love the idea of them calling back :') It would feel like justice Yehi best hai...it's just...thoda door rehta hoon sab cheezo se... A bit towards the outskirts/industrial area. The pertinent question is, Mr Nisar, why are you eating bacon? Having a beer too, eh?🤣🤣🤣 Dude just post in on twitter. Zomato doesn't care about your followers. Remove any identifiable information and post the link here, we'll retweet/like. please allow me a moment This guy is crazy rich dude, may be earing multiple lakhs per month, otherwise Domino's 500rs is overkill for 1 person. Pepperoni in India? What does it taste like? Actual pork? Maaan I'm not a believer of any religion that currently exists on earth(not that I've done some deep digging) But I kinda believe this itself is heaven...being born...the infinitesimal chances of even getting to experience life itself is a gift...so I'm not going to stop myself from enjoying food and drinks at the very least. That pizza looks like something you will get in a small cafe for 250, why tf it's 1200 rs lol. I have eaten better looking pizza for like 300 Alright man...I'll definitely give it a try... So just tag them basically? And add the pictures as proof? I've not had too much pepperoni...but the tastiest one that I can remember is from Nomad Pizza... They're actually pretty good...they've gotten worse from when I first tried them... But they're still better than most. Monkeys can be trained better than these so called customer care The pain... ;_; Ohh the tragic loss. This actually helps...maybe I'll stay away from fast food for a while...save some money and keep in good health. Zomato is completely a bitch. I'm sorry about your loss man, I didn't suffer as much as you did. But these fuckers stole from me as well and didn't pay back at all, no matter how much I tried. They were giving the Gold offer for 199 for 3 months. Sounded like a great deal since my friend also have a Zomato gold and it saved him a ton. So as I clicked on the payment option, I paid by Paytm, money was deducted from my account and then the app showed me \"Error in servers, we'll try again later\" and then I never got my subscription, neither my money. These fuckers don't have call customer support, they refer us to their website, I dropped 3 requests and submitted my issue thrice, did not get any reply back. I then specifically made a twitter account to message them on twitter, they replied we'll get back to you as soon as we can and then never replied. I even tweeted by tagging them, still no reply. It's not even about 200 rupees anymore, it's about fucking professionalism bro. Never ordered from Zomato since then From your name, they figured out that bacon and pepperoni are not allowed for you. Nice try, OP. Yes. Tag @zomatocare and @nch1915. Mention your order id and post pics/chat transcript like you did here. Someone from their social media team will be calling you soon It's events like this that really put you off from brands like these. Thanks for sharing man...it helps me feel a little better... I'm sorry you had to go through something like that...And you're right... that's what truly hurts...the lack of professionalism even after being a mogul. I don't wanna see/order from Zomato for a long time now. Curse religion/societal shackles and their invisible boundaries of taboo that must never be crossed. Khana hai yarr ;_; Lemme eat aaram se. I'm not forcing anyone else neither am I tempting anyone else nor am I stopping anyone else... I'm just being selfish here...bas MUJHE chahiye. I don't represent anyone else but my own stomach and my own needs. Damn OP that’s sad. Should I post it on twitter on your behalf? Bro don't do anything, I hold shares in zomato /s God bless you man.. Thanks for taking the time and replying. Is time of the essence? Like will it lose impact if I wait a day or 2 and then do it? Thoda executive dysfunction sa hai...need to accumulate those points to spend them Share a sound review on google maps too Please feel free. I'm happy just to have their names dragged through the mud a bit. Just want them to feel like they need to be careful and subservient of the huge base of people who have given them their business and trust. XD This actually made me chuckle...and feel better. Thanks man This reply have my respect 🫡 I wish we had more people like OP in this country. Bro if I am buying a 10 inch pizza for 1200. I want someone to come and feed me. Here it seems that they haven’t even delivered what was expected. I am not able to keep my calm. I would have fu*ked the sh*t out of everyone connected to this order. I hope you get justice. Fight harder my friend. Also, let me know if I can somehow help you. It is ideal to contact them asap. Waiting even 5-6 hours dampens the impact. They will question your motive for late complaint. If you wait a day or two, consider the case gone. Just copy-paste your rant from here to Twitter, tag and post. But if it's not worth your time or is anxiety inducing, uninstall Zomato for good and that will be the end of it. Email them. They listen better. I loved the imagery of someone feeding me pizza, Greece/Roman-grape style. Lol. Your anger helps me calm mine...my vent feels successful. Thank you for empathising. I will fight...there have been some very informative and helpful comments here...but I'll do it over a week. Can't accumulate that much energy to do it all today. It feels like a lot. I hate that you're right :(. Waiting would be detrimental...and wohi...thoda anxiety sa hai...but I'll still do it in a day or two AND also follow your other advice of uninstalling the app. It will feel like a small victory to me Even Deepshikha got you too deep bro. Fuck Zomato and Swiggy. Take it to twitter and tag every fuckin human being on this planet Yeah that's more than enough It totally depends on their manager tho. If he's any good at his job he might provide you some kind of reimbursement, could be a refund, or voucher, etc. XD She did man...she did. I don't blame her...but I am pissed at the higher ups at Zomato...the ones who formulated/passed these half-assed tries. I wish I had a proper working twitter... True yaar. If it doesn't kill you and tastes good, eat it. That's all. I’ve found Swiggy to be a bit more tolerable than zomato. I am sorry this happened to you. I can understand your pain. Thank you man...your empathy helps...like a lot. I feel calmer. Good Pep & Bacon pizzas are rare and he also added 3 extra toppings of pep, mushroom and chicken. Swiggy is great in customer support, i ordered a cake and it was wrong in color they gave me a full refund. And one time the pizza was cold They gave me an 80% amount coupon. Goddamn O.o Swiggy, here I come! A lot of people here have given me the same advice...plus one person mentioned eatsure also being decent. Been having problems with zomato/swiggy myself. We expect the deliver boys to mess up but unfortunately even the restaurants can’t be fully trusted nowadays. Zomato is cheaper most of the times, but i find swiggy more “sane” so to speak. Also, order directly from the restaurant websites or dot.pe where ever possible. I’ve tried Thrive, they’re service isn’t up to the mark yet. Glad to know I'm not alone in missing orders and feeling low about it. There were good before but then since they got listed and started doing this shitty things and now their stocks are rallying . Once they provided me food without any salts and when I asked for a refund they provided me rs10 for salt and the whole taste was ruined. Their motto has become that we are just delivery service and are not responsible for the food mishaps done by the restaurant. But before when then had just started they were taking responsibility of restaurants too. That's sound advice. I'll definitely check out if more places are willing to directly deliver. Gonna accumulate some good ol numbers It's fine to eat fast food occasionally bruv but I think nowadays fast food has become shit expensive, fucking 1200 rs for a dry ass looking pizza lol. r/pizzacrimes Tweet. I got full refund. *sad hug* *Pats back* there there... we're in this together...and that makes it better/easier That's what I was gonna ask, should've tried to reach out to the restaurant's direct contact. Generally, they do listen. A swiggy member here, I have swiggy and my wife has Zomato. (Bangalore). Swiggy sometimes scresd my order so many times that I am planning to cancel the subscription in couple of months. No delivery service is good and I try my best to dine out than order in now. BC 1200 ka pizza? I have to save for a week to have one dominos regular cheese burst Sorry i am late to reply but try contacting Francesco pizzeria, in most cases the restaurant will itself provide replacement or give you the refund WTF IS THIS REAL? Did they really pull the \"here's 10 bucks for salt, bitch\" ? That's quite insulting, if anything. It feels sad to see the greats fall...they get too comfortable and complacent and money/profits become the number 1 priority I think the best option is to just order from the restaurant directly. Yes do it op I will send it to my friends to tweet It really is quite shit looking, isn't it xD Definitely wasn't worth it. r/subsithoughtifellfor I'll give it a shot...it's late today...but let's hope they're nice enough to understand and listen tomorrow. Maybe I'll go over there That probably tastes better than what I had...maybe not by much...but better. And the price difference really drives it home. Bacon is haraam bro I think that is something I'll definitely try...a few others have suggested the same... If I have time, I might go directly to their kitchen tomorrow... hopefully they're understanding I'm not really a believer. Thoda non-conformist sa hoon iss regard me... I'm open to the belief that there is something crazy powerful/divine out there...but I don't follow/agree with any religion on earth... Science and knowledge is the closest thing to understanding and unraveling the micro and macro worlds...so I'll stick to that as a holy book. That pizza looks like shit and not because its missing a few toppings. You can tweet with a fresh new account, no need for followers. Just tag zomato. Nisar and bacon? Astagfirullah. You deserve it /s Just kidding. Shame them on social media. Or tell them you're going to spread rumors that it's beef pepperoni that they are serving lol. For me Swiggy is a BITCH Zomatos priority is just money now cause many many people have gotten dependent on them. > Mr never assume ;) Try 'wrong order' option..have always received a full refund even when restaurants just missed an egg in my biryani. The restaurant's page shows an egg with the biryani so they have to give it. LOL, I ordered from KFC for the exact reason. They changed 1 item and left out 2 items from family meal. Their customer service is useless even after calling multiple people. At least you get some refund from Swiggy/Zomato. Share Twitter link bro Try LinkedIn once, that can be helpful Literally ordering 1200₹ pizza, bhaiya YOU are the rich 😭 There’s a reason I use a credit card in the US for shit like this. Can always dispute a charge with the card company. I have zero faith in these stupid fucked up customer support policies and behaviours. Zomato and Swiggy are equally disgusting. Zomato more so, specifically. I worked for that company for 3 years and they’ve got nothing as ethics. Happened with me too... received a stale milkshake and just Rs. 75 refund. Even after escalation to email. Tell them you received something that goes against your religious beliefs. True. Always use credit card for any investor led startup service, they have zero control over quality and vendor actually hate them for taking huge commissions so even vendor don’t cooperate with these apps. I haven’t ordered anything in india yet, but i did same when i was in US, always use CC. Free ki tip , pizza waise hi sada hua lag raha hai , complain kar do respective department me ki ye pizza kha ke food poisoning huyi and zomato didn’t take any responsibility. Dono jaayenge ek saath. Food is cheaper if we can go buy it ourselves. Zomato already inflates the prices and also the bigger thief (government) takes away more money I am confused about the savings part. How did they add upto 239? Am I missing something? They're all the same, sorry. Fucking hell this looks like a £6 pizza from the shitty takeaway round the corner from me. For £12 I could get a really nice meaty pizza from Franco Manca, one of the best chains around here. Delivered to my door for another £5. This is central London, UK. £11 = Rs. 1200. Ask for refund plain and simple, you are a consumer and have complete rights to the item detailed in the menu. Second advice would be to order something which you can pay two times over. if you aren`t okay with a pizza not as per your expectation for INR 1100 you wouldn`t be okay with it if it had been for INR 550. Not to compare or anything but one time Uber eats didn't deliver my order. They refunded me and the next day delivered me a gift pack full of snacks to make up for it. Ig Zomato can only acquire companies with money not competency. Did it work? If possible, please go to this tweet and engage with it so that they'd be forced to reply and take action regarding it. My money was taken on 29th June. It's about to be a month."
