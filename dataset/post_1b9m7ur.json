    "selftext": "I was watching India - England Test match on JioCinema and was appalled by the kind of personal questions that were prompted again and again while watching the videos. Many of these questions have nothing to do with the experience app (e.g. \"Do you have a vehicle?\" Or \"What is your educational qualification?\"). All digital companies collect data about their customers, but generally the data is limited to what is directly required by the service, and never I have been asked of such personal information.\n\nFrom the corporations perspective, it is clearly for creating a profile of the user and this information will be used for customized targeting of users on other Jio businesses (e.g. JioMart). Most people don't even understand how this collected data will affect them, so let me explain.\n\nSome ways in which other Jio businesses (e.g. JioMart) can use this information is : \n\n- Differential pricing of products or discounts : Type of vehicle (4/2 wheeler) is a good indicator of the level of income of a person. So a wealtheir person can be given less discounts.\n\n- Recommendations : The landing page of JioMart can be customised to show more expensive / higher margin products first if you fall in the high income category.\n\nAnd many more. So think twice before sharing your personal information with such companies.",
