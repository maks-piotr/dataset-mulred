Because ironically when we were together she once chose a shirt and jeans for me that matches exactly to yours in the song cover.. It was not just a coincidence but a manifestation for me.. And your lyrics and melody of the song made me want to fight the physical and mental pain i was going through.. So on her birthday during durga puja.. I took the first bus and reached out to her in that same pink shirt and those same jeans and we met for the first time.. And to update.. Three years later..

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "EDIT : Hey guys! This has been so much fun! I'll keep answering questions whenever I can. Just gonna have dinner now heh x",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "how did you get the inspiration for your song lyrics? was it based off your past relationships or something? your lyrics are absolutely beautiful and keep doing what you do we love it ‚ù§Ô∏è Is your music in SoundCloud When will u perform in Delhi next? Do you listen to rap music?? Who are your favourite rap artist,indian(not allowed to say yashraj) and international will you make a part 2 for Gul, really want the broken house to be fixed Have you really been through so many relationship issues in life or are these stories just a culmination of various situations you have come across as a third party? Also do you think you would've been able to write such deep songs if not for these experiences/situations? I came to Mumbai last September at AAM, met Aayushman, unfortunately didn't send my demos to him back then although he asked me to (would be solid if you told him another kid like you wants to send him music). Learnt a lot about the music industry at the conference. Went home, made some music. Been documenting my journey on videos since then. Came back this Jan, enrolled in a music institute, I'm currently recording my music. I don't know how to get shows and my songs are going to release by the end of this year, what steps should I be taking next as an independent artist to make sure I get the outreach for my music? How does negative feedback make you feel about your music? How do you go about choosing an artwork for your song covers? Hey anuv , loved your new song . What are some challenges you faced while navigating in the music industry? where do you get your inspirations for the songs ? Will you ever consider doing a meet and greet with your fans? Your favourite subreddits? If you could collaborate with one artist only who would it be? i am sorry that jindal was not the perfect audience but trust me you had an impact on people who genuinely loved your music. I would love to hear your side. How was jindal for you Hey, there Anuv! Appreciate the beautiful songs you make ‚ù§ It intrigues me how well your songs are written, it'd be great if you share the thought process you go through while having it as an idea till you put it in words in the end. When you first started, what was your main driving force? How different is Anuv Jain in real life from his music? Hey anuv, love the new single!! <3 Antriksh is quite different to your previous songs, what made you want to switch it up this time and are we gonna see more songs like antriksh in the future? What does it feel like to be the spokesperson of the indie artists community of India lol? Top 3 animes? Shadi karlo merese pwease Do you listen to any sort of rappers such as Juice WRLD or XXXTentacion? if yes, what do you think about thier music and potential if they had not gone too soon Hi Anuv! Who/What serves the main inspiration for the composition of the melodies for your songs? Hahah I would love to! But maybe an acoustic version first? Hello Anuv, wanted to aks what are your favourite songs? Both your personal songs and any other Bollywood song. Also love your music!! P.S:- My favourite songs are Baarishein and Mishri I had kept that Antariksh of feelings in me for 2 years for someone very very special to me but when I confessed I was heartbroken, how did you handle your heartbreak? (I suppose you experienced one too) Any artists or bands which inspired you into making indie music? Hey just wanna say one thing toote makan tutne k baad or ache se banaye jaaskte hain phirse would love to hear itüôå You mentioned that your songs contain Easter eggs and personal stories. Could you share another example of a hidden story or personal experience behind one of your songs? When are you collabing with zaeden?? Howd you start with singing? And when did you feel you wanted to be a singer? Yo, great to get a chance to interact with you man. I‚Äôm an indie singer-songwriter from Hyderabad and recently came across your music - which I really loved! (Especially Alag Asmaan) I‚Äôve been releasing music for a bit and I‚Äôm shooting my shot here but would absolutely love your opinion and general insight on an upcoming song. Would it be possible to get in touch w you about this? Would definitely understand if that wouldn‚Äôt be possible too. Hope you have a lovely AMA either way. Cheers :) When are you coming to canada? I really wanna see you perform live Any plans on Baarishein 2.0? Were you socially anxious and introvert in college? How did you deal with it? (Going through it rn) How do you mentally prepare yourself for live gigs, considering your background as a shy person? Are there any rituals or routines you follow? What was your inspiration for GUL Bhai love your songs kasoor, cold/mess, tum jab pass. Kaise likh lete ho itna accha? Your performances are known for their stripped-down, intimate style. Do you think you might explore adding more elements or instruments in the future, or do you prefer to keep it simple and focus on the lyrics? It gets a bit heavy sometimes. Doubts do creep in but I try to all the constructive criticism positively and ignore the unnecessary feedback. Its tough but we're getting there hah Will there be a part 2 of Antariksh? Are you single?üëÄ‚ù§Ô∏è Hey, attended your concert in December and the experience was honestly what \"sukoon\" feels like. I absolutely love how you explain the meaning behind every song before performing it. My question for you is- Are you open to releasing a full album someday? Is it something in the works rn? What‚Äôs your dream outcome in 5 years? More music releases, more collabs, new genres of songs, Bollywood, Hollywood? You always say that all of your songs are based on your real life experiences from the past. What is ANTARIKSH based on? What's the back story? Spill the Tea Anuv. üòÇ what car do you own? + do you watch any sport? Hey not much I just want you to know that you are really great at what you do. And I just have a request for you to please sing Guzara in your next love session! Hope you come to Kolkata soon! And yeah antariksh is a fast flowing song with literally one of the most simple and beautiful lyrics!! ü™û How did your parents (and family) react to your career choice? It always has to tell a story! That's always the number 1 thing. Then me and the team, we pick the best art style that goes w the concept How did you first get into writing music? What inspired you? Thank you for sharing your music with us, you bring your listeners so much peace!üíóüå∏ How would you describe your music? u/anuvjain cold/mess part-2 when Are you writing more songs? Also when will next release? Can you explain in brief what your writing process is like? Your lyrics are phenomenal ‚ù§Ô∏è What is your basic itinerary for writing a song? Are you a secret redditor? üëÄ Inspiration while writing the songs!? bhai collab with yoyo honey singh Hey, thank you for making such songs <3 The only thing which i held onto when everything was going downhill in the life . I wanna ask , been waiting for so long for a delhi concert, i still regret that i missed the one With the 17000+ delhi crowd singing along with you . Then you were gonna perform at our college fest (VIPS) , and i was so much happy on that news , but unfortunately as you already know , you couldn't. When are you gonna come to delhi ? (TT) When are you gonna come to UAE for concert? Can I have your black hoodie? :‚Å†^‚Å†) You can really be your biggest enemy! Us creatives always over think! But as you spend more time in the industry you start to trust yourself and take quicker decisions Hey anuv, how would you describe yourself in 6 words or less? When is the extended version of Riha releasing? What do you think about the shift towards electronic music over orchestrated music. Have you heard of c418? How do you find his music Heyyy anuv! When are you planning to perform in Delhi again ? Hey anuv , I'm a little Sitara in your universe Just wanna ask one thing har gana itna zyada relatable kaise likh lete ho. I'm your dead heart fan . Love you so much keep making this kind of music . Tata. I always meet \"people who listen to my music\" after shows. It's physically impossible for me to meet everyone! I really wish I could but I try to see as many people as possible <3 i wanted to ask about mishri since its my fav.. you said it was made out of a word bank that you made for riha but did mishri have like a back story just like all of your other songs do.. i couldn't really find you sharing any back story about it..üí≠ Do you have any rituals or routines that you follow to get into the creative mindset when working on new music? I'd love to hear you sing in different languages. Do you have plans for it? Who was ur inspiration to get into singing - songwriting ?? And ... what kind of MUSIC do u like to listen to ( except ur own genre ) ?? u/anuvjain is there plans for an album anytime soon? Gul has a very Jack Johnson / Joseph Arthur type vibe to it but maybe that's just me. Which international artists have most influenced your music? We know the new song is based how one couldn't gather their courage to actually confess to their crush, so that happened with you ? , Do you still regret that or look back and think it's actually good that you couldn't confess then . Hello there Anuv! Fan of your songs ‚ô•Ô∏è Q- If you had the chance to collaborate with a fellow singer, who would it be and why? Also what's your take on Prateek Kuhad? Everywhere honestly! Especially from all the humans around me haha! My stories w them, their stories, all of it How do you maintain a balance between artistic integrity and catering to the expectations of your audience? Probably asked already - what was your inspiration for alag aasman? Just wanted the say I love alag asmaan and the song's the reason I started playing ukulele. I've watched you playing the song many times but couldn't figure what you exactly do between f c and c7 to create that beautiful melody. Can you explain what do you exactly do...? Jindal was amazing! I had the best time. I don't regret any of the shows that I've done. Have always made the most amazing memories and meet the nicest people :DDDD Is there anytime gonna be a meetup (TT) , where we all could just talk with you. Hello anuv i have been following you on youtube since 7 or 8 years i just wanted to say your music has healed me alot its like my lowkey therapy whenever i m down your music cheers me up like nothing else i just wanted to say never stop making it ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è i wanted to ask about mishri since its my fav.. you said it was made out of a word bank that you made for riha but did mishri have like a back story just like all of your other songs do.. i couldn't really find you sharing any back story about it..üí≠ pls answerrr, I've had this in my mind for the longest time now ahahahaha,ü§û Just wanted to ask how are you doing? Also are you overwhelmed by the response on ANTARIKSH. It's so different yet so beautiful ü•πü§å Will you ever work for any bollywood films / series as playback singer? When are you coming to Chennai! Eagerly waiting for you What made you to go about designing this song in a rap style? Hello Anuv . I'm a huge fan of Mazaak. I just love the wonderful lyrics you've put for the song and the video. I saw you performance live at Zomaland recently and was mesmerized. My friend Pranay who's a HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE fan OF YOURS missed the chance of saying hi to you (your car speeded up). Can you please say Hi to him here (he'll probably die on seeing this) Have you ever been heartbroken ,? hey anuv, I‚Äôm a big fan! During my first heartbreak I listened to baarishein on loop 15 times lol. I‚Äôd love to see you live, when will you be performing in Mumbai next? Also when can we expect an album? Loved the gq cover btw i love your music and it‚Äôs so close to my heart. thank you for that <3 i‚Äôm an artist and it‚Äôs been a dream to make your album cover art someday. is there a way? Nahi dega u/anuvjain How was the experience at dpsk concert? Bro you hear to divine's music? what time of the day do you write your music the most in? Thank you for baarishien. That's all Which was the best City to perform in India? And which countries do you want to travel to perform? This is such a bitchy thing to say ü•± Could we expect some Collabs happening in the near future? Yeah sounds fair... I've manifested that I'm gonna meet you one day!ü§ûüèªüò¨‚ù§Ô∏è When would Anuv hold another concert in Mumbai?? Eagerly waiting for it and loved your Antariksh ü§çüíåüíó‚ú® Did u see a spike in your sex life last year where do you find the inspiration to write such immensely beautiful love songs, does love like that even exist? are you writing songs on a whim? What's your biggest influencer that clicks you to produce smth new? When are you coming to hyd again. ü•π How are you so clear with what word would make the perfect song title.? say ANTARIKSH as it comes only one time in the song. Btw, I loved the music video and the concept behind the song. Wasn't expecting this from Anuv jain. It totally blew my mind !! When will \"Jo tum mere ho\" will be releasing??... Please telll. That's very true! I totally believe that but that line is not a stand alone lyric. It's a part of the larger body and that's the entire song. It'll make sense in that context. But I work w optimism and I know things can be fixed until they just aren't possible to be fixed further :,) Independent vs signed who earns more According to you Would u ever release your own merch? That ARIA reference from MAZAAK mv was crazyyyyyyy so thoughtfulü´°ü™Ñ Collab with Arman malik? Hey Anuv, First of all, A HUGE fan of your music and really love your songs. I have 2 Questions: 1. Who were your main sources of inspiration when you just had started songwriting and what are some things in your mind while you write any of your songs? 2. At what age did you start your music journey? Would love to work w ZAEDEN! He's like a brother and I honestly feel that we can make something brilliant! x How is Anuv jain , in reality ? How will you define yourself , Expect from how we assume you through songs and the socials , What new instruments do you hope to incorporate in your music? How do you feel about your songs potentially being featured in films? Hello Anuv, I am a big fan of your works, Especially Riha man, I am super proud of you, I just want to know, that please please please can we have an album? üíó We would love to listen to your album already C'mon everyone loves you x Antariksh is different from that of your normal genre and style.. was it just an experiment? What was the thought process? I mean it's a goood song, but, the style in your earlier songs is much prettier.. lots of love Anuv the new music had a very unique vibe! Do have any thought on keeping the same tone ? and have you any thoughts of putting out an EP or Mixtape soon ? what do u think about the masterpiece that is PPAP by pikotaro You love cookies right? Have you ever faced challenges or have been forced to make music for Bollywood? Heard that it's not kind to indie artists and hoping that you keep proving them wrong every damn time!!! it always based on part relationships and experiences! All of it. Some sad, some happy. Also, thank you. That really means the world :D Some of it is :) my beloved my baby boy my everything you tear me apart & yet i love u anuv üò≠‚ù§ Anuv jain Karle tu gain Khana khale dabhake Aur hoja bechain Nangi si aatma ko mat de itna dosh Bas kar mere bhai aayushman ko karna roast Karta hu Dil se Dil Tak ki bat Jab tak represent hai mere sath ü´£ Who you? I honestly have no clue. I love mishri, gul, barishen, riha, all your songs tbh. thank you for being you. Hey man, I really appreciate ur music, u r doing great job, when are y dropping ur next songs ? How many relationships you had in your past and are you in one rn? I wanna know too if he watch animes !! Hopefully soon! Delhi crowd is amazing and I always feel at home there time to take over reddit nowüòàü´∂üèª Antariksh is ‚Äúout of the world (antariksh)‚Äù. Looping on it!! Gul remains closest to my heart. I feel it expresses how my ex-girlfriend grew over our breakup and liberated from the toxicity that the relationship gave her. I like it for her! :) Hello Anuv , So In your latest release Antariksh, Did you tried rapping coz it sounded very good on that beat. Will you make more rap type/fast paced songs like these often in future? Do you like it being called a Rap Song? You don't like Antariksh being called a rap right?? What keeps you grounded? May I ask what is your inspiration behind those lyrics?? Because it looks like something you have experienced deeply in the past. How can this guy get his heart broken. He literally dedicated the whole space to that one person. Aarghh ! I am jealous. The new song and the lines üò≠ it‚Äôs too beautiful Are you an AI When are you cominggg toooo jaipurrrrrrrrrrrr The song antariksh is love Do you use ASMR in your music? Have you heard JoJo‚Äôs Bizarre adventure theme? If you could collab with an international artist, who would you pick? Hi Anuv, Mishri holds a very special place in my heart, and always will. I imagine it's akin to asking a parent about their favourite child, but which of your own songs do you hold closest? Bruh that's mad! 7 years is a very long time. Thank you so much for sticking around. I really hope that you've enjoyed the journey so far Hey anuv, aspiring singer/songwriter here....could you please give me some tips for how do you chose a chord progression for particular song and how do you decide the scale? much love to you<3 ‡§∏‡§æ‡§≤‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§∏‡•ú‡§ï‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡•á ‡§∏‡§Å‡§≠‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ö‡§≤ ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§ó‡§æ‡§≤‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ó‡§°‡•ç‡§¢‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§§‡•á‡§∞‡•á ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•ú‡§ñ‡•ú‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§ì, ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ê‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§Å‡§∏‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡•á ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§§‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç, ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§á‡§®‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ñ‡•ã ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å‡§ó‡§æ ‡§è ‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§¶, ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§¶‡§®‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§®‡§ï‡•á ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã ‡§ú‡§º‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§∞‡§π‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•á ‡§Ü‡§∏-‡§™‡§æ‡§∏, ‡§§‡•ã ‡§§‡•á‡§∞‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§π‡•ã ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ä‡§Å‡§ó‡§æ These are easily some of the most heartwarming and loving lyrics I've heard in any song. How do you write your songs? Do you have any sort of help in formation of your lyrics and is it just a literal translation of your source feelings into words? u/anuvjain How did youuuu writeee it i mean i know the lyrics meaning but the song whole what was the idea behind it sorryyyy missed the live Would you pls make an album of your songs acoustic versions... Especially antariksh. I love it. Do all the lyrics of the songs come from your personal experience? what inspired you to write antariksh? Just come to Jaipur plsssss!! When you were really young, was there a moment that made you realize you could be a musician growing up? how and when did you decide that you wanted to be a musician When can we expect Guzara and jo tum mere ho? :) This ones a bit personal. I wrote both Mishri and Riha for my mom and dad. I lost my father a few years ago and wanted to write something from my mom to him. That's where the songs come from. Mishri is the \"WIP\" song and Riha is the final song Your songwriting process please. Also come to Goa!!! Do you compose on your instrument directly or first on paper. Do you use any software for the same and how do you see composition made digitally? Omgggggggggg how are youuuuuuu Anuvvvvvv please replyyyyyy just hi or anything it means the world to me trust me Hey, You are like the only celebrity (yes sir i will call you a celeb) jiske peeche i have fan girl-ed the most.

I missed the live :((((( your songs are embodiment of a home like fr when did you decide that you want to be a singer? Did you experience oppose from your parents or people around? What inspired you to pursue a career in singing? How do you prepare yourself mentally and physically before a performance? Your New song Antariksh has been such a jam loving it, your music have evolved a lot man. Stay strong brother. Is it true that \"tootey makaan\" is a 9/11 reference I really am! I think I'm perpetually overwhelmed. This life seems unreal. The support seems unreal. Feels like a movie tbh! Antariksh is a very important song for me. Like you said its so different! I wanted to see how people take it. I think it's been great so far Just want to say you're music is amazing Also, your voice is beautiful When was the last time you were heartbroken and how did you come out of it ? Would love to if the right opportunity presents itself! I found ki Antariksh ka BG got similar vibes as Riha. Was it some coincidence, or is it just me having a delusion? Also, as an indie artist, what are some of the best things you can experience which maybe other artists don't? Heyy anuv!! Me and my gf really want to know when's your next concert in Bangalore? ü•∫ About your latest single 'Antariksh' It's literally my current situation... i want to dedicate that song to her and also wanna sing it to her but I'm afraid about how she will react afterward... will she accept my feelings or will she decline..

Hoping for a reply to make my day happy. Need blessings and hugs. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôà I swear all cities offer something different. I'm not even being diplomatic. It's hard picking a few. Talking about countries, I'm really looking forward to go to Bangladesh (I have a show there). Also, UK will be amaze too! Honestly I always felt that this actually might be a thing.

Although I do believe that a stunning album can be made out of your existing songs too hehe! Hey Anuv, your favorite artists who inspires you? Soon hopefully otherwise my mom will murder me! She loves that song haha I think signed artists right now but we'll hopefully get there someday What the poet wanted to refer is that once a relationship is broken it can‚Äôt be rebuild like before. Sir in love with ur songs wanna ask the inspiration behind the magical melody alag aasman especially fr that ending prose \"Khali ghar tera yeh chabiyon ki gunj aise tujhe dara rhi tu darna nhi main hu yahi par\" HAINA?????????????????

(Check your Insta DMs)ü•π Hey Anuv! Do you plan to expand into genres which you haven't yet breached into? Like, something more rock oriented, or maybe a bit funky tunes? How did you end up doing this AMA? ü§£ I guess it's the title Antariksh that is actually making the views and plays go with the speed of a rocket man!üöÄ I am too good at bad jokes :,) A collaboration between you and armaan malik is needed ANUVVVVVV MY MOST FAV SONG OF YOURS IS ALAG AASMAN!!!!!!!

HAA YAARR!!!!!!! I'm a pretty chill guy man. I am very passionate about a few things like football and tennis and I follow both sports religiously. I get lazy sometimes. I have the same set friends that I had in school. I like to think that I'm the funny guy of my group but friends will refute that claim. I'm a little spoilt coz my sister and mom both treat me like a kid. I love people fully. I try to be a good person. I eat a lot of Nutella and watch a lot anime! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èyou replied Hey is your favourite football team Manchester United?? I'll cry. That'll be so huge for me and my family Please come to Bengaluru and perform! When are we getting aur tum mere ho song Did you found yet ke ... Toote maka ek baar girte to waise bante kaha hai ? As artists we all want to move out of our comfort zone and try new things. I guess we just want to prove ourselves that we can pull off the abnormal. I will get to my usual style of music. But I'll also experiment once a while. You know have a good balance. Hey.......did you have a good voice since childhood?....if not how did you improve your voice to be so soft...can you recommend anything for sm1 who likes to sing but people close their ears when they sing :( Are you planning on coming to Ahmedabad this year? Or Mumbai? More than musician you are a story teller and you are damn good in it, keep on sharing stick to ground because thats where the stories come from. Did any of your ex came back after listening to you before you got fame. Thanks for good stuff man, there is a time when i just listen to you and its therapeutic. You‚Äôve impacted my life immensely. I followed you from your first songs, introduced all my friends to you!!! Your songs have supported me through the worst of times the times I had no one by my side. So just wanted to thank you. Is there any way I can get in touch with you more personally? Also can we get Anuv jain merch anytime soon? hiiiii I'm listening to since 2020 and honestly I love your songs soo sooo sooo muchhhh waiting for your concert in gorakhpur and release of \"Jo tum mere ho\" i don't even know if you're going to read this or not but you've helped me so much during my exams so much as stress buster üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üåô Since you've performed in a lot of concerts till now, are there any favourites for you?

Bro just quit music Alright sir/ma‚Äôam. Do you üçÉüö¨ before writing/composing your songs? First off love you songs. Just curious as an artist myself, how does your creative process go? Like integrating storytelling with music is cool and was curious how you started out with it and what your process currently looks like. And any tips for beginners are also welcome. Bhai aapke makaan tute hi kyu the? I can't thank you enough for writing songs. I really appreciate what you do, lockdown would have been so miserable if Spotify hadn't recommended your songs. Truly therapeutic they are. Thank you so much !! Lot's of love and success to you. Will you be my friend???? (Lol) What are your future plans? Will we get any another song like Alag Aasmaan? Did you go to uni? If you did, then what did you study there? That's great. It's bound to happen.. (Also please release Riha extended with \"Jo tum mere Ho\".. with the OG \"..kya chahta hai\" set of lyrics as wel.. Riha is just something else.. ) I've always been socially anxious. I've never felt too comfortable around people and I always think too much. Conversations often feel unnatural but I'm getting better. I've experienced so much over the last couple of years. Gives me a lot of cool things to talk about hah When you shoot the video for Antariksh for example, are you actually signing while filming or is the audio added after? Whats the process like to come up with the music video? Hey! Anuv firstly loves your new song. There is a question from my side about how things were when you shifted from your family business to music(as you said) and you even completed your collage so your love of music didn't become a conflict with you and everything and secondly you write amazing lyrics like a poetry has lot of meanings which is great so what make you write in that context only (inspiration?)? Thankyou üòä Can you tell us about any interesting or unexpected experiences you've had while performing or touring? also im a big fan of yours I discovered your music in late December and have kept listening to them on repeat ever since. Your voice is magical! I wonder what you think before writing such deep and complicated lyrics. Is just one of your ways of expressing your own feelings and emotions in a lyrical manner or do you base the lyrics upon insipirations from daily life? Heartbreak is very tricky! I wish I could answer it but I was never able to take it to gracefully. We're all human and these things do affect us. I think I just wrote songs about it and felt better Hey, I'm a big fan of yours! Heartiest congratulations on Antariksh, it is just amazingüíï. I really can't stop playing it on loop. What has been the best performance of your career so far?

He misses his home and cannot help but gravitate towards your lyrics and your melody. The day your song Antariksh was released, he had knocked on my door to listen to it together. I hope your muse blesses you to make people cry (very good for health) and soothe their spirits with even more beautiful songs. Can you make a song about a girl woh make you happy i know its hard but please mhuu I'm here I'm here. My fingers are hurting from the excessive typing. But I'm trying to respond to everyone before the time runs up You said in an interview that you were a very camera-shy person. After filming the Antariksh mv, how did you overcome, or deal with camera-shyness? I'm very happy! Who wouldn't want their music to be heard by everyone. It does come with it's problems and stresses tho. I'm trying to learn how deal w it.

I tried to change the song to a song I liked but he went bonkers. xD If I'm not wrong, you're a united fan, right? Has being a red devil over the kast decade impacted your music? I mean, it's pretty tough being optimistic. Love your songs. -a fellow red devil(hopefully I'm not wrong else it's embarrassing xD) when and how you found out that music is your calling , actually asking for myself only been stuck in the same position Hey Anuv , any chance of you collaborating with foreign artists?

She remains mad at me Hi Anuv, when are you next performing and will there be any concerts in gurgaon/delhi ? Will you release any new songs this year? Alag Aasmaan and baarishein two songs are my most favorite (specially Alag Aasmaan). I want another song like Alag Aasmaan that has ukulele in it.

I also remember being a part of the online concert(unfortunately the only concert I got to experience) you had during lockdown and you explaining the lyrics and playing the music was amazing. Your songs genuinely heal and it's always been so therapeutic listening to you and I'm so glad I came across your music aha!! Would love to see you play irl sometime! <3 (Which brings me to, would you be coming to Vadodara again? I found out you'd performed in a med school there and I'd like see you if you come again aaa!!) Sending you so much love!! And insanely proud of all of the growth! üíó Bruhhhh very generic comments that i love ur music But could you plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz read some of my poetry????

Sir reply kardo, ladiz log ko flex karna hai ‚ù§ What's your creative process like? Do you have any tips for aspiring artists? are your songs from real life experiences? Toote Makan song Yogi Ji se inspired hoke likha tha kya? What do you do to clear your head when going through a creative slump? Do you love me? Kya aap thande thande paani se nahate ho Hey, Anuv! Been listening to your music ever since I first heard 'Ocean' about 3-4 years back. My question to you is: Is there any difference in your creative process when you write a song with English lyrics? Kitna kma lete ho? Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers. We need you in your MUSIC VIDEOS pleaseeeeee !!!! Lmfao Hey Anuv, I am extremely grateful for your music. Gul has been a journey for me. It beautifully captured my emotions and touched the strings of my heart ever since I heard it last year. It's the only song that makes me cry whenever I listen to it (so much so that i only listen to it when I'm alone and cry like a baby :P). Thank you for creating this magic ‚ú®Ô∏è Who are your favourite artists? I heard one of your songs last year (Mazaak) and it was the day I met this beautiful woman, and she is now my girlfriend.. every time I see her, it is always magical and I end up recalling the lyric: Girta rahoon teri rahon mein Aur in mein hee kho jaunga Just on the end note, thank you for giving us such amazing songs and hope you win more in life ‚ú® Damn bro respect How would you advise someone who wants to sing like you do? Like my register goes pretty high but it doesn't have the weight in it. On the other hand when you sing in head voice you manage to make it sound breathy and not nasally. You have such a unique voice. Pls give some tips to us plebs hii anuv, just wanted to say that i never really liked your music until i fell in love with my boyfriend, also, i gotta ask, would you date a person that's not politically and culturally compatible with you? Aww man you're actually taking the time to respond to as many people as you can...you're awesome :') I've always related to your songs and surprisingly me and my bf relate to your song Alag Asmaan ( mostly because we are in long distance relationship) what was your inspiration or what motivated you to write that song and if you would suggest one thing to couples in ldr what would you suggest? HEY ANUV!! just wanted to tell u that your music was there with me throughout my breakup phase. I bet it doesn't mean much to you, but it helped me aloot! I made a private playlist , they was on repeat for so so long! Now I've completely healed, and the fact that you're doing this now, is just giving me an opportunity to express how proud I am of you! hope you can get through all the hate and hardships of this world with ease, because as a budding artist u deserve all the love one can offer you :)) loads of love! my name is shreya and thank you for everythinggg. also love your hairstyle and skin, it's perfect, do u have a skincare routine? or just use an 8-1 shampooüò≠ Noooooo way this is the real ANUV Jain I ll cryyyy istg Dude, I have heard Alag Aasma on loop so many times, that I have lost count. Thanks for a song that gives me a new hope everytime. So you are a weeb? No wonder itna rr krte ho gaano me /s Don't mind me, I'm just here to fangirl hey anuv. no questions, just wanted to convey that ur songs are amazing and whenever i feel down, i just listen to baarishein, the song gives me feels like no other! hope u keep composing amazing songs. lots of love. alsoo please please please organize a concert in bangalore i would love to attend it!!!!! Hii Anuv, I never really got a chance to see you live. It would really mean the world to me if you say hi. Dont need to ask anything as your music does that quite well already. Big fan, thanks for your music! I don't think you're here anymore and there are way too many comments xD. But your music is frickin amazing. I belong to the covid batch of school so our 11,12th were online. Met my best friend through your songs tbh. Other than that we hosted meets for questions solving and we played \"alag aasman\" on repeat. After that she went off to kota, and again your songs helped me to deal with the absence haha. It always reminds me of her and the good times we've had. You had a plan in my city, sadly we had preboards and shit. I wish I had attended though. Any plans of coming back to lko? Also, tons of love and appreciation dude. I frickin love your music. What is the procedure to date you... ü§î so that I can have a live streaming of youü§© your songs I meanüòã I just wanted to say your song 'Alag Aasman' is one of my all time favourites.

Thanks for existing ü´∂üèªü•∫ Hey anuv! first of all i love you and your music so so much . My question is there's this pattern like you leave clues in your song for the next album/song like in mazaak that \"aria\" part and which is used in this album and there like hints we see and i find it so brilliant . how do you get such ideas? I'm trying to write some songs and it is good also but after some days my mood got changed and I think it's good but not that (but it is) can you give me some tips to concentrate on your own experience. Hi Anuv. I've listened to few of your songs and they're really soothing to listen. I'm kinda interested in singing but I feel that my voice is really deep and I don't seem to make the most out of it. How can I improve the way I sing if you have any sort of suggestions which are applicable. Would really appreciate your suggestions. Thanks! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Big fan of yours listening your music about 2 hours it help me in my bad times and story's in your comment are different vibe keep making music love you man big fan Which is your favourite song?

Your words are magic. Please come to Kerala soon, there's a lot of Anuv Jain fans there who are waiting for you.

I have been following you for 5+ years now. I attended your concert with my boyfriend, but we are separated now. Since then, whenever I listen to your songs, it gives me a bittersweet feeling which is hard to put in words :\") not a big fan but one of your fans.. love ur song.. feels soothing in a way Your favourite song ? Who is your favourite lyricist? Also loved alag asman. Changed my life. What inspires you to write songs that tell stories?

I own a cloud bakery do you ever feel low cuz of the memes on insta and everywhere else? btw love your music Of all the places for this, you chose this post? Why? Is it nice to be a twat? I did heard some of your song before they got popular I really love the way you sing Lots of love ‚ú® Your voice is great and songs are good, but hard to remember.. You gotta make few songs with simple lyrics and easy to sing along chorus.. You'll get a larger audience then bro doesn't know what dahej is just give the link in comments if you are lucky he will listen How was your experience as a student at NMIMS? Did it influence your music in any way? Konse demolition company ke PR ho ? Ass or tits?!, idk just and AMA paramparaaüòÇ Hi Anuv, just wanted to let you know that I loved Antariksh very much. You are amazing. How many songs of yours are never released compared to the ones which are Like what would be a rough ratio ? Hey Anuv, Big fan. I really regret getting introduced to your songs really late. Your songs have the feels man. Especially in the situation I am in, it feels it‚Äôs written just for me. Btw, are these songs written for someone? I mean what‚Äôs inspiration or motivation behind the songs? Apart from your voice/music, the storytelling in the song is something I really like, poetry, basic but so effective. I keep your songs in my happy place playlist due to this. Will you keep your releases like this in future too with guitar/acoustic vibe or experiment with some snappy beats in between like say, how dhruv does in moonlight ? Woooooahhhhhhh üíÄ‚ù§Ô∏è Weirdly specific question but I‚Äôm surprised he had an answer for that. Is fav time of the day to write a thing among artists üò≥ Bhai toote makan kaise jode? Mai Abdullah bol rha hu uttar pradesh se. Hey anuv, just wanna say I really love your music I attended your concert here in Jaipur in JK Lakshmipati....and dude you were amazing....your voice , your stories , your smile , everything was beautiful. I love your songs!!~~ also do you listen to old songs? I want to hear you sing ‚ÄúJab koi baat bigad jaye, jab koi mushkil pad jaye‚Äù jk lol but i too want to sing, for like myself but my voice is pathetic whenever I do so.. is it something I can work upon or i just need to cope w it? Hey Anuv, just letting you know, your music is GODLY. Your voice is SO SOOTHING I LOVE IT. I have listened to all of your music. It just so good. Some make me tear up . Keep doing what you doing. You are AMAZING. Loads of LOVE. Anuv, maybe try to diversify? Sometimes your music sounds like CAS, all the same. Hope you can keep your core but maybe elevate the experience a bit why integrating different aspects, like how Agam does. Hi Anuv, I am a big fan of yours. I am going through a little hard time in life right now ur music has helped me alot. I just wanted to ask that what inspired you to write the song GUL? P.S. LOVE YOU‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Anuvvv, mazaak mazaak mein, Mazaak ke wajhe se, I found the loml <3 :‚Äù) If u going to reply to this than bro you songs are good and i want to know that how do u come up with your lyrics?? ... I have listened to Gul and that is one amazing song and i hope you will make more mesmerizing songs in future.. What‚Äôs your favourite football team Where you from I see that you joined reddit in 2021 . Which subs u r really like and spend time on . Lmfao bruh üíÄ I feel the criticism that people have had with your music is how they don't believe it comes from the place of reality even though it sounds very good. How much do you disagree with them. What is your writing process? Do you focus on making songs or do you write usually what you're feeling? Hey Anuv, my most recent ex is a big fan of yours! We use to listen to your songs when we were together. Can you give Mansi a shoutout in reply? Much appreciated if you do! Once again your art is magnificent. your voice is just too ü§åü§å brought spotify premium just too download your songs to listen on loop while travelling Are all your songs based on personal experience? Also I loveeee your songs. Thank you for the songs that keep me at peace! 'Ship of Theseus' - an object which has had all of its original components replaced remains the same object? Which countries would you like to do a concert in? Hey Anuv, Me and my girlfriend (now ex) had started falling in love around the time you released Riha. I associated that song with our relationship, but boy did I not understand the meaning. Only now when we have parted ways does the song make sense. Although for me the song ends like this; Jab tak miloon nhi, taron mein mil kahin. Now for the question, How you doing today? Sir toote makan ghir ke kyon nhi bante? hey anuv even though i messaged you on insta but i will again send you my rock version of your new song antriksh :-) would like your review [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14QezABP6qz8PnUOVoHnMP9KfXqpPYA1C?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14QezABP6qz8PnUOVoHnMP9KfXqpPYA1C?usp=sharing) feedbacks welcomed from all... Baarishein ü©µ My girlfriend asks how do you write such beautiful lyrics? Do you have a girlfriend YES PLEASE The first song I ever heard was \"Alag Asmaan.\" It's crazy how that song brought some amazing people into my life. I just wanted to say that I absolutely love your music! The way you express yourself through your songs is simply mind-blowing. Keep doing what you do because it's awesome! Can we get you for a concert for free, just the travel and hotel. We wish for a college fest with no admin support, only student funded .. Inter or Man. City in ucl final? Barishein is always and forever in my heart Do you play any games?? Hope you enjoyed the wedding in mussoorie. Was a fun time. How did you find St. Georges? hi anuv‚ù§Ô∏è! in what way would you say that your heart is a wave? Hey anuv, your favourite books? We had invited you to our college fest.. at December in Mumbai.. why'd you/your team reject it.. :( Thoughts about Dehradun Dale Jamboree music festival? How was your experience performing in Dehradun? Where did you goooo Lmao How can one start on the path of songwriting? I have always been interested in music, but childhood me never got to fulfill his wish of learning an instrument. Where to begin? Is there a process to it? Also, huge fan of Ocean ‚ù§Ô∏è Anuv! Tumhe nahi pata hai ki Mazaak Mazaak mein kya kya ho gaya. Ek ladka tha jo mere jaise hi gaane sunta tha. Ek din maine usko bola ki, \"pata hai, Anuv ka naya gaana aaya hai\". Us din, hum dono ne, parking garage ke rooftop pe, pehli baar Mazaak suna, aur us din se vo humara gaana ban gaya aur hum, \"hum\" ban gaye:\") all thanks to Mazaak. Hello Anuv, I've come across Indie-Pop like a year back and I'm loving the scene in India. And of course, my initial few songs included 'Gul' and I very much adore it till date! <3 Now to my question, what other genres do you listen to? What instruments can you play? Which ones your favorite? Huge fan btw. Been following you since baarishein was posted by the last cigarette. How do you come up with concepts which is unique and makes you stand you out from the other artists? Hey Anuv! Hope you‚Äôre well. As a fellow musician, I genuinely admire your songwriting skills. Any advice on how can I find my ‚Äòvoice‚Äô and be authentic with my writing as well? When are you coming to Nepal again? hello, anuv jain. I don't have any question to ask you, just keep working hard. Tell us about your upcoming song Messi or ronaldo?? (or someone else you'd like to mention) Does any of your songs relate to your personal life. If one or many please mention one. We just want to know the depth is in the art or in the artist himself:] love ya Anuv ‚ù§Ô∏è ^ You baarishien is all time relief : even in this hot summer^ Bro, i can't just express what your songs means to me. Through every cheerful moments to the lowest point of my life, your songs felt warm and healing. \"Aye nahi, jinke the waadein Waqt uljha hua hai tere yahan pe Kya woh kal the yahan? Yaan hafton pehlay ki yeh hai dastaan?\" The person on whom you counted on, but they just ghosted at the most difficult times. But you used to consider them as your \"closest one\" This song, acts like a therapy... As if someone just came and sat beside you, while you are in a dark room trying to figure out where did you go wrong. He gives you hope, strength, hugs you and makes you believe in yourself again. You don't know him, but you know you can count on him and he can heal you. \"Aayega ik din Jab unki raatein yoon na mehfooz hongi Tere, tere bin aise Tu dekh lena Teri kami tab unko mehsoos hogi Mujhe Mujhe hai pata yeh\" \"Ha ja rahe ho duur tum to kya? Main hi to dil ka musafir To ek baar phir tu hanske zara Dekh le meri in aankhon mein Main kaid kar loon har wo pal tera Teri ye baatein jo hain\" Representing a sweet love story between a long distance couple. Seems like he just made every phase of my life a song, but in an amazingly expressed way. My life's quite messy lmfao unlike his songs. He adds the perfect thing to say when she is mad at you for some reason. I am not good at expressing and he just penned my exact thoughts and feelings towards my long distance partner, in the most creative way. How do you do this Bro!!? \"Ab Tere Bina Yahan Meri Saansein Jaise Bina Nindiya Ki Raatein Hai Toh Aur Tu Hi Mere Dil Ki Raza Hai Tere Bina Dil Bhi Khafa Hai Toh\" When you are madly in love with someone and you have planned everything with them in your mind, you achieved such a level of emotional bonding with them, you just feel incomplete without them. Again, the exact feeling you would have at that moment penned in a beautiful manner. I talked abt lyrics so long. What about the music? AH! do I even have to tell abt that?? There is no artist, that made me love each and every song of them, trust me, no one, EXCEPT ANUV JAIN! His songs are the only ones which i can listen on repeat for unlimited time period, and still cherish the extraordinary lyrics and music. Trust me, I have to say, i am compelled to say, he is the one and only artist to hold such a talent. I never met you in reality, but tbh you still feel like one of my family people Yes please, the acoustic version I too want to become a big artist/songwriter in America. Do you think it‚Äôs possible being I‚Äôm from India Lower middle class ? What are the problems I may face ? Do celebs and artists have a Resume like we normies do? Or just the portfolio of their past work and stuff? You suck bro, that's all i gotta say Hi Anuv, I don't have a question, I just want to tell you that I'm a big fan of your music, so much so that for some time I had started thinking that I had lost the ability to appreciate new music and could only find comfort and solace in the songs that I had been listening to since childhood. But, your songs made me believe that I can still appreciate new music. While playing FIFA, I just open your profile on spotify and listen to all your songs randomly, they're so soothing. Hey Anuv, I don't listen to Indie music or Bollywood, I'm totally into Hip-hop and rap. Which songs would you recommend me to 1. To listen to Anuv Jain. 2. Indie music. whats your personal fav song of yours and others both indian and foreigner Who are ur musical influences or go to artists that u listen too..Plus any song recommendations ? Just wanna drop by to thank you for your music man. There is a kind of art that makes you feel relief. And yours is that. Thank you for pursuing music. How has life been to you recently? Hi I really love your songs. I love the Fact that you use your Real True authentic voice in your songs than most of the people who use Autotune. I would like to mention The live version of GUL you recorded in the Forest. It sounds so real and beautiful. I think other artists should learn this from you. Some expressions can be communicated much better when its Real Hi I really love your songs.

Can u tell what is it pls your songs are just great, love them How to be consistent with our art?...with everything we need to do irl, how to make out the time, motivation and be consistent with it. I am going to point out that I am still a student and do not have a job, and I feel like there are so many things I need to do which leave me with no energy or motivation afterwards... Would love some advice from a professional. Hello Anuv Jain, I just wanted to tell you something, Leave some girls for the rest of us. Thank you Tere muh ke shabad itne controversial section me kyu hai? I think it‚Äôs more like at some point the cloth has more patches than it‚Äôs base layer and you can‚Äôt keep going like that. It‚Äôs deteriorating. A big Anuv Jain and anime fan here!!!! I can‚Äôt believe you watch anime too!!!!! I‚Äôm so glad to know that. I hope you‚Äôre still there and can share some of your favourite anime series/movies UwU Just wanted to ask what's the most unpredictable thing that has ever happened to you apart from ur career.? And would it be possible for me to meet you some day üò≠? Since I can't get an autograph here, Could you do a dear u/error1105 and just write your name? üóø But fan tho! Hi Anuv, Love your music.. been a fan for years now. Performing live anytime soon in Delhi? Heyy Anuv, got a question here......Will we ever get a mix of genre music from you?? Like one which contains your type of verse with rap or something?? Mann I'm bad at explaining but I think you got it :) Hey nuv, im a really big fan of yours. I even want to attend your concerts so badly but since im just a teenager, i can't. And then i feel so bad for not being able to meet you yet. It has been a year since i have been listening to your songs and you have helped me get out of so many situations. Im here ,alive, and you are one of the biggest reasons for it. Thankyou nuv. Im forever grateful and i love you.ü•∫ Why so desperate mam?? (Contented to see you alive tho) I love listening to your songs!!! My friends are tired of hearing me sing \"tootay makan\" everyday. üòÇ Mishri got me through some of my worst times and I absolutely love Baarishein! Waiting for the day you will come and perform in Pakistan or in the US!!! Will travel to whichever city just to hear you live ‚ù§Ô∏è ayooooo hxh fansss Hey Anuv how do you come up with the acoustics of your songs like the finger picking pattern and the chords‚Ä¶..? Also it took me 3 months to properly play and sing GUL lol. And how do you take care of your throat so that it dosent get sore and you can sing high notes with ease...? PS: I love the amount of intensity you put in your songs , absolutely amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Hey Anuv Jain! I absolutely love you and your music. Please marry me. What's your outlook on the censorship in India, do you yearn to have impact on the culture like Sidhu Moosewala (RIP)? Hahah he's my favourite artist that's all, the comment was meant as a joke didn't write it seriously Please tell us the detailed strumming pattern for Alag Aasmaan Ukulele. PS. I started learning ukulele because of your song Ocean. Anuv! Tumhe nahi pata hai ki Mazaak Mazaak mein kya kya ho gaya. Ek ladka tha jo mere jaise hi gaane sunta tha. Ek din maine usko bola ki, \"pata hai, Anuv ka naya gaana aaya hai\". Us din, hum dono ne, parking garage ke rooftop pe, pehli baar Mazaak suna, aur us din se vo humara gaana ban gaya aur hum, \"hum\" ban gaye:\") all thanks to Mazaak. we need a mumbai concert soonü•π Hi Anuv, I'm an aspiring songwriter and I've been very inspired by you, I've been looking up to you for a very long time. ‚Ä¢ I wanna know how you practice your vocals, dod you learn it from anywhere or is it natural? ‚Ä¢ Also one more thing is it really necessary to know how to play an instrument to compose a song or we can compose it in our head as well and then get it produced later on? Seeing all these other artists who are not playing any instrument while performing. i read here on reddit that you cheat on your girlfriends do you actually cheat on your girlfriends? how would u feel when i demolish your house? (Tootay makaan Ik baar gir kar waise bante kahan hai?) I recently started listening to your songs (mostly because my friends won't shut up about it, lol), and have come to really enjoy the quiet and peaceful feeling I get from some of the songs. So what I wanted to ask was, what's next? I mean, what do you plan you doing in the future? new songs, new genres maybe (..??) Damnnn never thought anuv Jain watches anime xD Thank you so much! That really means so much ü§ç Are you working on any new music? Also who mixes and masters and your music? I‚Äôm an upcoming musician and I‚Äôd love to get some tips Hahah guess we‚Äôll never know I love you anuvv It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve been doing for a bit now so I can‚Äôt really say! But it was about 3 years ago when I got into music ‚Äúprofessionally‚Äù. It had started doing to well enough for me to get into it and I‚Äôm so happy that I did whenever i listen to your music i just end up putting alag aasman on repeat so never discovered you much as an artist hahah üò≠ I‚Äôm okayish‚Ä¶. Have been a bit stressed tbh. Haven‚Äôt been sleeping properly but hanging in there I‚Äôm barely a celebrity! I really don‚Äôt like that word tbh. Consider me a friend Comments in my lives really make me chuckle man. Even when I‚Äôm singing the saddest one. People say funny shit haha you didn't reply‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è Hey Anuv, actually I met you at the Delhi concert at JNS in the month of august... With the handmade posters of your amazing music backstage. Well idk if you do remember but wanted to say that to date your music is amazing and I'm always a huge fan of yours!! <33 I thought it‚Äôll be cool. I don‚Äôt really have much of a presence here on Reddit. Maybe this‚Äôll help a bit? HAVE NEVER SMOKED AND NEVER WILL Yes :( I really hope we win the FA Cup :( I have a split in my head regarding this. Everyone around me tells me that it‚Äôs great and it definitely drives the numbers but I feel sad coz some of these are very sad stories/memories from my life. Looking at it getting reduced to a meme isn‚Äôt the best thing. But I‚Äôm learning to accept that all songs have their own path. Maybe these songs had this one Hai although that 8s rebuild but the vibe and energy will not be the same Shell-don Hey! What headphones do you use while editing or listening to music?. Also any thoughts about what a frequency chart should look like in your opinion?. Do you think the quality of indian music has degraded and the poetry hidden in the lyrics of the songs has disappeared and they have become no more than words with a superficial meaning I hope my music stays relevant. I‚Äôll probably disappear on my own after a few years and never be seen again. Coz.. aye na Teri yaad unko Who hurt you man ü•∫ I‚Äôm slowly becoming more confident. It‚Äôs so funny coz I can‚Äôt explain it to the world. It‚Äôs like I literally freeze in front of the camera. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my hands. I get so awkward ahah but I‚Äôm getting better When will the fansign be held in jaipur? ü•∫ Jigglypuff is pretty cute and she sings too ahah same same, it looks difficult rn but winning the FA Cup and stoping city from winning the treble would be the path for restoring the glory Which song of yours you like the most? Or any specific order of your liking? Which is your dream place that you want to visit once in life? I swear I tried but hot water for the win ü•á Well I hope somebody didn't just do identity fraud here lol Who do you think this is??? Ahah I handle all my social media myself. It‚Äôs always me heh So you decided to act like a dick to someone who's taking time to speak to people on this sub, when they easily could have chosen not to? If you don't have something nice to say, why not keep it to yourself? What value did your comment have, beyond potentially making someone feel bad about their creativity and music for no reason at all? I‚Äôve seen it! I‚Äôll watch the latest season soon ^_^ Alag aasmaan repeat pe tha bhai, jab usne reject kiya. Shukriya Bhai Ganon se bhi rulate ho aur abh reply karke bhi love you Man üò©‚ù§Ô∏è, thode khushal gaane bhi banao plssssssssssssss I‚Äôve actually never heard that one. I‚Äôve been pretty vocal about the fact that all my music comes from own stories. Maybe I might‚Äôve missed it but it‚Äôs all ‚Äúreal‚Äù. Sometimes I feel it‚Äôll be difficult for me to write something without using my own experiences For folks unfamiliar with your music, which tracks would you suggest they start with? Love to hear that. Your music is soothing. St. George‚Äôs is soooo pretty! Loved the football pitch. Played a little there too. Had the best time. Might send my kids there 10 years later or something ahah fav anime? HxH stans assemble aaaaaa! Antariksh is SO GOOD. the artwork, the music video, the outfit and the lyrics- I absolutely love everything about it, it‚Äôs been on loop since 18th, heheü´∂üèªüíåüåå Don‚Äôt we all? ‚ú® Existential ‚ú® I‚Äôve seen you grow from 10k yt subscribers to 1 million. Your transformation and growth makes me so so happy. I‚Äôm so grateful that I discovered your music. You‚Äôre literally my comfort singer songwriter, love you max :‚Äù) Do you like Delhi/ Mumbai? toote makan I just want to take care of my family and provide for them. Do good work and hopefully be remembered as someone who gave it his all! Everything else is consequence of the effort I put in. Also, I loved Sidhu‚Äôs music man. What an artist :,( It's a long ass story but i'll make it short.. During lockdown while i was battling skin cancer, I met a girl online who made me feel a lot better. We fell in love eventually..And was determined to follow through.. But due to some turbulence in both of our lives it stopped We didn't talk for 6 months and she was facing some mental health issues.During that time the only thing i had that made me feel connected to her and the world was your song Ocean. Because ironically when we were together she once chose a shirt and jeans for me that matches exactly to yours in the song cover.. It was not just a coincidence but a manifestation for me.. And your lyrics and melody of the song made me want to fight the physical and mental pain i was going through.. So on her birthday during durga puja.. I took the first bus and reached out to her in that same pink shirt and those same jeans and we met for the first time.. And to update.. Three years later.. I've beaten every disease I had at that time and She is still with me ‚ù§..THAAANK YOUUU ANUV! You being on reddit makes us feel like we're closer to you than other artists.. how do you write such meaningful lyrics? Can you give us some pointers on how to actually execute storytelling through a song ? What‚Äôs your biggest regret in life? Oh is that so? Who is this??? Ahah no no this was done w the Reddit India team! I have a few but I‚Äôll keep them to myself tour anytime soon? Ik that you love cats, why don‚Äôt you get one? Why so obsessed w puns? If you weren't pursuing music as profession would you still be doing your business or something else ? do you work for NASA? because you‚Äôre out of this antarikshüöÄüòÆ‚Äçüí® Been loving your songs since the last 5 years or so. Great to know you love anime as well. What makes you happy? Not asking for a friend. I‚Äôm really trying to figure that out tbh. I haven‚Äôt really been the happiest. I thought I will be after everything but it isn‚Äôt how people think it is. But I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll figure it out one day Not a fan but once heard your song called \"Baarishein\" That too on loop was a amazing experience thanks for that and \"Gul\" Song lyrics \"tootay makan ik baar gir kar waise bante kaha hai\" Is still stuck in my mind goated lyrics you have Did you ever confess your love to that ‚ÄúAntariksh‚Äù girl? do you remember me, heh? What are your thoughts on Chooche Chusa? do you remember meee? KOLKATA TOUR WHEN ANUVV?

I remember how you went ahead and put across your YouTube channel details in our onboarding session. Sadly I don't have a picture with me but can proudly say we were part of the same team for a while. Magical journey from there to where you are now. Wish you all the best, keep shining! How did you learn to sing? Hey Anuv, big fan. Your songs give pretty much of a GenZ vibe which I enjoy a lot. Kinda relatable lyrics and a cult music. Perfect for a day out or a night out with neon city lights. I'd love if you have a concert at Raipur someday. How did you start with Songwriting? Since when have you been writing songs? hey anuv please check out suzonn and try making a collab with him please also I LOVE your music man alag aasman is what made me pick up my guitar after years and i love you for that thank you so much your music is so healing ALSO PLEASE PREFORM IN HYD Baarishein and Alag aasmaan resonated with me on a profound level, and when I shared them with my boyfriend, he revealed they were among his favorites too. From that point on, these songs became forever linked with him. I am grateful to you for creating such beautiful music. What inspired you to make alag aasmaan? I wish I was a part of your baarishein hobknob. When will you have another one of such gatherings? The way you sang and the enthusiastic participation of the crowd was just captivating. I have total confidence that you are not going to answer. Having said that, I don‚Äôt know you or have not heard of you. But since some platform have given you an opportunity I‚Äôd say: spread love, spread love, spread love. We all need it. The world needs it. Baki, you will find your way, when life gets you. Take care. People need You. Okay no jokes. Seriously. How does it feel being the new chocolate boy everyone swoons over?? Cuz at this point its like Amir in the 90s. this was so cute! i wasnt too into Anuv Jain before, just heard the few songs (loved them) recommended by my frens who are fans but this AMA was so cool, Anuv Jain is definitely someone i would love to be friends with, and as someone who cannot separate the art from the artist i will be joining this fan train heh. Would you ever collaborate with prateek kuhaad? Hey anuv, attended your concert last December and am still so amazed by it. Thank you for sharing your raw and real emotions with us. <3 Is it ever difficult sharing such personal songs with the world? You have an emotional connection to them and seeing them being scrutinized by others is probably difficult at times. Hey anuv, attended your concert last December and am still so amazed by it.

You have an emotional connection to them and seeing them being scrutinized by others is probably difficult at times hi, your songs are so beautiful, can you please come to Bangalore soon also also how do you dead with artists block(it‚Äôs like a writer‚Äôs block) hi, your songs are so beautiful, when will you come to Bangalore also also how do you deal with artists block(it‚Äôs like a writer‚Äôs block) Hi Anuv! Not sure if anyone has asked this yet XD. Do you have any singers/ songwriters who inspired you to enter this field? Can you give me a rough process of how you write songs. My vocabulary is decent but i still have trouble writing songs. Can you please make one song which is not sad ,not about breakup/ love , not about feeling low or disappointment, but a happy song we have no enemies. Broo am I late? Love your voice...Gul and Baarishein are one of my favourites! In this era of auto tuning your voice is the real deal. Thank you for those masterpieces. I missed it üò≠ Manifesting you no more regrets + more and more happiness ü§ß Bro Istanbul mein show kab karoge Can I try writing music? How should I start? How do you begin your songs? What is the first line that comes out and what inspires it? I am a new songwriter and will have 4 songs on Spotify by the end of June. RS How you got into music were you God gifted or trained , bathroom singer or family function star has heartbreak made you make deep songs just need to know your story that resembalates your music !! Hey man, love your music, I read on this thread that you like watching anime. I have a friend who I think is your biggest fan ever and I'm tryna take her to watch the movie \"your name\" this week. She's a bit skeptical about the whole thing tho. It would be great if you can comment back to give her that last push because she would kill a person if you said so. Thanks a tonne and all the best for all your future projects Agar toote makan gir kar waise bante nhi hai toh bante waqt hi Ambuja cement use kariye Jain sahab taki makan ke tootne ki naubat hi na aaye Why did this post get recommended to me if I live in america I had 2 of your songs in my favorites list and my favorite genre is pure Hindi lyrics because that is a missing genre. Your lyrics with EDM or electronic music will give me literal orgasm. Any plans? BTW Anuv which school you from in Ludhiana? Hope you write a song on finding your own Vinland in the future I wonder you still here?!! Just a quick reminder. Stay happy and keep smiling like you always do. And know that you are so much loved! I'll be happy if you read this. Bruh your music is awesome. Spotify told me I was one of your top 0.5% listener. Dunno why it was so damn specific with the 0.5. üòÇ Keep on doing what you do brother. Mate, baarishein .. thank you, this one gets to me , it hits that zone where I easily and effortlessly drift away humming, teary eyed, melancholic, mournful. the song starts and i end all over again. Everytime. PS: it also helps. How could I forget alag aasmaan. I came across Barishein when I was going through something difficult, and it helped me heal. Still on a bad day, I turn to Gul, Alag aasman, Mishri. Your music, your voice is soothing to so many and the way you talk about love is comforting. I came across so many negative comments in this thread, so I just want to tell you are connecting to so many people through your songs around me, and anybody who doesn't feel like that shouldn't bother you either. Thank you for existing. ‚ô•Ô∏è When do you plan to learn more than 5 chords? How is the journey? Did you enjoyed it ? A big fan here , following you for 5 yrs..ü§ùü§ù Sach Sach bol, you did all off this, the music the career all of it just to mine karma haina haina I love playing your songs. Heartbreak yes, but there is no much hope in your voice and words that I am left with optimism after listening to those. Great job you do. When will you come to Ayodhya(Uttar Pradesh)? And will you give free tickets to students (or not keep it too expensive for students) || Maybe I am your youngest fan ever (that's why I am asking for a favor)~~ Have you ever fall in love with an virtual character ~ Hey Anuv, will you please come to Chennai(asks with puppy eyes) Please make songs more like Maula :) it is so beautiful:) What gave you the inspiration to write your first song? Getting a comment from you feels absolutely unreal! Okay so the question is what helped you get over your darkest phases in your life? Also, what's your favourite indie song from a different artist? Great to know you're a tennis fan. Alcaraz, Sinner, Rune, who's your favorite of the *possible* next Big 3? Hi Anuv, I am away from Indian Indie scene, but discovered you on Spotify, and your song Mazak is just brilliant. From what age have you been playing and writing music and who are your influences? Anuv how do you create and publish music as an independent artists? How do you sing so melodious song with not so ryming words I want to be a songwriter in Bollywood. What would be the procedure to make it big and how much time would it take? I really love your song Oceanüôå‚ù£Ô∏è Hey Anuv! I just wanna say thank you so much because your songs have been there for me when no one else was. Your songs have healed me more than anyone else has. I wish you all the best in your life and I hope you reach many manyy more heights cus you deserve it. <3 Hey Anuv ! I want you to know that i'm in love with alag aasmaan and i listen to it almost everyday before i sleep. hey anuv.....i jst wanna know how you got into songs......and what was story behind writing antariksh Hello Anuv, your songs are really awesome and I have introduced many people to your songs. How have you started your music journey and when did you decide to become a songwriter full-time? hey What inspires you to make such good songs i mean sometimes when I'm down and that the thought of just giving up then suddenly that- \"KHALI GHAR TERA YE CHABIYON KI GOONJ AISE TUJHE DARA RAHI TU DARNA NHI MAI HU YAHI PAR\" strikes hard when things get worse and they come back and again go then that-\"TERI KAMI TAB UNKO MEHSOOS HOGI\" makes me give a sigh of relieve. When the will to go any further dies then you make it all worth it. Thankyou for doing so- No he's the one who produces the singles on YouTube and Spotify What‚Äôs your fav Netflix show? How did you got into singing? What was this biggest struggle you had to face while getting into singing This questmay weird you out but why love songs? There are other types of songs aswell? Did you parents ever forced you for pcm/pcb? Weird question but why guitar? Hey Anuv, do you Like thriller/horror because from what you write some would assume you‚Äôre rom-com person but I personally feel like you LOVE HORROR movies. Do u? Sounds like a Pokemon name. Apne makan ambooja cement se q nhi banaye?....toot te hi nhi. I love your voice so much that I named my new born Anuvü•∞ I don't speak or understand Hindi but loved and still love listening to Gul and Baarishein - feelings connected beyond languages do a concert in Kolkata please i beg üò≠üò≠ Your song Mishri brings back memories of my Mom.Thank you for that! If your bestfriend was ugly, and it was his special day (wedding or birthday), would you randomly mention that to him, even if that's the truth? You'd be a dick. I hope you get it Haha, owned him. I missed the AMA, but you're good, man. What's ur favorite anime? In a parallel universe if u weren't singer, then whom do u think u would be? Hey I've still been a big fan of yours till now, and your song baarishein and gul has hit me a lot to reality those lyrics are relatable.

Was Gul driven by your past relationship? Music > lyrics change my mind Hi Anuv, the way your lyrics make me feel, I feel that if a guy ever felt for me as deep as your lyrics are I‚Äôd marry him and never lemme go. Whenever I hear your music, I feel like packing you in a bag and taking you everywhere w me. Why is your music so amazing, plis sing moreüò© Thank you for doing this AMA. This is what got me into your music. I have been listening to your music non-stop. I am kind of depressed and most feel-good songs bring tears into my eyes, but not your songs, your songs make me smile. I love the feeling of feeling lighter after each iteration of listening to your song. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. nai re, andaaz which he threw on from sitting on that \"tree\" being an indie artist yourself, what are your thoughts on the emergence of new indie artists in india? Can you please share the story / inspiration for your songs. Particularly for alag aasman and mishri. I love your music and more than that your writing. It feels like you are telling a story you don't want others to know about. Which eventually leaves room for interpretation by the listener and adds mystery to it. <3 Please do a live concert in delhi. I so wish to attend yours. You're such an inspiration anuvüíå the day you replied to me on your live , it just made my day(18.5.23) . Thank you for existing üò≠ . You deserve it all‚ù§ as someone who was in that jindal crowd, the entire concert was an AMAZING experience! surely it was way too crowded, but since i got to see you perform live for the first time, i became a whole air conditioner after this!!! i heard your songs on spotify and i liked them a lot, but i never expected seeing you live one day! too bad we couldn't meet in person but i still enjoyed it. you indeed made an impact to the audience whoever was there, at least on me! thanks so much for coming! hope to see you live once again (and maybe meet?) Have you heard the remix of your song snap x baarishen and how do you feel about it? Love your music. Used to listen to Ocean on repeat at one point üíô I have been analyzing your songs composition wise, rythm wise, and lyrics wise. Can u share some technical tips how do u compose. What are the conscious decisions other than the inspiration for the song itself. Bhai, ye makaan toote tumhare, wo firse bane kyu nahi?, skill issue hai kya? What are some of your favorite songs right now?? Public mein jaana kitta hard ho gya hoga nhi, neeche wali dukan se dahi nhi mangva skte honge.ü•π Oda aap? I loved Mazaak man honestly, waiting for more like that! yeah man, we're not democracy for nothing! Nothing to ask you ...

I know its hard to believe, but I hear your soul stirring songs while doing a heavy workout almost daily. It‚Äôs almost something like an illegal motivation and steroids. Ya, your songs are steroids for soul.. There I said it. Awesome!! TLT is almost deformed. Raman started his own thing, which is good music again. Other members are not seen for a while, but let's hope they'll too come up with a bang. Seeing TLT live including Raman was one of the most beautiful experiences for me, sad that it's not going to happen again. The house in your song mazaak has the same name as your house , arya His house name is arya , and in song mazaak when they both were standing outside the house .. it was also named arya toote makan... üè°üèóüíîüíî When will you have a concert in mumbai?
