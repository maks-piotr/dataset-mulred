        "The problem is even if you say kick Modi out the states with in-grained militant vegetarianism are not going to change their dietary habits, until and unless say you get an other end of extreme I.e. a progressive dictator who mandates eggs and meat for every child..!!",
        "It's atleast a start :) \nAnd hopefully a dictator is not required. TN, KL, Odisha and TG level is still an improvement.",
        "TN, KL, and Odisha are the states were traditionally meat has been consumed by majority and also the non-meat eating communities aren't actually the dominant ones in terms of wealth or land holding. However, in states like Gujarat and Rajasthan it's the non-meat eating mercantile communities that hold too much of prominence due to their wealth.",
        "Yup :( unfortunately, they control a lot of wealth and power in the center too, affecting states that don't have a problem with meat. Taking back that would be a start. As for Guj and Rajasthan, health awareness and center policies should help in a couple of generations hopefully. At least on eating eggs and fish.",
        "We get rid of Modi, what's next hold guns to their heads and ask them to eat meat? What has Modi got to do with what people eat. This post is dumb let the vegetarians die of naturallyÂ ",
        "Govt (Modi) controls policy, like giving eggs and meat to children in mid day meal programs. I understand respecting the choice of people who don't want to consume meat. They should be provided alternatives. But the vast majority of Indian children eat eggs and meat. And they are suffering from stunting due to the current govt's aversion of meat (due to their RSS/Isckon and jain influences). We should kick out Modi before they continue (and maybe worsen) this vegetarianism imposition on kids. \n\nI still remember the days when govt used to promote eating eggs everyday, and fish for pregnant women. All I see in govt nutritional advertisements are millets nowadays. Millets are not an answer to the nutritional deficiencies in India. \n\nThese children become the future citizens of our country FFS. We should take back our nutrition before radical vegetarians completely take over our plates."
