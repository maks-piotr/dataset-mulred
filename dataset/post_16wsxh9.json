I have seen the poor English communication skills in these IT firms and god knows it's painful to watch them struggling with even a basic expression. Not shaming anyone here but apparently that's the harsh reality. They quickly latch on to hindi in such circumstances, But that's where the problem starts with candidates from southern parts. They might not be fluent in hindi (nothing wrong with that though) thus there is always a  communication barrier. \n\nIt's unreasonable discrimination nonetheless and should be reported/name-and-shamed however I think it's a good thing they wrote such a requirement publicly since  any sensible person would stay away reading this shit and use their valuable time in applying places which could be worth their aptitude.",
        "I am not completely denying it but there's a high chance they want Hindi/Gujarati speaking candidates because in Gujarat people prefer them over other language speaking people. South Indians don't face any discrimination here Of course there can be few exceptions but most of the 99.9% happily live here. They've assumed South Indians mean English speaking public and that's the general perception of South Indians in Gujarat.",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Saw this on Twitter. Company is based out of Gujurat. Remote work.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Time to report them. I didn't even read wholly and assumed it was Gujarat and I was right. There was a recent video of two old Gujurati men discriminating against a Marathi lady. I don't even know why discrimination between north and south makes any sense.similarly I have seen northies(specially people from Bihar,up) being discriminated against in south.like aren't we a part of a single country what exactly is all this hate for Call out the CEO And the HR public Shame them that's the right way to deal with these racist assholes hr and content writer Shame them assholes on linkdin. Bunch of thieves who probably don’t want to pay fair wages to qualified people. At first, I thought that's atrocious. But then I saw it's Gujarat. And everything made sense. Even the idea of HR and content writer requiring 8 years database and cloud experience. Everything from Gujarat, from an illiterate PM to a hiring post, is problematic and horrible. This state's state of mind needs to be better. Ideally, much like the trashy thinking in this post, even Gujarat's way of thinking should be \"reported\" and \"called out\". I'm aware of it. Gujju company! What do you expect? The most vile racist, casteist people in the country. Instead of South it should be Andhra/Hyderabad The horror stories of the fake profiled cheating candidates from that area is a real nightmare. They even have a massive network of support for these fraudsters who help each other once they set their foot in. South of what? Ghaziabad? Really? Can you shed some evidence on your claim where job posts from south say no Bihari or UP? Han to galat kya he B.S South Delhi? Southern hemisphere? Soon Gujarat will be a capital or separate nation. What will be the possible reason given for that 😂. The hiring team consists of an HR/ content writer. Read the header. He mentioned discrimination, which can be done in numerous ways. My seniors didn't take all India seats in Gujarat just because of this. And they were form the north. There's too much Gujju-Gujju brotherhood there. Haha. RIP their linkedin. Subjective claim to dilute the seriousness of discriminatory job post. OP, tell us name of the company. hah imagine bangalore companies started implementing that, all the north indian techies living in bangalore would end up becoming construction workers I am not trying to defend the discrimination in the post. Was just pointing that discrimination also happens in the south. Azoca Technologies India I repeat the seriousness of an actual discriminatory job post must not be compared to some subjective claims. If you don’t want to understand the difference then have this subjective response. South is the less racist than north. When you get discriminated in your own country, what else do you expect outside. Well...for Gujarat based company, they would probably prefer hindi speaking candidates.. so may be that's why... arent many of these companies run by north Indians? Satya Nadella is from Hyderabad too. So are thousands of engineers that created multiple products in tech. If you were to argue that a whole state be blacklisted in tech, because of few fraudsters, maybe we should blacklist Gujaratis in business/politics too. Based🗿 Gujarat: Naam hi kaafi hain. Obviously that's what North Indian imagines in their fantasy I am from the south and have been living in Delhi for a while now. The only people I have seen discriminating against Bihar/UP are the folks from North; south gives no fuck if you’re from Bihar or Uttarakhand. And their Google Reviews The best devs are from the South. Enjoy mediocrity Wow! Never thought of this! We discriminate among ourselves and still call ourselves unity in diversity..🥲 My sister recently settled down in Chennai due to her job .she had a lot of problems in finding a proper house.many times being denied due to being from north.i myself live in vit vellore currently and faculty gives special treatment to students who speak tamil.at one instance in my friends class the teachers gave more marks to a south girls while refusing the same marks to my friend from up.these are just a few incidents.one time my friend was not allowed to collect my clothes due to some rules but the moment he started to speak Tamil the chota dhobi guy gave him clothes in an instant.i have experienced a lot of such incidents in the past month.this is happening when half of campus is from north then I don't know what happens outside where the north demographic is very less They have had a lot of success dividing people and reaping the benefits. Ah no wonder from where our pm belongs In that case, they could have simply put that the job requires the candidates speak so and so languages, for example, Hindi. He is the role model for every crooked, vile, racist, gujju across the world. Gujju hero! Yea, like narindhar mishra, founder of Infosys right? Ok, I won’t call it discrimination directly. Mostly because maybe they want someone who can be comfortable with. In one way what they are doing is horrible but they deserve to have their own choices. Koi sense hai iss baat ki.... Kuch fraud logo se poora andhra/hyderabad ko badnaam karoge... 14-16% of indians residing in America are Andhra people, agar fraud hai toh itne recruitment kese bhai.... Hasham premji Wipro Anand Mahindra tech Mahindra Fc Kohli and jrd tata TCS No wonder. You are just a kid. What you have shown are life experiences that you’ll face anywhere you go outside your home. Wait until you find a job in an MNC you’ll understand the amount of ganging up and discrimination. The “unity in diversity” slogan died with us 80s kids, I suppose. Who knows maybe it’s just a transition phase and hopefully the future generations will be more united. Peace ✌🏽 United to descriminate each other Racism invented in India😂 Some isn't all, my G. yes thats why i said many not all, my G Isnt this racism and generalizing a whole state? To whom? Genuinely, whom do you report these people to? The irony is that you generalised everything from Gujarat, is that that racism too? Go look up racism. Such assh#les should be sued Wow! What the absolute fuck!!!! prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized. Notice the \"community\", and while I'm sure there are exception, the vast majority of gujarati's are exactly as described. Calling them out is not RACISM. This should be must report. No company should do that. Educated wise less fuckers at office. i might have an actually \\*logical\\* explanation for this its no secret that hyderabad and other south indian states have the most amount of fake interviews, where the guy giving the interview (which is mostly on line) and the guy working is different, or the guy is same but the interview is lip synced, or any other method you can think of. point being the company ends up hiring and payrolling a guy who can barely speak english and doing literally nothing. So its \\*possible\\* that this was the reason why they put no candidates from souht. This is of course way too much but ive heard of companies just straight up rejecting CVs if theyre from hyderabad or smth idr When it's 21st century but Aryans vs Dravidians is still going on. I am sorry but do people in India think of the southerners as inferiors? Why is there that discrimination? Good for you Being a Gujarati, I’m ashamed of this behavior shown by some people. Fuck that company, they don’t deserve you fam Generally bigots like to think of themselves as superior to people different than them, but it's actually just fear and unwillingness to be open to anything unfamiliar. Do you think there is logic to discrimination? How bad is it? (Asking genuinely) Indians discriminate against each other and act like it's okay. And then whine and love to play victim even at the slightest discrimination they face outside. 💯 Well, got a query tho. South meant South of the City ryt? Or South of their office building? Or South of the street , for that matter ? Should have mentioned that whoever is aspiring should be good with using Compass 🧭. 😁 If you're denying racism against UP/Bihar peeps in South India then you're living under a rock , South Indians know that they can't do shit to rich Northies living there ,hence they prey on poor workers who are barely making their ends meet. It is what it is So true.. indians who think casteism is okay shouldn’t complain about racism. To whom? I literally have seen the exact opposite too though. And.. Bangalore would go back 50 yrs.. Natives would go back to farming.. I have seen quite a few job postings like this, where they say \"Only from specific region/city are required\". I am never able to discern what their hiring logic is. Mudi Adani It might be because of language barrier. Not racism Pray tell, how do South Indians 'prey' on innocent poor UP/Biharis? Why hide the company name? They need to be exposed and shamed Unko todi todi indi aati😶 I hated my English curriculum in std 12. NCERT was slightly better for the sciences. That's textbook discrimination. Haha That's how it starts. If you get sick eating at a hotel that you were regular at for years, would you still go back there? It's common enough that most of Big companies have no AP profile policies in place. I am all game for blacklisting Gujjus. That's how you bring changes not by ignoring for being politically correct. But by highlighting it to curb it at grassroots. Ah so 🤦‍♂️. I'm from the south. My comment is probably why they don't want anyone from the south lol. India is infamous for its scammers. So you want ppl in other countries to post on their linkedin abt rejecting candidates from India? I don't know about their work politics bro,sorry I interpreted your comment in wrong way.. But my friends who are IT professionals say that they are very smart in tech field so I commented that... Iam from medical field, May be iam not that qualified to talk about IT field.... Do you want to here something ironic? This is a probelm with a lot of new age startups, They operate from Bangalore and refuse to hire people from South. Blanket - obviously this is wrong But discrimination is more widespread than Gujarat or north vs south My dad worked for a small private company, they wanted to hire an HR. The owner asked to put an ad in the newspaper mentioning only male candidates apply. My father had to beg & plead just to remove the line from the newspaper as it could legally backfire. After that the interviewers were strictly told no women hires. (Atleast this company showed its true colors so anybody with half a brain would avoid unlike 1000s of companies covertly discriminating) Ps that was a joke^ . Discrimination is rampant everywhere & is extremely backward & pathetic. Especially coming from so called \"educated\" people More south = darker and darker skin. Ironically the south is better off than the north. Irony is that You are also performing racism by doing this comment I guess , it may be cuz of the Language barrier. They could've framed it differently. It really is coming out as racist and HR+ company should be called out for it. To the RAF ( Racial Administration Federation ) 😝 Idk it was enough for him to Opt himachal instead of Gujarat for ortho. He was from Bihar. Irony in comment section , no wonder india is most racist country I see. What’s the difference between workers from the north and the south? Make a viral Linkedin post . It here It Will hurt Most !!! But why name is hidden in OP post ? Aisi companies ko toh nanga karna chahiye public mai !! Lol, calling out a racist is not racism. Go look it up Calling out a community is not racism Go look it up. Making excuses of racism and xenophobia is however just disgusting Exactly. So we don't have any authority to whom we can report it. In that case, why wouldn't they do this. Bingo !! You know what, I think you guys should do it. Go on, “punish” us by leaving. We’ll see if Bangalore burns or not Thats illegal and also against LinkedIn guidelines. Report. There is no framing it differently. English is used a corporate language. You are just racist like the HR team. Well so it's obviously wrong but instead if they did such discrimination behind the doors it would have wasted Candidates' time so I guess it's good that they put out a banner saying we are shitbags. Bro, thank you for assuming. I am not racist. I was just asking! N I don't give a crap about the HR team of this company they are definitely not it. And believe me even if English is a corporate language, I am facing racism myself here. All the people here speak in Marathi in the office and I'm just there clueless. Ya the way I’ve heard Paytms CEO hates Bengalis. Gajab racism Here post is about one particular company and you straight up commenting about whole state , isn't it generalizing sir , i may wrong How does it matter since the work profile is remote? Huh? People actually do that openly? 🤡 Dude most south people can’t be bothered to know the difference between Bihar and UP. You really think they’re going to discriminate based on a state? Unity in diversity but the \"unity\" is silent Tbf, not South but Maharashtra has a huge problem with people from UP and especially Bihar. They're blamed for all the problems that the working class in Maharashtra faces. This isn't even a \"only those from villages and backward areas are hateful.\" The rhetoric exists almost universally in Maharashtra. The rich are exempt from the hate, it's the poor and the workers that are breaking their backs everyday that face the brunt of it. \"They'll have you fighting a war amongst yourselves to make sure you don't see the class war they're waging on you\" Yes because people from the south have evolved to not know Hindi at all /s Well, I am generalizing. However with where the state has gone since 2002, the hatred the state breeds and the comments most gujju's make and the things they do. I'm willing to wager, there willl be few exceptions to that statement. That is true. People always try to battle bigotry with bigotry Yes mate. Please punish us. We’re longing for this punishment from the last 15 years. Buddy you didn't just call out a community. You did counter racism. That's not how calling out works They didn't say \"candidate must be proficient in Hindi\", you know, the same way that they mention \"candidate must be proficient in English\" This is very in-your-face racism Anyway I don't want to waste my energy here , you may be right 👍 Lol wtf is counter racism? Is it like counter terrorism? Or did you just make that shit up. RD Sharma is better than RS Aggarwal 😡😡 I am a textbook discriminator The G community sees everyone tbh. South Indians, other religions, other castes, other linguistic groups and what not. I wonder if the individual cells in their body also see each other as lesser. It’s since been edited. I guess this woman got all the love, and more - she’s sharing her Instagram posts on LinkedIn. Bro its okay you don't need to apologise for anyone. You didn't do that. Any Indian is capable of that so it's ok I didn't even stay in a North Indian state ever, but the 4 years of my childhood in Pune saw the so much of ridicule and bullying from my dominantly north Indian classmates and maharashtrians who joined in on it. Not just me but any other south Indian. That really impacted my self esteem and social skills for a long time. I was always afraid of getting pejorative comments and unfair social treatment simply because I happen to be from a state that is in north India. That fear of other people carried on even when I went back to south India. But of course, not all north Indians are this way, its just a few of them who think that it's okay to be rude and look down on normal people who simply happen to be from one of the southern states. Yes right, one should be absolutely Politically correct when addressing bigotry, racism and xenophobia. I haven't forgotten what was said and done by the Gujju in Gujarat in 2002, I can recommend a fairly recent documentary to jog your memory, if you so choose? I can also post pictures of gujarati's garlanding the rapists and murderers of naroda patriya? There is a fairly long and very comprehensive list somewhere. I'm sure you get the gist. Shame them on LinkedIn . Call out the ceo . Yeah like Imagine thinking Gujarat is better than Kerala. 🥱🥱 🥱 Should have shared the company name added review 😙 I am a South Indian. The ones from West, North and Central India ( States that fall under Hindi belt )are racist to north east and southerners (majority). It stems from the fact that on average a south Indian is of brown to dark brown skin color and north easterners resemble / have mongoloid features. The people from Hindi belt have some admixture in their genes from Indo-Europeans / Greek / Persian. This is all apart from the fact that the south does much better on many HDI aspects than them. Serious question, does all of India not like the South? Are we considered inferior for some reason? What's behind this? Ancestry test do show it is true. What needs to be stopped is discrimination Id get it you mentioned any northern state but guj really? We're doing fine This is just sad . Yeah. Must be reported. There should not be north-south. It's bad for the country. Sure but then you’re people come to Canada and discriminate with who you choose to rent to. Cant win em all Skin colour (people from south have darker skin) and the fact that south Indians are very likely to not know Hindi. review platform will just remove it if it detects brigading. Pick a random day on the calendar and set a reminder for yourself to post it. Fine in what lol. It's a backward af state Mississippi of India there's literally 0 logic, there's no skill difference (funnily the tech capital is in south India). Yeah this is just stupid petty racism But they are thinking about something, otherwise they wouldn’t write ‘no one from southern India’? Before you blow it out of proportion and frame these guys for spreading communal hate and call them racists there's a very simple logical explanation for this sometimes language barrier is a big problem maybe they just want to avoid that I don’t think “mongoloid” is the word you were looking for 😆 Mate, half the south Indians wont be able to locate Bihar from Orissa if given a map. I have lived in Kerala and Karnataka; none of us knew that Bihari’s were considered second class here up north. But in Delhi I see this petulant hate for Bihari’s from day one, even among government officials. Even UP guys can’t seem to stop taking a dig at a Bihari now and then. Not really. Once you go to the South, the Northerners get treated as inferiors. The country issa bit weird. They just rebrand it to the problem of language in the South, but even the policemen in the South are openly discriminatory against people from other parts of India. Naam likha hua toh hai.....Azoca Technologies I am ignorant about this so Ill just ask, is the south poorer than the north part of India? Maybe it is because that too Well it's doing well economically. If guj is backward then wtf is my bengal lol HR and content writer- company was a red flag before they did this i am a textbook discriminator zindagi mera gaaaana these guys would be the same ones hiring html developers. Dont fret, these guys are not tech literate enough to differentiate between a good dev and a bad one. We'll just make it easier for SEA people to get work visas, those who'd do jobs better than many bīṁār̥ūś and also not bring caste and religion in the workplace Lol white landlords discriminate rent the most. Go into any european subreddit and search \"Renting as a foreigner\" But it's OK to tax the south so that BIMARU states can stay afloat. r/linkedinlunatics South Indians are darker and there are different languages. Lots of racism based on skin color and/or language differences. Yeah, I know there’s some (or a lot?) of discrimination based on skin color, I saw a documentary on skin bleaching.. Not cool. But isn’t language a valid thing? Lol try implementing if you have guts 😂 . Banglore will shut down South is definitely richer than north lol HR name ? If language was the reason they could have just added \"Fluent in hindi or whatever language they need\" instead of banning all people from South Yeah, I have to agree with you on that one.. Could have been a requirement under ‘Must have skills’.. South and East needs to secede from Indian hindustanis, like Bangladesh seceded from Pakistani hindustanis. I'm from Hyderabad, and did my Bachelors in Gujarat. I wouldn't say I had a bad time at all. There definitely seemed to be a lot of misinformation or ignorance where people would ask me if we celebrate Diwali or if we did certain things a certain way when we were not so different after all. There were a few incidents, however, where my friends told me that a few people were sniggering about my skin color while I was giving a presentation but it never reached me directly so I didn't really bother. There is always an underlying cause for discrimination. Actually they can do location based discrimination. State govt do it too. Amazon did it once too. Rejected all candidates based outside of Kolkata. We don't have laws regarding this. But not logic > There were a few incidents, however, where my friends told me that a few people were sniggering about my skin color while I was giving a presentation but it never reached me directly so I didn't really bother. … I have trouble imagining this happening in a college. exactly, when in north discriminate south when in south discriminate north south is richer How? Someone living in the south can always relocate to Gujarat. Battling bigotry with even more vile bigotry. Lol, the irony is palpable. 0 self awareness. Of course it's from Gujarat Uno reverse card Normally south people tend to be racist to people from northeast too. I myself am from south and I see casual racism everywhere. There's a reason why they don't want candidates from the South. Don't consider everything to be racial discrimination. Most South Indians can't speak Hindi and in Gujarat Hindi is a second language and English is not spoken by most of the public. So, it's due to the language barrier because most of the Gujaratis tend to communicate in either Gujarati or Hindi even with employees of their companies. It's not like they consider South Indians inferior in fact they value them highly. The general impression of South Indians in Gujarat is that they are highly educated, english speaking population. No one is discriminating against them. There's a reason why they don't want candidates from the South. Don't consider everything to be racial discrimination.

No one is discriminating against them. Then it should have said language requirement: hindi A lot of South people speak hindi. Stop pretending like it's not discrimination! it mostly due to their english accent. very hard to get their accent specially for clients. Oh no... Azoca technologies is the first A in FAANG. This will be a big loss to South Indians. Southies must give up their idlyvadasambar and eat chappati and change their names from Swamy to Amit. Try to appease Azoca and get a job. /S Imagine if companies in south India do this I've stayed there, I have friends from South India. No one has faced discrimination here. The only issue they've faced is language. So, Most of the Southies speak India, whoever does a job or something. It might be their mistake that they directly wrote it instead saying that they want Hindi speaking or Gujarati speaking candidates. And I am just saying that there's a high chance that whatever I wrote is the situation because Gujaratis do prefer Hindi and Gujarati speaking candidates over other languages speaking. > highly educated discrimination because you are educated... hearing this for the first time. Gujarat Model never fails to surprise me. I am fluent in Hindi because I grew up in Delhi. They could have mentioned hindi language proficiency required. What they did is discrimination Ofcourse,a fat poo Punjab,Haryana whore C'mon dude I clearly mentioned that there's a high chance they want/wanted Gujarati speaking or Hindi speaking candidates. In Gujarat very few people speak good English other than that everyone speaks Hindi at least. There are many South Indians staying here in Gujarat who are happily living here. Only problem they've faced is the language barrier which they've also overcome. It's based on Kundinatika state. That's why she got bothered by interacting with ugly short Kundigas and tried to blacklist all of South India. Everyone thinks all of South India is like disgusting low IQ Kannadigas who bathe with cow dung and eat on floor. if anyone's interested in the real reason for discrimination, I have a theory. In my experience, it had to be the language issue. I have seen the poor English communication skills in these IT firms and god knows it's painful to watch them struggling with even a basic expression. Not shaming anyone here but apparently that's the harsh reality. They quickly latch on to hindi in such circumstances, But that's where the problem starts with candidates from southern parts. They might not be fluent in hindi (nothing wrong with that though) thus there is always a communication barrier. It's unreasonable discrimination nonetheless and should be reported/name-and-shamed however I think it's a good thing they wrote such a requirement publicly since any sensible person would stay away reading this shit and use their valuable time in applying places which could be worth their aptitude. I am not completely denying it but there's a high chance they want Hindi/Gujarati speaking candidates because in Gujarat people prefer them over other language speaking people. South Indians don't face any discrimination here Of course there can be few exceptions but most of the 99.9% happily live here. They've assumed South Indians mean English speaking public and that's the general perception of South Indians in Gujarat. Oh please. Don't give me this \"but you're also being hateful\" nonsense. Hating Hitler wasn't a bad thing. Calling out a narrow-minded state and the retarded politicians from there rACiSm. So, please. Shut it. There are quality engineers from most of the places. AP is well known for fraudsters though. It's common knowledge among IT folks that one needs to be extra careful while interviewing them. Yeah. Atleast then local Govt bodies can take relevant action. Someone needs to highlight it. That's how you resolve an issue. First stage is acceptance. No no, he’s right. Lived in Gujarat till I was 18. Still baffled at how ingrained racism is in many communities, even if you do get people who point this out to others, not many speak up. You could consider my experience anecdotal, but it’s mind boggling when people don’t even realize they’re being racist, even when pointed out. I can count on one hand the amount of people that aren’t racist in some form. And I didn’t even talk about casteism and sexism yet. I’m not gonna argue with other people’s experiences, and if someone had a good experience that’s great. But we are a racist country, saying that isn’t a false generalisation. Same goes for Gujarat There’s really no author in India who at least on paper is supposed to punish discrimination in job postings? Assuming it is actually illegal to discriminate in jobs in India That is very old and dated way of grouping races - Caucasoid, Negroid and Mongoloid. Thank god any of those retarted politicians is not PM , coz open minded and educated India would never vote for them right For this particular Gujrat company example, yes you are right. Maybe they simply don't deserve quality people so they said such rule. As for location based discrimination in opportunity- If you see, any state service commission opportunity, only of native state can apply usually by saying local language req or class 10 req from that state. J&K .. ok leave j&K it's anyway complicated. If you see current on going job opening in Bihar, only women born in Bihar get female seat reservation. Many psu openings prefer local candidates. If you see citizenship CAA again location based difference. As for Amazon case, they said that they only have permission to allow remote inside the city. Hence not taking outside candidate. Very poor reasoning. It's may not be correct but it is being practiced. Then you put the required languages under the already extensive requirements list the job listing has, not say a blanket statement such as this. True but the reality is that I’ve faced it in Hyderabad too. Also from a few marathis I met in the US who give out a “warning” that they have a “racist” joke I actually thought he was gujrati without even looking at comments lol I think it very much was None that can be found with a Google search. I'm pretty sure a good lawyer and a judge will make short work of this as constitution itself has clauses against discrimination. But who is going to take this company to court? Its poor phrasing if they meant location. Like from south sounds like someones background/origin not where they live. If its location, they should have said must be living in so and so states. What?? Southern People tend to think of themselves to be better then anyone from the north, so instead of having a person who everyday will try to publicize and insinuate that south is better then north it is just good sense to have a fellow with right attitude and calm demeanor from north. Apart from feeling supreme, Southern people think that they deserve their own country and are all separatists who don't have any respect for their country and are all disloyal traitors who will turn on India at a moment's notice. Palak Arora Haa phat gayi saalo ki . Thank you 🙏!! South includes men and women Are baba not like that.. North is much poorer than the South. In fact, the South is literally bearing the north financials OK then Hitler This is outrageous ! This is violation of right to equality and is unacceptable. Meanwhile, I am a physiotherapists and I have seen physiotherapy job postings, that openly ask for \"male candidates only \", most of the postings where gender is specified, very few \"female candidates only\". So, basically most physiotherapy jobs tend to be reserved for males, despite our profession being majority female, and that too most of the college toppers in physiotherapy also being female. If you go to the website if bengaluru physiotherapy network and check the job postings, you will clearly see this. This is so unfair and sad. Something needs to be done to end this discrimination. Racism and sexism are dark realities of this country. And this needs to end. First A with 11-50 employees! \"No candidates from south\" in software domain more like - \"we hate growing as a company\" They could have framed it better by saying- candidates must be well versed in Hindi and gujrati Saying no people from South Gujarat is still racism ¿ Basically you're still treating a group of people differently /s This is so stupid. South is a software eng power house. Shooting your own foot by not accepting them. South of what? South of Delhi? Or South of Jammu Kashmir? This is a bad excuse. There are people outside the Hindi belt who have better Hindi proficiency specially in written Hindi. Heck even our Gujrati PM can speak better \"Shudh Hindi\" than some of those with mother tongue Hindi. Lmao North is filled with mern stack developer lol Not particularly good ones. If there is a language requirement then you can state that Uhhhh maybe the job demands you to write code in cow belt hindi, did you think of that? Please dont jump to conclusions all the time where did u heard it? We're all a bunch of racists in varying shades Azoca technologies If you give them the benefit of doubt, it's possible that in their office, the average employee is not comfortable with English and everyone uses Hindi. The average employee from the South is not comfortable with Hindi so this is not going to work out. They could have simply added a condition that applicants must know Hindi and the interview could have been conducted in Hindi to filter out those who can't speak the language but instead they chose the most retarded option possible. It is by no means a simple mistake and their intention is very clear. Wtf people don’t name and shame the company. This is against the labour laws. Economically it is mid table. Socially, Gujjus are the most backward people in India. Have you even been there? Yes jisko bhi preferences ho unko nanga kardena chahiye. There won't be anything 'left' to burn.. I am guessing you are not in india This is a good explanation of why racism exists. Racist person = someone who is scared of people who look different and are unwilling to open to anything unfamiliar. Yeah be racist to gujaratis since you hate modi( i hate modi too) Even worse, Google Maps shows the company is \"Permanently Closed\". Shameful. There is no south north east west, we are all Indians. Seek help dude, you have a mental illness at this stage Little did they know, southern states pay humengous taxes to the central. No Saar My enngalisz good Saar No Problam saar. Because accent? Maybe? Is this not illegal in India? This is nonsense , I am a owner of a software company and I don’t discriminate on the basis of color, caste , age , race , gender , I told my hr what I need and we just look for qualifications and work experience. From south matlab? I am a resident (adhar card holder) in south but born in North. I am not allowed? What makes you think that This is a common myth. Northerners in South tend to behave entitled and don't make any effort to be polite... they get called out, that's not racist. Has anyone seen any posts from companies down south? In my (10y) experience having worked in both places, casual racism is much more prevalent up north (towards everyone, skin color, region, etc.) Whereas down South what most North Indians point out as racism actually turns out to be people calling them out for their own entitled and rude behaviour. Constitution prohibits discrimination by the state. discrimination by individuals/private sector is still legal > No one is discriminating against them. > There's a reason why they don't want candidates from the South I think I see something inconsistent here but maybe you can help me make it make sense. this is in Gujarat, but there was a company which came to my college college in Bengaluru.. they had mentioned \"Must speak Hindi\".. it was a neither a sales role not some other role which needed interaction with people of North India.. it was just another normal software developer role.. and company is based out of Bengaluru lol.. wondering how the work culture is Right..... All those People in Comments cursing, wanting to Report... No one Talks about south when they it🤣 perfect Example Bangalore. As It's A MNC hire they can't control if any one not from south joins there...but they make.life a Living hell. Rents Increase, Policy to even live in home. Any issues happen even police doesn't helps and Deliberately talks local language intimidates you. No complains for that right.. Even though we know whom to complain Yea I have to keep reminding people in Tamil Nadu to keep speaking in Hindi. It was a national university. I would expect English, but I was flexible enough with Hindi. Yea? Just goes on to show your double standards. If it was a thing a Southern person would have said, it may have made sense to you. Just another example of your hypocrisy. You can quote me on this: \"South will definitely try to become a traitor against its motherland, India. But it won't be successful \" Yea same. I was also at a university. They even asked me to learn the language if I don't want \"problems\". You can imagine my fears as a 19 year old kid from the north and being threatened to start speaking the native language. This is the type of thing that you will see only in the south. Yeah, that's terrible. My opinion is that English should be the primary medium of communication and universities should somehow mandate that. Yeah, that's terrible. I think English should be the primary medium of communication and universities should somehow mandate that.fessional setting. There were so many of my friends in Gujarat who struggled in interviews due to their communication skills. That's a kind of event that changes my perspective for a long time. I don't see myself ever going to Tamil Nadu anymore. I will remember this for my entire life. Yea look, I want the north and the south to find common ground. I really do. It would be the best. But it cannot be a language that didn't even originate from our lands. It just can't. you really think the local govt is gonna spend its limited source of money into this shit? when india has a ton of issues? that they are gonna take relevant action towards this instead of discrimination, rape and violence towards women? Seems the opposite tho Imagine South did this to North 😂 Its not like you can concentrate only on murders and ignore everything else. If they are short staffed, they need to recruit more. Yes there are priorities, but there shouldn't be ignorance. Keep ignoring something long enough and it will become unsolvable in future. This lame excuse of let's catch rapists only makes no sense. >This is a common myth. Northerners in South tend to behave entitled and don't make any effort to be polite... they get called out, that's not racist. LOL. I am exceptionally polite, and was only in the South as a tourist. I got stopped by a policeman for doing something 4 other South Indians were doing at the same spot beside me. And this is when I learnt a bit of Kannada because I love languages and want to learn Tamil and Kannada. You have no idea how racist most of South India is. Ask any North Indian friend you have. Do we have laws against such discrimination? Right when our economies do well and we manage to get our population under control, what do we get ? Threat of delimitation meaning our democratic power / representation will be lowered. Meanwhile having to experience racism even when we travel north and learn the local language and yet get ridiculed. And the many northies who come to the south and don't even bother to learn the local language ? Forget that the first word that you use is not even from English, it is straight from Hindi as if we were your servants. Ours is a feeling of love towards our culture under an attack by the centre irrespective of party because of vote pandering to the hindi belt. Because they are hard to understand. Unless they pronounce properly. Lmao the company is permanently closed now Unverifiable anecdotes don't prove your point. It's not really a stretch, a majority of North Indians act entitled and look down on South Indians. Surprisingly, that's the one thing that unites all Indians - fate for other Indians. One of the teams where I work has a South Indian. Most of us can speak Hindi, so most of them speak Hindi amongst each other. He gets excluded since he doesn't understand Hindi, maybe that's the reason. They don't want language barrier to act as a hindrance in team dynamics. They should have just said Hindi/Gujarati is a language requirement na Exactly 🥹. Btw is Gujarat really that racist? I am seeing a lot of comments like no doubt it's Gujarat, as expected Gujarat. Why is it so Checked their website - the founder is Gujarati and there seems to be a diverse team including at least one guy from the South. Lmao, bold of them to assume south folks would even want to work in Gujarat Just looked them up on Linkedin. Are they based out of Gujarat? Basis this posting which does not seem to be there anymore, people from Mumbai too would be \"south\" This ought to be posted on all social media sites. Bigots Sadly, discrimination is the name of the hiring game where hiring managers have HR post jobs where women cannot apply or only for \"unmarried talent\" I mean everything is south ,when your reference is north pole...so you must be hiring polar bears Good luck 🤞 It will be more than fine. You are not that important. Never were. Dear God, I think I had an aneurysm reading this. Idek where this misconception comes from. Bangalore has had a very very rich history even prior to the IT boom. Besides, solving overcrowding caused by you bunny rabbits would, more or less, solve all of Bangalore's issues. Looking at the HR person's apology, this feels like a \"said the quiet part out aloud\" thing. Doubt that this changes anything other than the job posting content. Guys she is Palak Arora and she apologized for it with a selfie of her. Her excuse: she copy pasted her overseas client's message to not include South Indians. And now she said anyone can apply now. Wow. Aaaannndddd.....there it is: \"I copy paste the job description from one of our overseas client. May be he had some bad experience from south indian candidate and so he wrote the same in his job description. In rush I just copy pasted it and hence doing apologise for the same. There is no other intension for posting this post except the apology for the mistake.\" Meh, all-in-all, prefer that these folks post the statement. Tells you a lot and saves time. Southerns are rascist to everyone except themselves We need a Blacklist A friend of mine from Assam got shouted on in a bus in Kerala that don't talk in Hindi this is South, ironically the guy was from Tamil Nadu and a tourist himself, lol Nope but south people are bigoted and racist. Also they do a lot of groupism wherever they go and do not include other people - a complete menace at a workplace. My south indian friends just speak their language and ignore me completely even when they know I don't understand or speak tamil. And we are living in Pune so the audacity of these people! Adding to that list, Kunal Shah ( Cred, Gujju from Mumbai) , Bhavesh Aggarwal ( Ola), Vivek Gupta (Licious) , Dalvir Suri ( Dunzo). Infosys and Swiggy are the only 'local' run large companies in Bangalore. I could sit around and Google the senior management of int'l firms in Bangalore but I'm not gonna do that. Bangalore's tech economy would collapse without people from other states >LOL. I am exceptionally polite, and was only in the South as a tourist. I got stopped by a policeman for doing something 4 other South Indians were doing at the same spot beside me. And this is when I learnt a bit of Kannada because I love languages and want to learn Tamil and Kannada. Lol sure, because you have infinite data and studies available for this? Or perhaps other anecdotes are verifiable cz they are from South Indians? Reddit in India is any way dominated by South Indians, so you might get the upvotes, but what is true remains true. Kunal Shah ( Cred, Gujju from Mumbai) , Bhavesh Aggarwal ( Ola), Vivek Gupta (Licious) , Dalvir Suri ( Dunzo). TCS is owned by Tatas and Wipro isn't South Indian either. Infosys and Swiggy are the only 'local' run large companies in Bangalore. I could sit around and Google the senior management of int'l firms in Bangalore but I'm not gonna do that- anecdotally this will include a large no of Telugus along with North Indians . So no, it is actually YOUR fantasy where South Indians run all the companies, North Indians run a significant number of them, too. Everyone is racist nowadays be it North, South, East, or West. NE hates everyone East ka pata nahi. North hates the South for no reason. South hates the North for no reason, Wait did someone say Hindi imposition?? West ka pata nahi. Update: She has now posted an update on her LinkedIn with her selfie saying it was a mistake and that she believes in Akhand Bharat. How did she get that job? the apology. And in the commens she mentions she copied and pasted the post from an overseas client who may have had a bad experience with a south indian. Not a well thought out lie to cover up discrimination. Lol we don't even want to be important for you chumps . I feel the same about the people from southern parts of India. They're filthy, they don't shower, are abusive and the most racist. The most vile, disgusting breeds. CEO of Microsoft Google Novartis Adobe IBM Starbucks Are all…. You can fill in the blanks Buddy, I've lived in South for 8 years and what you're saying is not true.Atleast in the way you make it sound. Like a blanket statment. > They don't want language barrier to act as a hindrance in team dynamics. Then, \"Candidate must be proficient in Hindi\" would do the trick. Fair could have worded it properly. I was born in Gujarat. Mom is from Bihar, dad is from UP. Before we moved out in 2007 towards the south(Kerala), my parents lived there for almost 14 years. They never had any problems. Infact my dad used to take tuition classes for a couple of Gujarati brothers after he used to come back from his job. My mom was a school teacher when I was born. In general, I personally think living Gujarat was perhaps the best time for me and my family. Same goes for when we were in the south. Shifting to Delhi was where shit kinda started dropping off. I did visit Gujarat as a tourist. And my experience was good. This is a hearsay from my seniors. Or that Bihar is better off than Kerala. Or Odisha is better off than Karnataka. Or Madhya Pradesh is better off than Andhra Pradesh. Or that Uttar Pradesh is better off than Tamil Nadu. I’ve only ever heard it used to describe Down’s syndrome people. Tell yourself what you have to, mate. Bangalore existed long before you guys and will continue to replace you with talent from elsewhere long after you’re gone. Dream on 😂 English is just a language.. anyway, I have seen North Indian people in senior positions pronouncing \"Desktop\" as \"Dextop\".. 🤡 I have no idea why you think you must protest the privacy of these vile animals. Dont hide the name. So funny that they think a person from the south isn’t eligible for the DBA job. People from the south literally run tech in US Your comment is nonsense because i did not make any such definite statement. It is your fellow North Indian brother that is making racist statements. So keep living in your fantasy world 🌎 ok, i just shared what i heard from client. Sure so all the North Indian engineers in the southern states can be kicked out? Or a new rule that North Indians aren’t to be hired? Since this a both sides argument? Shut the fuck up. South Indians do not treat North Indians as inferiors. They react to being treated poorly. Calling us monkeys, n word and n word derivatives all these years and make fun of our culture, movies, language all of these years and wtf are we supposed to do? Ngotha moonjila pooran vitruven Might be the case. Who knows he said 'many', not all. North Indians run many companies and also work as labourers making them indispensable to the economy, and that's just a plain fact Why do Kannadigas bathe with Cow dung,eat cow poop,eat on floor and roll on food items naked and later eat them and have the most number of child pornography cases as per NCRB? Horror stories caused by Kannadigas with their dirty habits are a real nightmare. They even have a massive network of supporting these fraudsters like this Kannadiga begging in Hyderabad Once dirty Kannadigas step inside any Telugu land,everything becomes dirty like Karnataka. Quite the opposite, the folks I've met from south are usually more genuine than most. It's fact Yes but I would suggest to you to not use North / south. It only creates division and tribalism All Indians are racist, some more some less. If you think southerners aren't racist, think again. I am Tamil and we tamils have this sense of big brother attitude with respect to other Dravidian peoples. Like even now people will claim every dravidian language came from Tamil (despite the fact that they came from Proto dravidian, not tamil) and that we are the oldest in the subcontinent (conveniently subsuming all adivasis as tamils too). Of course other southern people will not accept this. So we've branded them all as a mix of tamils and North Indians and end up blaming their love for their language to mask our ignorance. Even Periyar famously called the Malayalees as \"bas****s\" and \"mixed breeds\" just because they didn't associate with his ideologies. We don't like Karnataka (because Kaveri duh) and we don't like Andhra.. why Andhra? Cause they split the Madras State to make their own and how dare they... We completely ignore the Maharashtrians because acknowledging them would mean acknowledgement of Maharashtra's economic success (then how will TN be the best!). For us, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand is all just forests and tribals and mining. And lets not even get started with all the \"Nepali\", \"Gurkha\" and \"Chinese\" we use for people from the Northeast. Just cause we don't blatantly tell it out loud, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Well i do not.....and it came to know this exists after you mentioned otherwise here in Gujarat in city where i live many southerners have hotels and dhaba for south dishes .....i do not find such things here....and myself i do not consider such stuff ...i think it depends from people to people and area wise where they learn stuff....and see stuff... This is the first time I'm seeing such discrimination. Any form of discrimination is unheard of in professional spaces except gender. Exactly, the tone is outright unprofessional and rude. My friend worked at an office of about 100 people in the U.S. where they had to eventually fire most of the South Indians. It wasn't really a race thing but the reason was kind of weird. He said they would shit in the bathrooms by placing both of their feet on the toilet seats and they would leave shoe marks on the toilet seats. Some of them even took off their shoes and would climb up on the seats barefoot. The reason why they would get fired is even more odd. They constantly kept breaking the toilet seats because they would literally squat on them. This was an office with mixed races but there were too many complaints of the bathrooms being unusable because of the smell after they would use it as well. People would literally get nauseous walking into the bathroom because the smell was so bad. Very strange occurrence. It's has become a very common things now South companies people from South or people living there and North companies want people from North indian region. Few of my interview got cancelled as they think I don't wanna come to South. This is bad but we can't do anything in this market. Sahi toh hai Since it's remote job. It sure sounds like a discriminative filter Honestly i haven't seen something so direct in a job description honestly, but if it's true than, his ass needs to be stuffed with khakhra and dhokla woth south indian mint chutney"
