And when we actually cook it, meat toppings tends to lose its juices when cooked at such high temperatures so they are kept under the cheese. \n\nThat said, Dominos is notorious in giving less toppings all over the globe.

Sorry u/SADDEST-BOY-EVER Must be at ur Domino's cause I order this last week and it was full of toppings I mean i could bearly see the cheese I hate big pizza chains like dominos and pizza hut, quality is so poorly maintained, I'd rather suggest going for newly found chains since they'd have pressure to grow Brick oven proudly burns its pizza. So newer chains are not really consistent. But I agree Dominoes and Pizza Hut are shit. Wish Papa Jhons. was still arounf. Bas 1920 ka farak hai, I mean it is possessed Atleast you got cheese.... None of the pizza places in my locality even bother putting cheese i mean... it really looks like a nice pizza, call me crazy but i'd demolish that like some sort of animal, each peice in 2 bites job, you know? the real savage kind, where who ever is in the room with you is never quite able to fully look at you the same again Govt. cut it's portion before it got delivered. Yup. Cheese is replaced with cheap mayonnaise Literally me Be sure to trash them in the feedback link provided and share this on twitter. Btw this is typical big chain cost cutting , try to find local pizza places . They are far better atleast in tier 1 ,tier 2 cities. Do you make your own base too or buy a base? Because making a base is the most time taking task My local dominos is the same. Stopped ordering long time ago.

At least there are a few chunks of even. Ever understood the pain of people who order Pepperoni or Kheema Pizza? Chilli Flakes and Oregano sprinkles are way more prominent than meat in these Pizzas!! Customer bhagwaan samaan hota hai, woh bas Paisa deta hai aur dukandaar apne grahak ko sabak sikhata hai. Bas got to remember this. Humein C*** banne ka shouk hai aur dukandaar ko c**** banane ka shouk hai, that's the only difference mate. The Wordplay is amazing Us moment This is probably a different pizza, you should report it. It does look like a different pizza. No way it has 5 type of chicken toppings. Can see like 2 There you go. 50% off on everything. Be glad they didn't eat half of it. Jokes aside. It's a scam. I paid 900 for a pizza to get something smaller than my dinner plate. I don't know man it kinda looks the same üòï I would love to, but that damn feedback link appears to have an impact on the staff, rather than the company taking it as a feedback to improve their services. Their delivery people have told me multiple times that giving feedback gives them promotion (literally what they said). They have even sent me messages lol. I‚Äôm just scared if they get dealt with harshly from their higher ups. Bold of you to assume that you will get exact food items as shown in figure. Who moved my toppings!! Pizzas in India are mostly a scam with horrible cheese and base. I've found that Dominos in India do not shy away from skimping. Their pizzas are often substandard in flavour, toppings, cheese and dough quality. Even the cheese burst pizza doesn't come with the same quantity of cheese and flavour that it did before Covid. With that kind of quality at the core their prices don't justify any of their products. Think they have taken the customers for granted. Time to find more authentic and better value for money pizzas! I think most people buy a base Maaf karna bhai mujhe bhook lagi thi that's why I nagged some of those hope you don't mind Jai Hind I mean...aren't the staff members the ones who prepared your pizza? Dominoz will never learn Dominos sucks Shadi karogi? Khana bhi mai bnaunga safari bhi karunga. Write a complaint on fssai and consumer forum Man I miss Indian pizzas. Mojo pizza?? Bro 7 years back i bought the meat eater for 600 and ate the whole thing myself. Best pizza I've ever had. Oh yeah ordered the same pizza, was complete trash. But man I have understood that dominos tastes like shit. God knows why people eat from there. I am most likely never ordering from there after spending my 300 rupees in the wallet haha. >safari bhi karunga. Bacche karunga sune the, ye market mein naya aaya hai kya? üòÇ Yes I've noticed the difference. The quality differs by location. Like in tier 3 cities you'll get the pizza with lesser toppings while in a metro city, the same pizza will be baked and topped better. They call it liquid cheese You bought this shit for 500? Safai bhai, typo ho gaya. Pls don‚Äôt buy pizza mania and those 100 rupee meals from domino‚Äôs. Pat the premium and get normal pizzas which don‚Äôt have that horrible ‚Äúcheese blend‚Äù which literally feels like Mayonnaise Ye bik gyi hai gormint!! Abh iss gormint mei kch na raha ye saare milke pagal banare ** ke baache Yeah, been there and this can be surely reported I have gone through all this years ago don't fall for their emotional bs . They are the ones doing the cost cutting at the outlet level , your negative feedback will just expose them to the top management. I started getting loaded pizzas after my nearest outlet got several negative feedbacks . And then they used to call and beg for positive feedbacks or the outlet will close . Ranting or actually complaining whatever works for you i guess . I hope You know Domino‚Äôs , McDonald‚Äôs and some other popular fast food joints don‚Äôt use real cheese Both look appetizing üíØ okay then, no mercy this time. Thanks for this. Didn't know! Dominos. Bah these guys are only good for the pizza mania Plus taxes ~50 In my area there are 4 dominos 2 McDonald's 2 kfc and 4 subways. Exactly 50% outlets for each chain are worth any good. There is a lack of consistency among outlets of same food chain. The outlets that are very busy or very rarely busy are just pathetic to taste. Can anyone suggest me best pizza outlets to order... don't wanna use dominos due to these type of cases Which one? Most bases to buy are terrible Username checks out ü•π huh? Unpopular opinion, but the pizza is decent. The picture is that of a regular-sized pizza, the relative size of the toppings therefore are much bigger and cover a larger amount of pizza while what you have ordered is a large size. the relative size of the topping will obviously seem a lot smaller in comparison. Not saying the picture is 100% accurate but not at all misleading more specifically palm oil, the most inferior type of oil these fast food chains serve us! And roadside ‚Äò paneer‚Äô is not paneer at all Same thing happened with me when I ordered from Pizza Hut Normally it's milk solids with more than half vegetable oils They use AI to generate images nowadays. Zomato uses stock images. That sucks too. Barely any toppings and full of cheese, or maybe I‚Äôm cursed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bhagwan kassam isne toh kat diya ! It does but for 100-110 rupees, the chicken pizzas are alright. It is the pizza you deserve but not the one you need right now. Advertising??? He‚Äôll flat out ask you to not eat this junk!! They missed *Note:* Items in image not to scale It costs 200 now üò≠ Wasn't delivered along with dead rat or severed human finger 10/10 Bro got catfished Pizza mania?? Since when? Just had it 2 month back and it was 110 Bhai domino's is the worst. If you are from Mumbai try Square Pizza. It's the best I remember the days when I used to order the Large Chicken Dominator from Dominos, and it used to come fully filled with Chicken pieces with no compromises. 1000rs pizza you are rich brother üò∂ Idk man, i made pizza at home like once in my lifetime üò≠ that's 4 serves? how many slices can one usually eat before feeling full? I mean, pizza is my favorite food and I usually eat for 3 days at a time so that pizza right there is 2/3 of a day for me ü§£ Tds katta hai sir enjoy the rest Damn it sounds like India needs some better pizza options lol Papa johns is trash Shame 2 shame I know what I'm ordering for dinner tonight. Domino's have no quality control at all. Like AT ALL. And their customer service sucks ass. I've had missing orders and bullshit from them at various locations from before. oh my bad, I confused pizza mania for non-veg loaded. I had a similar experience, on a different app tho. Got something that was wayyy different from the pictures. I was using Tinder. That pizza has a disgusting among of cheese on it. Whattt, matlab me kuch aur hi kha raha tha, protein ke name pw ‚Ä¶ Been tricked same way. But my pizza was far more horrible in presentation and taste. Finally gave up ordering pizza from all such fake look and nonsense taste joints. You met her eh? ü§£üçï üòõSmoking Joe's, When they had started. üòã It looks good, I hate chicken or beef on a pIzza tbh Only peporini for me Poor OP's sentimental and got played by those pizza boys fooled him into giving 10/10 rankings. Check the tax paid in the bill. They always get paid first, as you pay first, even before you're served. Guess the menu of this guy's shaadi. Pizza, the exact same pizza as above. ü§£üçïüòÇ Dominos?? I stopped both same time, once after visiting and seeing how they actually prepare a hand made pizza at Dominoes. Exact same tummy pain and nausea effect. They all use low quality inputs. High advertising and junk fake reviews keep their business rolling. Home made pizza costs one fourth their costs, and tastes ten times better. Looks good > I've found that Dominos in India do not shy away from skimping. Their pizzas are often substandard in flavour, toppings, cheese and dough quality. They're able to do all this because we don't really have better alternatives. Every single alternative pizzeria in my city ends up making even worse pizza slathered with mayo. It can't be that hard, but for some reason no real better options. What is it? Yes. dominos is a scam nowadays, earlier atleast bread was good Ofcourse. I myself haven't had pizza from outside since I got married. The wife makes top tier pizzas that are way healthier. Still, the false advertising from these big fast food chains is extremely manipulative. The pizzas and burgers on their display are way far from what is actually served and everyone knows this. About time for the public to keep this in check. 100%, never ordered pizza hut anyways man, love my pizzas but paying 1000 bucks for it is atrocious, the small ones from anywhere don't even qualify as pizzas. The meat is always old, cheese isn't cheese, it's emulsified mayo or something. Shitty dough and bread. Indian food regulators hardly care. The photos and what's real is a rip off. Specially with the Zomato app AR feature. True. Italians will shit on it...need proper pizza makers in India now that its very popular here It's all cold storage stuff and palm oil. We copying the western lifestyle, that trend ended in their 1970s-1990s, we feel cool copying that lifestyle. They are on fresh foods now, we will adopt that lifestyle in 2050-60s. \"üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏èü§≤\" What does it mean, shaking my head sideways & praying? r/usernamechecksout Yeah, if you have a Tossin nearby then it is a must try, they have maintained their quality since inception. Is this Dominos? It sucks.... I've tried to take my friends to authentic pizza places... But they're used to thick bread + whatever they use for cheese + lucky if you get good toppings.. Being in awe with OP (or it's safe to say OP's humour) is all I wanted to mean üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è stop trying find \"meaning\" of every emoji. Reel vs real life ü§£ Dominoes doesn‚Äôt even use real cheese. Its cheese by products and some mixed mayonnaise like cheese that tastes horrible Best is to make the pizza at home. Where I live, there are some very good pizzerias that serve actual pizza without that fake cheese and mayonnaise crap. Its expensive but once in a while its fun to get good Pizza. > stop trying to find \"meaning\" of every emoji üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è‚ÜîÔ∏èü´®‚¨ÜÔ∏è Yes. My parents and me 98% Pizzerias are scamsters .Better to make your own pizza at home‚Äî more toppings for less the price. coupon de de bhai It ain't Japan bro Bas 19-20 ka farak hai Redeemed already so it‚Äôs useless. better to order from a local but well known area, pizza chains like dominos have low quality food sumtimes, also if u tell where u live i might be able to suggest only downside is that shits expensive You can ask for a refund by filling the feedback form. That's the punishment god gave you because you ordered pizza with chicken Dominos is a scam, I would definitely take it to the shop ask them to make me a new one, trust me they gave me 2 + 1 pizzas üçï for free. ??? wow. They made sure you are living up to your username. /s Bhai pizza meh koi kami nahi hai, Tera lightning aur photography skills meh kami hai ü§£ He‚Äôll do a video on fast foods - don‚Äôt eat fast food. Its probably the worse, most ultra processed bullshit food in the world. Who‚Äôs going to waste time fighting lesser pieces of shit on a big piece of shit. ‚Äúlightning‚Äù Domino's does use cheese with their Pizzas, if you buy their Pizza Mania range or Cheese Burst addon however you get cheese substitute like mayonnaise. Domino's is not hiding this stuff from you. [https://www.dominos.co.in/real-mozzarella-cheese](https://www.dominos.co.in/real-mozzarella-cheese) Kuch nahi hota. I‚Äôve ordered rice bowls from the good bowl in the past and the second time they delivered a rice bowl which had a very small quantity of chicken. I was furious because it almost felt like I had no chicken. Called up the customer care and explained it and all they said was we‚Äôll try to convey it to the restaurant and make sure (how?!) that you have a better experience next time. And gave me some useless amount of points for another platform that I didn‚Äôt even use. There should be regulations which enforce that restaurants are clearly mentioning how much quantity of the major ingredients we are getting. Some restaurants already do that but most not. it's not like local pizzerias don't follow cost cutting methods as well. The only difference I've seen most local places serve foodfire thin crust Pizzas with more or less the same amount of toppings for chicken pizzas for the same price (or sometimes even more). Making pizzas on your own at home requires quite the effort and patience.... From making the dough itself, you need a really good quality oven or you'll end up making the crust into a crispy biscuit on the base and the edges. Making pizza sauce and getting all ingredients and cheese is also a factor. Ordering Pizza can take 20 mins to an hour and most people are going to choose the second option. idk about Keema pizza but I often order their Chicken Pepperoni Pizza when there's a big discount and they've never (ever) sprinkled oregenos in any of the Domino's outlets I've visited here in Goa. They do give generous amounts of oregeno and chili flake packets though. Chicken Sausage is the only topping I've found where they would pre-apply oregeno sprinkles. agreed! I would devour it lol Yes Serves 4? I‚Äôd eat that all by myself on a good day. Although I know I would be downvoted for this but I'll say it anyway. As someone who works in the pizza shop (not in India), the only difference I can tell from the photos as that the toppings are added after cheese in the professional photo. And in reality the toppings are added before the cheese. I'll also add reason why, in professional photo we need to show what type of toppings customer will get. And when we actually cook it, meat toppings tends to lose its juices when cooked at such high temperatures so they are kept under the cheese. That said, Dominos is notorious in giving less toppings all over the globe. I'll only have something from Dominos only if I'm in the mood for double cheese pizzaüòã fuck Domino's has gone from good to worst 19-20 ka fark hai bas Toppings changed ü•≤ Time to make your own Agreed...I currently live in nashik so no good local outlets here but going to shift in pune in months Bro a pizza without cheese is like no Mattar in Mattar paneer üò≠ü§å Well i asked for a fully loaded veg but got corn 2 times but my introverted ass would never argue with them *Processing img yisw82x9k58d1...* *Processing img yisw82x9k58d1...* ‡§´‡•ã‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡•Ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä? ‡§™‡•ã‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ? Still looks delicious That was a rumour, they released a statement that they use real dairy cheese in all pizzas except pizza mania(cheesy mayo in this one) and cheese burst contains a blend of cheddar and mozzarella Idk how true it is but they‚Äôre fssai certified so they can‚Äôt lie on record Still looks delicious Damn the pizza looks dead Same same but different Typical pizza joints lying about sausage girth smh They both look delicious tbh Dude delivery guys didnt fuck up your pizza, but the restaurant workers def did. Why are you considering all the staff the same and shielding the bad ones from blame? Same same but Different.. üòÖü§£ü§° 5 chicken feast? i see none, you got robbed. ‚ÄúLoaded‚Äù lmao where chicken bro is not helping with the 'any app is a dating app if you're Indian enough' stereotype Welcome to reality.. where the reality doesn‚Äôt match the producf It looks better in person I love seeing the different ways the world eats pizza. Bro, the pizza you got looks 100x better than what you ordered. Too many toppings is not a good thing. Look at all that delicious browned cheese. The pizza OP got looks 100x better than the photo. havent lived in either places but yeah im assuming punes gonna have better food choices that's cheap, where is this ? chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken Next time try Lapinoz butter chicken pizza with cheese burst In American that would be impressively close They cost a fortune and they have even stopped tasting good from the last couple of years. You can easily make a better pizza at home. That's why I don't eat out and would rather make it at home. Eating out or even getting it delivered to home is so disappointing. The better option is at home. Its not that hard. Grab a good quality pizza sauce, diced mozarella cheese, oregano and basil from a mall/online grocery store. Grab a whole wheat pizza base from your bakery. 1. Spread a generous amount of pizza sauce on the Pizza Base 2. Add a generous amount of cheese 3. Add a generous amount of toppings of your choice. I recommend Capsicum and Onion. They are classic and give the 'Pizza smell and taste'. If you have more budget then you can even add black olives if you like it. Or you can also add cut sausages 4. Sprinkle oregano and basil on top 5. Put it in the oven for 10-15 mins You will get a 100 times better pizza at 1/4th the price. You can get good quality dough and pizza sauce online. Not an issue. BigBasket has it in my area. I think Blinkit should have it too everywhere Can you recommend some good pizza places? As someone who works in Dominos i can say that u ll not get what u see in the pictures. But yeah ur pizza looks almost a 5* pizza (thts what we call a perfect pizza) tho its missing a few toppings Looks good, still The only thing I can think of is that the photo is of a regular Pizza while you ordered a large(?). So the toppings looks scarce in comparison They still should've added in a bit more toppings though. I only order regular pizzas so haven't faced this issue That's not the same üôÑ I was gonna say the same, the first one seems overloaded nahi 1029 ka farak hai. They‚Äôre the same picture I hate these enterprises . Gotta give the delievery men tip because these companies don't bother giving them enough salary . And now full rating to cover up these companies' flawed ass . Big Basket is only available if you live in Tier 1 cities. There is no bigbasket in Goa so far. There are over 10 Dominos and Pizza Hut outlets and other chains like Lapinoz and local pizzerias are also popping up. It's way easier to just to just buy Pizza from chains that source quality ingredients and do it yourself without fucking it all up. Although Swiggy Instamant and Blinkit does exist here the options for pizza dough isn't available in many tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Aadhar card ahh pizza You just don‚Äôt have the right lighting \\s OP fell for the oldest marketing trick in the book lol. The pizza you got looks so much better I‚Äôm so high I‚Äôd eat that pizza within seconds, then I‚Äôd eat the real pizza. Same toh hai bhai! I am aware of this but I think this varies from outlet to outlet because the outlet in my city barely puts any mozzarella cheese even on regular pizza and it's full of mayo shit Had the same thing yesterday... Same pinch Don't complain the Pizza is skimpmaxxing small light use karigayi hai 5 chicken probably meant 5 pieces of chicken in total. I can suggest in Bangalore.. Where do you stay Which website is this? Doesn't look like Domino's or Pizza Hut... Agree it looks delicious but toppings are significantly less compared to the photo Should have ordered small üòõ >pizza boys fooled him into giving 10/10 rankings. Spankings* Advertisement : loaded with 5 different toppings Reality : loaded with 5 total tiny chicken toppings Yea, my immediate reaction was 'That's how it's supposed to look?' No real pizza is going to look like the first pic. First of all ‚Ä¶ is that even a pizza ?? The feast is for the restaurant from where you are ordering. Qt are you selena gomez , coz I want to make you sing on high notes in pain üòç. Are those local brands? still looks good imo, not everday you see such even browning of the cheese Was the cheese real? I've heard dominos doesn't use real cheese. MMMMJD (Mujhe Mast Mahaul Mein Jeene De) I've heard that the dough size for all pizza sizes are the same. So the larger the pizza you order, the thinner the crust. Is that true? They were also accused of using fake cheese in India years ago, is that still the case? Wrong lyrics mate..it's kuch dard hain mere sene mein not bdsm, then this line... Pta hai bro.. thoda match kiya toh song dimaag me aaya.. toh aage ka likh diya Ok india moment Shittiest thing to put on a pizza ever Why are pizzas in India so expensive? Domino's is a scam. Same same, but different üôÉ I wouldn't know about that and don't have any evidence except for my tastebuds. and what does your tastebuds say about the cheese, feels real? Only non veg loaded is good along with pizza mania onion and Margherita It does require patience and effort but isn‚Äôt that a better alternative to shit pizzas that we buy online? Ingredients are fresh and you know what is going on your pizza. You can get ready made dough now as well. Also, you don‚Äôt need a wooden oven as not everyone has it but if you learn the technique then it comes out well ‚úÖ Making a basic pizza sauce is literally too easy - all the ingredients and cheese is available on zepto, instamart as well. If you're getting mayo on regular pizza you are getting scammed! You paid for the real thing and you're getting a Pizza Mania treatment. You can report this to Domino's as well as the store manager, click photo and name and shame on x.com and Google Maps reviews. Not only will they lose reputation but you will get your money back 100%. I've personally complained a few times and everytime I did I got a callback from Dominos and they would always credit 300 rs in my Dominos account wallet. Bada kamzor leg piece hai‚Ä¶ Iss chicken ko polio ho gaya tha kya? File a complaint You've pretty much repeated the same thing I've said. You can simply order a pizza if you have cravings for it while making pizza at home from scratch, not only requires time, preparations, and quality ingredients but also a skill like baking it at the right temperation and getting it done just right. You also need to love cooking something that I personally don't really like doing. I've seen my friends either under bake or overburn their home made pizzas. It's all good if you have the patience to learn but just not worth it for most people. This is why I only order Margherita from Domino's, toppings are a scam there. It has been quite some time since I have ordered from dominos but the next time I do I will keep an eye on it and make sure to raise complaint Thanks! Yes. Wow!! Take a load of this guy xD Sue them! Wtf... really? Those toppings look too heavy for the slice to hold them. Late 90s were awesome. I recommend you oven story pizza it's my favourite oh fuck, I love your humour lol. I am gonna steal this comment btw hehe ‚ÄúIndians ko kya hi samjhega cheese me fark‚Äù - dominos Damnn I had the opposite experience! üò≤üòã bon appetite! Exactly Wapas karde bhai mat kha. Isme yahan post karne jaisa kya tha? A thousand for THAT? no way. Mere ghar ke paas ek small business pizza shop hai wo log 350 mai itna bada/isse bada pizza dete hai and at least 3 times this much toppings. Burgers online are an even bigger scam lmfao looks like a fkin good pizza (in standards of what we get in india) You spent a thousand on a pizza ? Still better than what I got i guess ü§° omg üò≠ And this was a medium pizza ü•≤ üòî r/mildlyinfuriating Resembles arranged marriages what you see vs what you getü§£ Ordered this mainly due to a 60% discount. It was packed with cheese and tomato puree, but disappointingly sparse on toppings. NOTE: Next time go there and have your PIZZZA Dont Order haha Dominos has been increasing the prices and decreasing the toppings proportionally üòÉ The images shown are just for representation purpose. Oven Story is the best in India"
