You can hear her reprimanding a fellow student for not hitting his classmate hard enough. She also says she does this regularly without any remorse. Imagine a new generation of young people brought up with hate instilled in them at such a tender age. \n\nHere is a [link](https://twitter.com/alishan_jafri/status/1695063195503726819)\n\nThe future is bleak .\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Not sure what to say at this point , was hopeful to an extent but having watched this video that lady smirking asking  another kid to hit him properly the guy laughing nd recording the video .Just feel so sorry for that kid 😞  . Can only hope things change ..",

        "Yes, in detention camps and jails as per current norms.",
        "Apparently the police will not take any action because the teacher has apologised and the father of the child has given in writing that he doesn’t wish to make a complaint 🤐",
        "There's no future unless they fight back, which they wouldn't. The Sanghis have now realised that, and figured out that they can do whatever the fuck they want to do without any retribution.",
        "As long as BJP in power, no!",
        "Nope. Unfortunately that's what majority of the people who vote want. So they will keep on voting for a Govt to power who will provide them that. For all economic/technological progress India makes , social progress in India will always remain a challenge.",
        "Why would they fight back? Sanghis will use that against them to play victim. It's upto the non-radicalised Hindu majority to fight for their rights as citizens.",
        "Coming soon to your neighborhood schools. I remember a scene from Schindler's list where all the Jews were being driven out of their homes, their properties being confiscated. All the white neighbors were chanting \"Goodbye Jews! Hope you never return\" while they are being taken to concentration camps.\n\nI don't want to speculate anything but I hope we don't end up at this stage.",
        "At This rate this country will fall into civil war",
        "The only thing non-radicalised Hindus can do is vote out the government, which they're doing. But if the radicalisation has gone way too deep and that doesn't work, it's either fight or flight for the Muslims.",
        "You have to be a real low life to take it out on kids. Find someone your own size you piece of filth.",
        "They will make Muslim second class citizens by stripping away their rights piece by piece + spread hate towards them. Eventually there will be pogroms in some places. \n\nWe can see it happening slowly. They won't go full throttle due to size of their population. \n\nIf Muslims try to push back by means of protest or even some level of violence, they will be labeled terrorists due to their faith. \n\nOfcourse no one will talk about their deteriorating social economic status by that time. It will all be religion focused.",
        "muslim here, how is it like to be an ex?",
        "Let me tell you a little story. Take rallies. Hurl abuses, go through Muslim neighborhoods, provoke. When Muslims retaliate, paint them as the demons all over the 9Pm news channels.",
        "Its only a matter of time",
        "Would like to see non radicalized Hindus take some control but I see them as being the silent community who will just accept it out of fear of being abused/ridiculed by the radicals. \n\nHappens quite often in places where nationalism or religious fundamentalism spews out of control.",

        "How is you being an Ex-Muslim relevant here? As long as you have a Muslim name you’re game for Chaddis.",
        "Civil war needs opposing forces of the same magnitude. If one is much stronger, the end result is pogrom. \n\nWait. We are already there!",

        "Ramdaan months are hard.",
        "Here's a question, would Muslims being quiet and taking all this shit from the Sanghis suddenly change their heart and make them not want to kill or attack Muslims? No. Same thing happened in Nazi Germany where they picked up Jews who were living in ghettos and basements and they got executed in concentration camps. There's 0% chance of this working. \n\nIf you fight back, on the other hand, sure, the genocide can still happen, but there's a nonzero probability that as Sanghis begin to lose people, they figure out that whatever Hindu Rashtra they want to create can come at the cost of their own lives.\n\nI'm not telling all of them should fight. There's the other option of flight too. But sitting there, taking all the pain and maybe even getting killed, without any retaliation, is the stupidest decision in this situation.",
        "It isnt any better for hindus in muslim dominated regions. Every coin has 2 faces.",
        "I really wish the teacher and the police who didn't take action against the teacher get hit by horrible karma within the next few days.",
        "No wonder we have come to this. Imagine unreported incidents.",
        "I absolutely loathed Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi but I detest our current government even more. Minorities have never been under more threat in their daily lives than under this govt. Call me sensitive or whatever but everytime I see something like this, I feel this dread that can't quite be put into words. There is a systematic oppression and cleansing of minorities (religion and castes) within the country rn. This govt needs to go. Something tells me someone like Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam would never have had the chance to be president under BJP government.",

        ">cost of their own lives.\n\nThis can be easily spun over as Martyrdom among the radicalized groups to create potential new recruits for violence\n\nViolence by a minority with zero institutional power results in their Genocide. \n\nThe only way for them to resist is by organizing collectively on the basis of shared of economic interest with the non-radicalized majority",
        "Can you please provide a source which can confirm it's not a fake news. The link you shared is a tweet, and that's not enough. Also how do you reach the conclusion that the kid gets the beating because he is Muslim and not because he was doing some mischief in the class?",

        "I’m speechless!",
        "Fuck off to your shithole subreddit you Chaddi scum.",
        "I feel there is no hope. I’m an ex-Hindu with an explicit Hindu name. I am from South India - which is supposedly better than other parts of the country and yet I am shit scared of the future. I see people around me slowly getting radicalized by the propaganda factory. I am losing hope day by day. God knows what the upcoming election season is going to bring. \n\nIf this is what my country, my India has turned into I don’t want to live here. I am just going to do everything in my power to emigrate.",

I don't know how many people know this, but the way Hitler industrialized genocide wasn't feasible *either*. But he did it anyway because hate is stronger than reason.",
        "Being an ex is mostly the same. Except maybe haters think it is okay to shit on muslims infront of me, thinking I will agree, because I dont practice Islam.",
        "I just feel sad thinking how that kid would've walked back home that day, with disappointment in his face, despair and betrayal in his eyes.\n\n I don't know how he would've even fallen asleep, even if he did, I know for sure, the next nothing wouldn't have been the same, no nothing would be the same for this kid for years to come. \n\nI feel really sad for him.",
        "That twitter account is of a journalist. Not some random account.",
        "Not true. Tamilians weren't even remotely as strong as Singhalese but still managed to fuck them up for several decades. \n\nIt just takes a tipping point. Once people realise that their life isn't any better than death they'll give their life to fighting.",

        "True. \n\nYour average Ex-Muslim comes from extremely privileged background. They tend to be ill informed about the political reality of Muslims in India.  \n\nThey assume that their hatred for Muslims/Islam will make Chaddis go soft.",
        "just another monkey with literacy but no education or intelligence or empathy trapped in a human body doing tribalism.",
        "Well ...250 mil plus is a decent size. Imagine pushing that amount of people around. \n\nPlus to add on top, Hitler had ripped German constitution apart and gave himself supreme command. That's how Germany became fascist. We are seeing the stripping of democracy and human rights in India rn slowly...it could lead to that level later maybe. \n\nOfcourse the hate was stronger than rational reasoning. Perhaps it can get nasty in the upcoming years.",
        "Yup , Muslims are undoubtedly targeted every time .\n\n[https://siliguritimes.com/schoolgirl-brutal-murder-case-police-arrests-accused-in-siliguri/](https://siliguritimes.com/schoolgirl-brutal-murder-case-police-arrests-accused-in-siliguri/)",

        "The future is bleak indeed",
        "so are they like rude to you?",
        "People who do these things are insecure disrespectful and disgusting assholes. I bet there is a special place in hell for douchebags like these. Very heartbreaking to say the least for the kid and I hope they rot in jail forever.",
        "This is something all of us much understand; violence is violence-it sees no difference among people... Today the target may be muslims, tomorrow it will be baseless. \n\nAnd our morals seem to dropping rapidly...at the school i studied in, all the classmates would have beaten up the teacher for hurting one of our own..we didn't see religion, a friend was a friend. A brother was a brother.",
        "They mostly don't say anything anymore because they know I will stand up for myself.\n\nHowever there are lot of young exmuslims who are not financially independent who have to put up with things like threats, insults, emotional blackmail for not following the religion.\n\nIt mostly depends on how religious your family is to begin with.",
        "Your assumption is false.",
        "Punish every single teacher,elder or religious leaders who spew hatred against other religions.\nKeep complaining about Muslims or hindus we'll never see peace.\nIt has to be the same for everyone across all religions.\nOrelse there'll be a hundred videos of Muslims committing crime against Hindus popping up everytime a Muslim wants justice.",
        "Janis will be lower down . The community has real influence in business and plus the more right wing thinking ones smartly let the sangh do their dirty work.",
        "Painting demons is one thing. Demolishing their home. And making entire families homeless.\n\nOver 1200 homes and shops were demolished mostly belonging to Muslims, the judge who took sou motu cognizance was transferred, the gurgaon police officer who arrested sudarshan news journalist was transferred\n\nThe sp from haryana who sent notice to people calling for boycott of Muslims was transferred.\n\n  \n\n\nThe writing is on the wall... Bjp government will do anything in its power to oppress Muslim.",
        "Bitch i lived in a majority muslim area, in a rented house owned by muslims in bangalore.Nothing remotely dangerous happened to me. I used to go to college, come back, study and go to sleep.\n\nNo one gave a fuck. Even used to burst crackers on diwali and the local muslim kids used to come and ask for crackers from me. No one cared.\n\nYou live in a delusional world where you are the oppressed even though you are the oppressor.",
        "My experiences have been different.\n\nThe exmuslims I know do not believe for a moment that chaddis will treat them any better.\n\nThe most vocal exmuslims tend to be from privileged backgrounds but as such the privileged exmuslims are not particularly concerned about the situation because they are rich. \n\nThere is a significant number of Indian Exmuslims on YouTube who ally themselves with chaddis.",

        "No future honestly. Those who stay back, do so at grave risk to life and property. I never felt like leaving and still don't but I fear for what my child will have to go through (if I have one).

It figured out a formula to work with the basal emotions of the average Indian.\n\nHowever, it can't hope to remain in power if it doesn't maximize its vote bases. It's just simply politics and a numbers game. The change in strategy is very little. It also lost a lot of state elections. So the trend is towards bjps decline in power, not in consolidation of power.\n\nSo we don't have to worry in extreme terms. Especially don't add flames to the fire of communal hate. You see communal hate exists in the population. The leaders just make use of it.\n\nRegarding second point. I don't know enough to comment. But I'm open to learning.",

So if the BJP tries to woo Muslims, the core is going to hate it. \n\nPasmanda and Ashraf doesn't matter. Most of the BJPs core doesn't know what those mean and they don't care. For them a Muslim is a jihadi, plain and simple. And they have been fed a steady diet of anti Muslim bigotry every day and night by BJP aligned media anchors. We have reached a point now that hatred is on autopilot. It doesn't need the BJP to sustain it, and therefore BJPs best strategy is to go with the flow and take advantage of the hate.\n\nThey realised this fact even in 2019, which is why they gave a ticket to a women whose only claim to fame is that she has terror charges against her, and then put her in the Parliamentary Committee on Defence. They also realised this last year when they let a bunch of \"Sanskari Brahmin\" rapists go, and the state of Gujarat rewarded them with the greatest majority in the history of that state. They realised it in UP, where Ajay Bisht, the BJPs next leader explicitly stated that Hindus and Muslims can't coexist period. \n\nThis idea that the BJP will get more inclusive and mellow is naive at best. Every leader of the BJP has gotten more and more hardcore. Vajpayee was more moderate than Advani, who was more moderate than Modi. The trend will continue with Ajay Bisht being the next.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Is there a future for Muslims in this country?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Just watched a video where a teacher is asking her students to hit a lone Muslim student. No, this is not a whatsapp forward. the student looks maybe around 10 years old. You can hear her reprimanding a fellow student for not hitting his classmate hard enough. She also says she does this regularly without any remorse. Imagine a new generation of young people brought up with hate instilled in them at such a tender age. Here is a [link](https://twitter.com/alishan_jafri/status/1695063195503726819) The future is bleak . &#x200B;",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Either way, I am stuck here. Hoping that someone here shares a perspective that gives me hope. Not sure what to say at this point , was hopeful to an extent but having watched this video that lady smirking asking another kid to hit him properly the guy laughing nd recording the video .Just feel so sorry for that kid 😞 . Can only hope things change .. Muzaffarnagar: This video is from Neha Public School of Khubbapur, Muzaffarnagar, UP - Teacher name: Tripta Tyagi - The teacher is getting one student bêātên one by one by the rest of the students while passing IsIamophobic comments ''maine to declare kar diya, jitne bhi mohemdan bachche hain, unke waha chale jaao.... male voice: sahi kaha ji, padhai kharab ho'' Yes, in detention camps and jails as per current norms. Apparently the police will not take any action because the teacher has apologised and the father of the child has given in writing that he doesn’t wish to make a complaint 🤐 There's no future unless they fight back, which they wouldn't. The Sanghis have now realised that, and figured out that they can do whatever the fuck they want to do without any retribution. As long as BJP in power, no! Nope. Unfortunately that's what majority of the people who vote want. So they will keep on voting for a Govt to power who will provide them that. For all economic/technological progress India makes , social progress in India will always remain a challenge. Why would they fight back? Sanghis will use that against them to play victim. It's upto the non-radicalised Hindu majority to fight for their rights as citizens. Coming soon to your neighborhood schools. I remember a scene from Schindler's list where all the Jews were being driven out of their homes, their properties being confiscated. All the white neighbors were chanting \"Goodbye Jews! Hope you never return\" while they are being taken to concentration camps. I don't want to speculate anything but I hope we don't end up at this stage. At This rate this country will fall into civil war The only thing non-radicalised Hindus can do is vote out the government, which they're doing. But if the radicalisation has gone way too deep and that doesn't work, it's either fight or flight for the Muslims. You have to be a real low life to take it out on kids. Find someone your own size you piece of filth. They will make Muslim second class citizens by stripping away their rights piece by piece + spread hate towards them. Eventually there will be pogroms in some places. We can see it happening slowly. They won't go full throttle due to size of their population. If Muslims try to push back by means of protest or even some level of violence, they will be labeled terrorists due to their faith. Ofcourse no one will talk about their deteriorating social economic status by that time. It will all be religion focused. muslim here, how is it like to be an ex? Let me tell you a little story. Take rallies. Hurl abuses, go through Muslim neighborhoods, provoke. When Muslims retaliate, paint them as the demons all over the 9Pm news channels. Its only a matter of time Would like to see non radicalized Hindus take some control but I see them as being the silent community who will just accept it out of fear of being abused/ridiculed by the radicals. Happens quite often in places where nationalism or religious fundamentalism spews out of control. We're more than halfway there already. That kid is probably scarred for life. Will have trust issues with each and every hindu he sees in his life. We all know how it works. Exactly right. They'll use any excuse to vilify Muslims. I have lost count of the number of Jihads being propagated. Self-Defense Jihad will be the new one The slient too are complicit. You have got to be blind and deaf if you don't understand what's happening around us. and to top it, police join these radicals. There was a video in nuh and caa riots where police was standing next to these radicals shooting or throwing stones. Hell, the shooters are joining the political parties too. How is you being an Ex-Muslim relevant here? As long as you have a Muslim name you’re game for Chaddis. Civil war needs opposing forces of the same magnitude. If one is much stronger, the end result is pogrom. Wait. We are already there! Crosspost to india speaks and watch the reaction 1. Muslims 2. Christians 3. Jain / Buddhist 4. Sikh 5. Lower cast 6. Middle cast 7. Upper middle cast ..... so on and so forth. (Seen this before in the 1930-40 elsewhere) Hence the brackets…. Same, I am an ex too. But we need to stand against what's wrong. This is pure evil. Is she human? Is there a god in any religion who will be happy by this. Ramdaan months are hard. Here's a question, would Muslims being quiet and taking all this shit from the Sanghis suddenly change their heart and make them not want to kill or attack Muslims? No. Same thing happened in Nazi Germany where they picked up Jews who were living in ghettos and basements and they got executed in concentration camps. There's 0% chance of this working. If you fight back, on the other hand, sure, the genocide can still happen, but there's a nonzero probability that as Sanghis begin to lose people, they figure out that whatever Hindu Rashtra they want to create can come at the cost of their own lives. I'm not telling all of them should fight. There's the other option of flight too. But sitting there, taking all the pain and maybe even getting killed, without any retaliation, is the stupidest decision in this situation. It isnt any better for hindus in muslim dominated regions. Every coin has 2 faces. I really wish the teacher and the police who didn't take action against the teacher get hit by horrible karma within the next few days. No wonder we have come to this. Imagine unreported incidents. I absolutely loathed Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi but I detest our current government even more. Minorities have never been under more threat in their daily lives than under this govt. Call me sensitive or whatever but everytime I see something like this, I feel this dread that can't quite be put into words. There is a systematic oppression and cleansing of minorities (religion and castes) within the country rn. This govt needs to go. Something tells me someone like Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam would never have had the chance to be president under BJP government. Yes, the extremists will go easy on you while lynching considering you are not a muslim anymore. What are the Muslim dominated regions? Kashmir? several parts of UP , Kashmir obviously , even several places in NCR 😂 A teacher made me massage her back in 2nd standard, she was never able to become a teacher or stay in the same district again. If it were my young parents they would've fucked this teacher up. What about suo motu? I'm not sure which law it'll fall under, but this is obviously the work of a criminally insane teacher. >cost of their own lives. This can be easily spun over as Martyrdom among the radicalized groups to create potential new recruits for violence Violence by a minority with zero institutional power results in their Genocide. The only way for them to resist is by organizing collectively on the basis of shared of economic interest with the non-radicalized majority Can you please provide a source which can confirm it's not a fake news. The link you shared is a tweet, and that's not enough. Also how do you reach the conclusion that the kid gets the beating because he is Muslim and not because he was doing some mischief in the class? Until there is RSS or BJP or Idiots who believe in their ideologies forget About it. I’m speechless! Fuck off to your shithole subreddit you Chaddi scum. I feel there is no hope. I’m an ex-Hindu with an explicit Hindu name. I am from South India - which is supposedly better than other parts of the country and yet I am shit scared of the future. I see people around me slowly getting radicalized by the propaganda factory. I am losing hope day by day. God knows what the upcoming election season is going to bring. If this is what my country, my India has turned into I don’t want to live here. I am just going to do everything in my power to emigrate. Bro thinks he'll be spared. Shias are in the same delusion. Might offer a coke in between beating to death. >There's no future unless they fight back, which they wouldn't. Instruction unclear. I did fight back and now my house is bulldozed. What to do? More like a cold beer or something... Hate is installed in people DNA now. People don't even think what will be the byproduct of these much hate. >They won't go full throttle due to size of their population. I'd just like to add here that fascists aren't rational. I don't know how many people know this, but the way Hitler industrialized genocide wasn't feasible *either*. But he did it anyway because hate is stronger than reason. Being an ex is mostly the same. Except maybe haters think it is okay to shit on muslims infront of me, thinking I will agree, because I dont practice Islam. I just feel sad thinking how that kid would've walked back home that day, with disappointment in his face, despair and betrayal in his eyes. I don't know how he would've even fallen asleep, even if he did, I know for sure, the next nothing wouldn't have been the same, no nothing would be the same for this kid for years to come. I feel really sad for him. That twitter account is of a journalist. Not some random account. Not true. Tamilians weren't even remotely as strong as Singhalese but still managed to fuck them up for several decades. It just takes a tipping point. Once people realise that their life isn't any better than death they'll give their life to fighting. Why can't you simply post the video link? Bro what the fuck. Throw her in jail for POSCO. What the fuck? What the fuck? That mf bitch. Fuck her she should be jailed and tortured. First this will happen to Muslims then they will come for your caste, then they will come after girls wearing western cloths and so onnn. The things that will happen in future are going to shock the whole world. True. Your average Ex-Muslim comes from extremely privileged background. They tend to be ill informed about the political reality of Muslims in India. They assume that their hatred for Muslims/Islam will make Chaddis go soft. just another monkey with literacy but no education or intelligence or empathy trapped in a human body doing tribalism. Well ...250 mil plus is a decent size. Imagine pushing that amount of people around. Plus to add on top, Hitler had ripped German constitution apart and gave himself supreme command. That's how Germany became fascist. We are seeing the stripping of democracy and human rights in India rn slowly...it could lead to that level later maybe. Ofcourse the hate was stronger than rational reasoning. Perhaps it can get nasty in the upcoming years. Yup , Muslims are undoubtedly targeted every time . [https://siliguritimes.com/schoolgirl-brutal-murder-case-police-arrests-accused-in-siliguri/](https://siliguritimes.com/schoolgirl-brutal-murder-case-police-arrests-accused-in-siliguri/) Not many Muslims talk to ex Muslims so casually. Quiet a surprise for me Not much different unless your family and friends give you grief for not praying, attending Friday prayers or fasting during Ramadan. Finding a significant other is infinitely more difficult if you are into that sort of thing. And then some goons will have the audacity to call him \"madarsachhap\" and ridicule their entire community for sending their kids to religious schools instead of public ones. why should I be rude, even I am not a proper Muslim, I just pray 3/5 times a day The future is bleak indeed so are they like rude to you? People who do these things are insecure disrespectful and disgusting assholes. I bet there is a special place in hell for douchebags like these. Very heartbreaking to say the least for the kid and I hope they rot in jail forever. This is something all of us much understand; violence is violence-it sees no difference among people... Today the target may be muslims, tomorrow it will be baseless. And our morals seem to dropping rapidly...at the school i studied in, all the classmates would have beaten up the teacher for hurting one of our own..we didn't see religion, a friend was a friend. A brother was a brother. They mostly don't say anything anymore because they know I will stand up for myself. However there are lot of young exmuslims who are not financially independent who have to put up with things like threats, insults, emotional blackmail for not following the religion. It mostly depends on how religious your family is to begin with. Your assumption is false. Punish every single teacher,elder or religious leaders who spew hatred against other religions. Keep complaining about Muslims or hindus we'll never see peace. It has to be the same for everyone across all religions. Orelse there'll be a hundred videos of Muslims committing crime against Hindus popping up everytime a Muslim wants justice. Janis will be lower down . The community has real influence in business and plus the more right wing thinking ones smartly let the sangh do their dirty work. Painting demons is one thing. Demolishing their home. And making entire families homeless. Over 1200 homes and shops were demolished mostly belonging to Muslims, the judge who took sou motu cognizance was transferred, the gurgaon police officer who arrested sudarshan news journalist was transferred The sp from haryana who sent notice to people calling for boycott of Muslims was transferred. The writing is on the wall... Bjp government will do anything in its power to oppress Muslim. Bitch i lived in a majority muslim area, in a rented house owned by muslims in bangalore.Nothing remotely dangerous happened to me. I used to go to college, come back, study and go to sleep. No one gave a fuck. Even used to burst crackers on diwali and the local muslim kids used to come and ask for crackers from me. No one cared. You live in a delusional world where you are the oppressed even though you are the oppressor. My experiences have been different. The exmuslims I know do not believe for a moment that chaddis will treat them any better. The most vocal exmuslims tend to be from privileged backgrounds but as such the privileged exmuslims are not particularly concerned about the situation because they are rich. There is a significant number of Indian Exmuslims on YouTube who ally themselves with chaddis. I prefer Mountain Dew. Yes. They will surely stop to have a discussion about my lack of faith before they go easy on me. Always have and I hope I will have the courage to always do so. Shri Ram? *Naam to suna ho ga?* I was just stating an observation Yes. I said I was exmuslim as I didn't want to misrepresent myself. This woman should be thrown in jail. What kind of behaviour is she promoting? And why aren't the rest of the school staff, the police or media taking any action against them? So? Does one wrong makes another one right? No child has to go through this bullshit regardless of their religion. Take your whataboutry and shove it up your ass mf. Such people who spread hatred will be finally consumed by hatred, it is diabolical. Poor kid will be traumatic for life. This is nothing but nurturing communal clashes right from childhood in an attempt to normalize it. curious.. why would you \"absolutely loathe\" them?? What’s even more sad is she will get away easily without any consequences, and phir bhi aadhi besharam junta bolegi hindoo khatre mein hain. Bhagwaan sab kuch banaye bas gareeb aur india me minority na banaye. No future honestly. Those who stay back, do so at grave risk to life and property. I never felt like leaving and still don't but I fear for what my child will have to go through (if I have one). The future is bleak because you see there is entire generation of children which is being poisoned with evil by their own teachers. The outrage will last a day or two and then it's back to the terrifying new normal of New India. Does anyone remember when a Muslim kid was beaten for drinking water from a temple? This kind of hatred is not new. Wtf It’s so ironic that if god exists, all these hardcore hindutva hateful idiots will be judged the most by God. Their devotion isn’t devotion, it’s just primal hate. They’re psychopaths, they’d do the same things islamic jihadists did in 2000s if they could. No. This is why next year’s election is important. Lmao. 🤡 It is the work of a criminal and insane system that includes the government, the media, Hindu religious leaders and a lot of other people. Magnitude is not in just physical strength. It is in many things including the strength of internal communication as well as the conviction of the people. Examples (mutually unrelated): Radio Rawanda / Che Guevara. Nah, this shit is traumatising. These kinds of things destroy self confidence and living In such environment for long time pushes the child to take a wrong step. This is fucked up. Hell I’d rather not study at all then see such a teacher’s face everyday and not do anything about it. PR masterclass by the Sangh, its sleeper agents and enablers. You are so right. Anyone remembers what happened to those hate mongers at hardwar? Shame on you The downvoters might be Hindus and Hindutvavadis who took offence at you pointing out that Hindutvavadis have traditionally taken the name of Ram while committing violence? Just speculation on my part. >Ofcourse the hate was stronger than rational reasoning If only you could follow news that usually goes unreported, you're in for a big surprise. What usually happens - nothing. I believe all parties are out on bail. Not a shocker since even baby killers and gang rapists are released from prison in this country.

The futurr looks bleak. Urban fanatics like this u/Radiant_Skull77 are the reason such things happen. With zero ethics in their minds, they have a way of justifying everything using such shitty logic. Though there was only one fanatic slapper physically in that school, those slaps were enjoyed and delivered virtually by millions of such fanatic hands. I think the Islamic God is cool with doing bad things to nom believers Do stupid things win stupid prizes A good number of Jains these days spread more venom than a lot of Sanghis. He was hanged by the government of India and rightly so. He wasn't given a government office instead. Check Update of my post. Many people think the home min is Hindu. They should make her stand in front of her society or in the school and let each and every student and teachers slap her as hard as possible, record her and make it viral. It's only 'tit for tat' for such retards. Though she should be punished according to law as well but we all know how it works. Set her as an example that every action has consequences. so that the kids will also learn a lesson. \"The accused, identified as Mohammad Abbas (22), was arrested within five hours of the incident from Lenin Colony in Siliguri.\" \"The rapists walked out of jail and were fed sweets, garlands were placed on their necks, even as a BJP leader who was involved in the decision to release Bilkis Bano's rapists, amid a huge backlash, had described them as Sanskari Brahmins.\" Please continue with your narrative though. Please stop asking for proofs of things you are not going to believe anyway. Your mind only has one narrative and any news that doesn't serve it is fake news. Why do you need a source then? What difference will it make? You've made up your mind in any case. Chadarmod are here to defend this. Mofos treat their own people from lower caste worst, this is what mofos here reading voted for and they are enjoying it. This is expected behaviour from Cowca cola people This is absolutely shameful and I have always believed that schools should be free from religious things n political motivations thats be it this monster teacher discriminating a small child based on his religion , be it students demanding to wear hijab and saffron shawls, what is most disgusting in this video that she was motivating other kids of same age to commit physical abuse against the poor kid, this hate should not be tolerated, teacher should be behind bars Fuck BJP. To win elections, they have filled the minds of itizens with communal poison. Forget about Muslims, there is no future for even secular Hindus in this country. Is there anyone more stupid than chaddis? I watched a video where a Sanghi terrorist won elections. Both the present and future is bleak. Are all Sanghis illiterates? that's not true. I know people who have turned atheists. I have good relation with them as Muslim. A lot of times because even though they are not practising now, we both grew up in similar households so we relate to a lot of things Fantaics like him are probably engaged in many crimes. Deserve to the thrown in jail. Man, why should that kid have any respect for this country after this? There is an Indian Express article as well. But none of that won't matter to you probably. Fuck off with your both sides argument Exactly, Let's hope he moves to some other more accepting place and finds peace and inclusion eventually. Thankfully, I haven't faced anything remotely to this where I am from. cool It is bleak. Many younger people who are adults today had a chance to grow in a far more pluralistic and forward looking society--despite periodic outbreaks of violence--than the one that children are growing up in now. However, the vast majority of those who enjoy hatred and cruelty for its own sake are petty cowards. Those who fantasize about inflicting misery on others are emboldened in this political climate, where they are openly supported by the leaders, the media, and the institutions. Hence they become small-minded tyrants, like the teacher in the video. If the leaders, and the media, and the institutions change for the better, while it will not eradicate the bigotry within such people's hearts, they will once more have to suppress it because they will grasp quickly that it will no longer be tolerated or celebrated. Time will tell if such a change is possible. Those who can do something about it appear to be trying, and many who are suffering economically are slowly realizing that the direction of the country is against their better interests. But it might already be too late. All I do is pray that I don't end up losing all hopes for this country, it physically hurts to see such things now and then Cool Why did the teacher ask one student to hit the other? I don’t understand? One article says that it was because the student being hit had not memorized math tables. Others are implying that this is communal… What’s going on? Channelling in my inner George Carlin, I must say that religion is probably the worst thing that ever happened to humanity and incidents such as this prove it time and again. While a teacher asking students to vote for educate political leaders was immediately fired this lady will continue to be employed and may even be given a promotion by Yogi state. Sad! I remember my Hindi teacher doing this with a dalit student in primary school. 90s. And possibly fall to the wrong crowd all because of this shit bag teacher and that kid . the teacher doesn't sound too smart - can't even articulate her bigotry in her mother tongue well. btw did she pick out hindu students in particular to trash a muslim boy ? I mean they’re all alright with it. They can suck it lmao A few comments 1. Please don't share such videos. It just increases the flames, also it can be used by Muslim haters to enjoy the show. 2. With around 14 percent of Indians being Muslim, I don't think their future is at stake. 3. The current govt recognizes it. Also you can notice the change in narrative in Modis second term. ( even if it is only in terms of strategy) 4. I believe the govt should do more to address the sentiment that it is against Muslims. It just uses that to get the vote of Muslim haters. 5. Religion based politics is played by all sides. Whether they reach out Muslims and be \"appeasing\" so to speak. Or not like the current govt. As long as the population can be distracted, we will be distracted. Instead, we need to focus on other issues more. Ask harder questions and slowly the eyeballs on Religion issues will reduce and politicians will stop selling votes based on religion. She is from UP, so already the bar was very low. Aka chaddis The genocide radar is already ringing alarm bells. I would argue that lower castes are already second place, on the target list. Your kid should feel like this kid once. Guys like you unfortunately deserve it. Something tells me that she will have a hard time trying to solve problems like 2+2 or 19×19 Could you explain please Im just cuiroius nd dont know anything about this The current govt recognizes what exactly? And change do you see in the narrative in this term? As for asking harder questions, anyone who dares to do so gets slapped with tax raids. Even loyal boys like Sudhir get publicly reminded of their place when they step a bit out of line. Did any of the kids stand up to this monster? Really wonder if the common Hindu in today's India feels a sense of entitlement or privilege, nodding and smirking at such incidents, whilst thanking providence, that fortunately he's on the right side of the coin this time and as such, his own personal future seems great in this country ? Home minister is a Hindu Vaishnav baniya(according to google) not jain . All the people with surname shah are not jains. Shah surname is used by many baniya hindus of Gujarat also apart from jains. Ps i am not a sanghi .I don't support bjp and hindutvwadis. That they need Muslim votes. - sab ka sath, sab ka Vikas, Modi reaching out to Pasmanda Muslims. So definitely bjps core vote base is the Hindu votes in northern states. It figured out a formula to work with the basal emotions of the average Indian. However, it can't hope to remain in power if it doesn't maximize its vote bases. It's just simply politics and a numbers game. The change in strategy is very little. It also lost a lot of state elections. So the trend is towards bjps decline in power, not in consolidation of power. So we don't have to worry in extreme terms. Especially don't add flames to the fire of communal hate. You see communal hate exists in the population. The leaders just make use of it. Regarding second point. I don't know enough to comment. But I'm open to learning. The problem is that its core base does not want accommodation with the Muslims, quite the opposite in fact. So if the BJP tries to woo Muslims, the core is going to hate it. Pasmanda and Ashraf doesn't matter. Most of the BJPs core doesn't know what those mean and they don't care. For them a Muslim is a jihadi, plain and simple. And they have been fed a steady diet of anti Muslim bigotry every day and night by BJP aligned media anchors. We have reached a point now that hatred is on autopilot. It doesn't need the BJP to sustain it, and therefore BJPs best strategy is to go with the flow and take advantage of the hate. They realised this fact even in 2019, which is why they gave a ticket to a women whose only claim to fame is that she has terror charges against her, and then put her in the Parliamentary Committee on Defence. They also realised this last year when they let a bunch of \"Sanskari Brahmin\" rapists go, and the state of Gujarat rewarded them with the greatest majority in the history of that state. They realised it in UP, where Ajay Bisht, the BJPs next leader explicitly stated that Hindus and Muslims can't coexist period. This idea that the BJP will get more inclusive and mellow is naive at best. Every leader of the BJP has gotten more and more hardcore. Vajpayee was more moderate than Advani, who was more moderate than Modi. The trend will continue with Ajay Bisht being the next. Until there are Hindus in Bharat, Muslims have a bright future .. why are you generalizing behavior of one demented person ? is not that something every Muslim say when any Islamic terrorist attack happens? Not all muslims are bad and terrorists dont represent Islam? We have to rise above all these and stand against these degenerates who harass others based on religion and weed out these criminals. r/indianmuslims Death penalty. fr, and if we speak up against this, we're shamed for not supporting our own religion; it's so stupid, smh dude the fact that most scriptures say that he was someone who wouldn't even hurt a fly unless his duties called, and these senseless fools promoting violence on his name is the most horrendous shit ever True it’s like putting everyone in a dilemma also another word used for Hindus not supporting BJP is anti nationalist Seems bleak... Especially under the current dispensation whose regressive and violent ideologies have infiltrated into all nooks on crannies of the society. I don't see things getting better which is scary and utterly depressing The fact check has came, 1st: she is unable to stand, so she makes kids slap each other 2nd: the kid in the video hadn't completed his hw of learning the tables 3rd: what she said \" Mohammadan ki main mayke chali jati hain toh padhai kharab hoti hain Ps. Before jumping the gun like libbi and mussu who want every opportunity to show how oppressed they are, this teacher and his husband, had taught 5 Muslim kids free of cost, when a married Muslim man eloped with some other woman of the village, leaving his first wife to fend for herself. wse ye h to galat feel bad for the kid You guys..that video broke me..that poor child. Very hopeless about the future of Muslims and other minorities in this country. Do you guys think if Congress comes to power this situation will change? What are your thoughts? I have a feeling they too will milk this situation we are all in right now? Ig Taliban This government has polluted the masses' minds with their religious venom & if you speak against this government's hateful practices you're देशद्रोही instantly. We're going to live in nazi germany soon practically if this system doesn't change. Obligatory \"Fuck BJP\" from someone who's sick of their rhetoric! The hike minister has himself claimed that he is not a Jaij, but a Hindu. No Because Mr Ram is not real. Future of muslims in india is unsure! Not only Muslims but anyone standing up to this regime has no future in this country. Sorry if it is too pessimistic view but that's what I feel If the teacher was Muslim bulldozer would've been sent by now i remember one thing from my childhood,\" jab tak iss Desh main ram ki puja hogi, sita ko humesha vanwas he milega\" stayed with me forever. Btw same dude went chasing a golden deer which I am sure wasn't to feed the deer but to hunt so not sure what the eff they think The misconception that most muslims are aggressive is put together by these sanghis in the first place. All my muslim friends are very civilized and respectful of others beliefs and can accept criticism of quran to some degree I agree with you that it's just a story, but I don't believe that's the majority opinion or the reason. Ramayana, Ayodhya, Ram Setu are all perceived as real ancient history by many. No bro I dont think there's any future.... where do u think we can migrate to for better safety ? Doesn't matter what anyone's opinion is. It's either real or not. The wind blows where the power lies. If BJP stays in power this is what you get. Minorities marginalized everyday. You get a different government in center which doesn't spread hate across communities. So that evil piece of shit is still teaching children, that's just fucking wonderful. So am I. I’m a teacher and I would gladly take death before letting my kids go through this. They’re my babies how could she let it happen to a kid. Villains are made like this Father is afraid of 'you know who' for the safety of his family.. Yeah hindutvawadis keep chanting his name while commiting crimes. But Sri Ram himself was the kind of person who would send messengers to his enemy to avoid war. He attempts to reform Ravana 4 times by sending peace messengers reminding him of his duty as a king. People commiting crimes in his name are hateful to me. Its like they have some license on his name. So this comment does irritate me. Not to hunt but to tame. Sita wanted it because it was beautiful not tasty 😅 when the monster turned out to be a demon he was killed. Really to tame with bow and arrow.wokay got it . Hmm okay Muslims have been living in India for decades He killed it with bow and arrow when he realized it was a demon. Not before. Atleast read what you want to critique bro. If someone did that to my child, I'd fucking drag them on the road and beat the shit out of them irregardless of their gender. It breaks my heart to see this deeply infiltrated hatred against one's religion. I love my country but we'll be our own doom if this doesn't stop. True, that kid will end up hating society and at best will actually move on, most likely he will grow up to be like 2020 joker, and at worst............... Sadly that hag will not face any repercussions and the dad is too poor and scared to press charges Akhir bakre ki amma kab tak khair manayegi. I hope bakre ki amma wakes up before 2024 elections. Atleast get us a decent opposition. UP is the bane of development in India. Everytime we manage to walk a step ahead they pull us back 5 steps with their communal divide. Don't mind idiots on both sides. I am a malayalee hindu who does not agree with this government's definition of hinduism. I too get bonked from both sides. Please read what you wrote first. Taming with bow and arrow and then when he killed then only realised it's a demon. So please you should think before debating 😉. Children tried to not hit hard. She mocked these kids for not having enough strength. When even the kid innately knows its wrong this living breathing turd of a woman feels its okay. HOW??? The future for normal people only seems bleak. No future. Go paxstan Evil woman is poisoning kids minds. Poor kid will have to live with the trauma of being hit and insulted for life now. How do you suppose he'll trust others now? I think the father should have reported her to the authorities. Aa gaye bhadwe defend karne Such figures are mostly a mix of multiple persons from relevant times, mixing and matching qualities to match narratives. So, real, yes. Story, yes. Just like Schrodinger's cat. I don't agree. That will make us as monstrous. But the punishment should be landmark harsh. In the Reich, the best of engineers, doctors, teachers, scientists, all worked with one mind to exterminate. You know what I am meaning, right? Wow. So many down votes. For me this looks unbiased opinion. I'm not a BJP supporter. Things like this will slowly scale up. What happened in Manipur will overtime happen all over the country. If I were a muslim, I'd get the fuck out of this country one way or other. There are no future for minorities in India atleast those who don't hold money and power in India. You can see in the news that they are now targeting Christians, Sikhs. Then it will be other communities. Better to escape from here if possible. We are clearly following Nazi Germany path. Dad knows he'll be vilified by the majority of the nation if he dares make a complaint. Yes No way that is going to happen. This is India and in 2023. It's there is other religions too. Like many muslims and christians can't openly be against any of their religious practices because they will quickly be isolated by their mosque/churh, families and neighbours. We went past this phase decades ago and now becoming backward. The hate machine is starting its tho h on specimens at an early age…doing nothing about it means that the gov is fine with it too… A civil war is on the horizon, given where we are today. Muslims have been putting up with brazen social, political and institutional discrimination, humiliation, suspicion, lynch mobs, genocidal hate, calls for their elimination. It is a testament to their magnanimity, their indomitable spirit and their undying faith in the country's ability to course correct that Muslims haven't retaliated yet. But, every community has a threshold for the humiliation, hate and toxicity that it can tolerate. When even the judiciary fails a community, as it has failed Muslims repeatedly in the last nine years when countless Muslims were lynched with the perpetrators always getting off scot-free, when the Hindutva terrorists who demolished Babri were rewarded with the disputed land instead of facing a commensurate sentence, when the Delhi 2020 genocide took place and the judiciary ended up arresting the Muslim protesters instead of the Hindutva terrorists who orchestrated it, when Bilkis Bano's rapists were released, when the propaganda media has never gotten so much as a slap on its wrists despite preparing the grounds for a Muslim genocide, when Nuremberg-like laws such as the CAA-NRC, which exclusively aim to disenfranchise millions of Muslims, were allowed to be introduced, when open calls for boycotting Muslim businesses and open calls for a Muslim genocide go squarely unpunished or when thousands upon thousands of Muslim homes were demolished by local authorities. 2024 is India's last chance to course correct. India's last chance to save India. Otherwise, Hindutva will be the end of India as we know it. There is no doubt about it. And there will be no one to blame for it other than India's majoritarian Hindus. Nah, this country is complete shit hole. Leaving it is the best option. Singapore recently executed an indian merely for possessing drugs, which may be construed as monstrous. They no longer have a major drug problem btw. > landmark harsh Death row is pretty harsh. any info on how it was recorded tho? It's already happening, just in a different form. When the government thinks that it is about to lose power, it will take more extreme measures, that is, to encourage extremists, this is the last madness (I am Chinese) Hitler is a typical example, the Nazis did not want to exterminate the Jews at the beginning I disagree. The rot is so bad that there is no going back for a couple of generations. Imagine the opposite scenario. What would have happened? Sounds like Arfa and Rana's daily rant Yes and No. Honestly if someone can move out, please do. Find any jobs you can, and emigrate. However it's neither a rational solution and nor feasible one. Fighting constitutionally, legally, uniting is the only way, somewhat like Ambedkar. He did something which was almost impossible, although British had equal hand in that, because most things became possible because British were far less bigoted than average hindu govt. But things can change, also I wish for once these Arabian countries, esp UAE, Saudi would just care about muslims a little, rather than looking the other way, considering the power they've.

Sorry I’m really not in the mood to explain. As a non-Hindu, I just had to watch one of my country’s great scientific milestones in Chandrayaan’s landing spot named as Shivshakti. I’m not religious and in fact am incredibly fascinated by Hindu culture. But I’m not Hindu. I thought I lived in a secular country. Maybe not. So fuck this. I’m done. Nah the internet will rid of Islam shortly How ? Worse keeps happening in Pakistan every day. Muslims kidnaps teenage daughters of Hindus, rape them & force convert them to accept Islam and they are married to an old man and used to produce half dozen kids. Even worse the courts give decisions in favour of muslims."
