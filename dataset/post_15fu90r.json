The way Modi-Shah duo have pushed the country to an abyss is simply terrifying.  I was looking at the distribution of the ruling parties in different state and it looks like BJP is on a pretty shaky ground as compared to 2019. While it's true that state election and central elections are fought on a different level, but I.N.D.I.A. still has a realistic chance if they play their cards well.  This nightmare has to end, we can let them turn our  country into the next Somalia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2opvi6hp7lfb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfc8a12dbc8de6ff09df347c763c339cd8dc62e3",

        "BJP knows 2024 is going to be challenging because of the opposition uniting. That's why the BJP is trying to pull a Godhra at the national level before the election. Opposition has to not play into their hands and focus the voters attention to the real issues. How much either side is successful remains to be seen.",

You see all that photo op where everyone is sitting together but then you see news where Sharad Pawar is sharing stage with Modi. Nitish Kumar is pushing his agenda to become a PM face but Congress won't let that happen. TMC convinced AAP to stand with Congress but AAP says it will only support Congress if they in turn support them for the Ordinance bill. Then, you do not have any big party from the north where the major seat sharing is. Congress and SP has minimal presence in Uttar Pradesh and on top of that Owaisi is not part of the coalition which means muslim votes will get distributed wherever he contests on North.\n\nAnd even if I.N.D.I.A somehow achieves the majority. Nitish Kumar, Mamta won't let Congress put forward their PM face which will result in infighting.\n\nPS: I watch Saurabh Dwivedi's Netanagiri to gain all this knowledge and these are not my personal views.",

        "I.N.D.I.A is a big Noo as of now. I have listed reasons and things they can improve on. \n\nIt doesn't make sense for them politically and RaGa is a joker. He benefits BJP more than he does to his own party. \n\nHere's my concern with I.N.D.I.A\n\n1. The name didn't invoke a sense of nationalism in people, as they had expected. Rather people are expecting them to do better, so to become good enough to be worthy of voting. No one wants I.N.D.I.A. to win the elections. They either want the BJP to win, or they want the BJP to lose. \n\n2. Seat sharing during Lok Sabha elections is going to be a mess. It's not just about who gets how many. It's also about who gets which ones? \n\n3. It makes it easy for the BJP to target them. Earlier they had to fight with every party, now it's all in one alliance so they just need to imply that the entire alliance is not good enough. On a local level, a BJP candidate who had to fight with multiple opponents will now fight with one. The country is desperately looking for options. I.N.D.I.A reduced them further. \n\n4. Coming to RaGa because apparently he is the PM candidate. Remember in 2019 he became a shiv bhakt before elections? yeah he is that stupid and people are not. If he does something like that again, The alliance is gone. \n\nHere are a few things I.N.D.I.A should promise to raise support (my opinion)\n\n1. Strict New Law to make it difficult for the ruling party to go MLA shopping. Also, Explain what that law would be. \n\n2. Expose the weakness of this government, The National Security. And no, I don't mean china. I mean these violent riots. How did Seema enter. Raise the issue of drugs in Sikkim, Jammu and Punjab. Paint it a national issue, not a regional one. \n\n3. A strict new law to make sure the ruling party cannot control the media the way it does today. \n\n4. A clear economic policy. No freebies please. They need to understand that people are loving infrastructure building and Congress needs to promise that. \n\n5. A very difficult demand and hence optional, but can turn the tides. Promise to make top ranking officers the ministers. Make it clear that there would be no internal struggle for ministry offices because we won't take any. We would offer it based on the qualification of people. The question is, Can they do this one?",
        "India deserves better than Modi or Rahul.",
        "Atal and manmohan years were coalition governments. Economy in those times was far better than today",
        "They won't win. But will they play all their dirty tricks to hold on to power, is a totally different question.",
        "Cast your Vote right people!  \n\n\nAll the people posting about leaving the country must understand they need to make themselves count if they wish their family & friends to live in a safe, peaceful & progressive country.   \n\n\nUsually People who are swayed by religion politics are left behind and are also the ones who make their votes count.",
        "you are comparing that coalition with the current one. phew!",
        "Yes, it most certainly is on us. I won't wait for an XYZ opposition group to educate me on what's going on inside my own country. It's my responsibility to aid my country in eliminating the threat to democracy it's currently facing.",
        "If they care at all about â€˜INDIAâ€™, theyâ€™ll need to realize they are fighting for something bigger than themselves!",
        "You overestimate the loyalty of these opposition parties.\n\nGenuine question, what unites them? Other than their hatred of the BJP? There isnâ€™t a single unifying ideology or plan that brings them together. The only reason they are together is they donâ€™t like the BJP and want power for themselves.\n\nOne phone call from Amit Shah post election and many of the small parties will jump ship if the offer is good.\n\nItâ€™s a matter of price, they are just trying to increase their price for that eventual phone call from Shah.\n\nYou cannot rely on these hotchpotch clown car of opportunists, dynasts and crooks who will jump ship at one offer from Amit Shah. \n\nCongress needs to become stronger, these regional parties are not reliable",

        "this is a easy wager, BJP is for sure coming back in 2024, the worst thing entire opposition did was to unite under 1 umbrella, it feels more like a desperate bid to keep Modi at bay rather then focusing of development and empowerment.  \n\n\nMoreover the likes of who & who under this I.N.D.I.A, have already been rejected multiple times in previous polls by masses, not sure has changed time time for them.",
        "Until some of them are paid handsomely to switch sides or make breakaway parties post election. Or have the Governor/President choose bhajpa for 6hours at early morning without any notification just to get shitty ordinances passed. The shenanigans bhajpa had been doing in MH since 2014 has been a rollercoaster and are hints as to what they can do. Just yesterday, a study found Bhajpa had disproportionately high wins in recounting everywhere. They won't stop at anything.",
        "Rahul Gandhi has no vision to present to the country his only platform is that he is not modi , he is trying to pull a Joe Biden but Indias electoral realities are different and an anti-modi campaign will not work. He has to present something positive but the best the congress has to offer until now has been outcompeting BJP on freebies and now Karnataka doesn't have Infrastructure budget for a year . The I.N.D.I.A alliance acronym did take the BJP by surprise but the most important thing for the alliance is not to decide a leader nor come up with a common minimum mission but the seat share , lets see how power hungry politicians decide to share their seats , if they work this out without any last minute squabbling they may stand a chance but their chances of getting a majority are near zero",
        "Unless Congress stops backstabbing other parties, people will keep having low faith in coalitions and will vote for a \"directioned\" party instead, no matter how bad is the direction. That was the talk pre-2014 post 26/11 after people demanded war.",
        "24hour news cycle shows voters forget demonetisation woes, fake surgical strikes, covid bodies by the Ganges by the time they have to answer a single 5yearly multiple choice question. The only real way people can press their will on the government is by protesting on the streets the moment such incidents happen. It is a real shame people can congregate and protest for wrong reasons, like gujjars can protest for reservations, people can protest to free rapists but the sane ones won't congregate to protest.\n\nOtherwise voting in democracy is just to see which party has slightly more legitimacy to prevent riots. That is after all the philosophy of voting for the lesser evil, as seen in US, UK where anti-people laws get passed during rw governments but rarely repealed when the left forms government. In captalist democracies, companies like TATA, Airtel will get their way treating people as dirt while getting to blame the rw as scapegoats.",
        "Must elect an administration experienced candidate as PM, not a Chandrasekhar PM like potential Rahul Gandhi. Having Rahul Gandhi as PM will be accepting of the trend of us embracing people idolised by PR, like Modi. PM role should have civil service, military or CM experience as eligibility.",
        "Those are not exactly coalitions but alliances. Coalition is when opposing ideologies group up. INDIA is an alliance. \n\nEconomy and Stock Market should not be taken into account. The former doesn't care about HDI(gujrat model), the latter only shows the trend for conglomerates like Tata, Reliance and Adani. \n\nEconomic principles that was already established with Narsimha Rao govt was destined to be good early on. Atal government might have trimmed it but people would not realize. When Atal govt failed a year after 2002 riots, stock market went to a major bloodbath thinking it would never recover. So investors were fine with 2002 riots, only private money matters in stock market not the country's economy or development.",
        "Back in 2014, TMC had more LS seats than Congress and the level Congress f'ed up meant there wasn't going to be labelled as legal opposition in parliament. I don't see why Congress should be getting special and national treatment. PM role doesn't matter as much as who all takes up cabinet roles. Maybe not AAP or TMC, but rest of the parties know from history that Congress will eventually make demands on seatsharing or backstab the alliance members beyond their seat capability, and that is what will fail INDIA eventually. People should realize electing congress simply out of anti-incumbency wave and electing lesser of two sycophants is perpetuating the same cycle thats been going on since independence. When regional parties have already formed a national coalition, there should little reason to keep INC relevant anymore just like bhajpa.",
        "Yeah so that Bhajpa and INC alike can do Hindi imposition with no way for people to protest against it.",
        "It really hurts when a naive and internet illiterate heavy population like us can be manipulated so easily by sold media and fake news factory. The ones who are not Falling prey to this should atleast do their bits in throwing the fascists out.",
        ">PM role doesn't matter as much as who all takes up cabinet roles.\n\nThis is where the big fighting is going to happen. Coalition works where a party is in majority and other parties support it with smaller numbers. In case of I.N.D.I.A the Congress will hold as much importance as other parties in terms of numbers and that will result in cabinet reshuffle more often. \n\nAlso, There was a time when Congress was the biggest party in the North but it's their own doing that has led to this. Rahul Gandhi himself lost the election from a seat where Congress was never defeated since independence.",
        "People have been too neutered by social media and workhours to come to the streets. All we do is complain on something online, in line with 24hr news cycle, make witty jokes, get that serotonin suppress our fears and depression and get ready for the next 24hour cycle while jobless sanghi uncles will come to the streets to protect rapists and shit.",
        "Coming out on streets is a one way ticket to jail with NSA/UAPA charges.",
        "How do you rate someone who was never a PM and tell we need better. You had examples from Gujrat of the riots and of fake progress still had no problem making Modi as PM.",
        "Sticking to what our founding fathers thought as idea of India is a better vision by mile than whatever Vikaas vision BJP has.",
        "A nation fundamentally runs on the productivity of its people. A protest is not just for a show but to blockade the functioning of a bad government. How many of the working class can government afford to jail, we already have a brain drain. Even if you are working and not paying tax, your employer is providing a value to the government and so lower paid employees protesting is still reducing the productivity for the government. Yes we have a 1.4billion population and there would be picketing but not without a drop in productivity.",
        "It is a fcked up situation. 18-25 are glued to making comments on social media while 25+ are bogged down by 9-10work hours and family responsibilities. Compare the protests of the 19th and 20th century globally especially India, most were 18-25yo youths, a stark contrast from today. There was once a saying saying in India till the 90s that onion prices can take down the government. It is no longer true.\n\nSchool Education has become like handing prizes to everybody, most gets 80% or 90% easily while curriculum has been getting trimmed for decades now. People get incredibly pampered in India this way feeling sab changa si. They want to be dependent on parents or religion to instruct them what to do. I would not even call people up till 25 to be adults, matured enough to vote or do adult things, same way 16 threshold got increased to 18 once upon a time.",
        "Can you elaborate what you mean by \"pushed the country into an abyss\"? Please add specific examples too.",
        "There will be more planned riots \n\nMore people like Monu Manesar will instigate riots\n\n\n\nEven 2019 was risky they pulled a Pulwama and won",

        "Yes, INDIA has a realistic chance if they keep doing the right thing till the very end without fighting. Also the more confidence they can project, parties that have chosen to be neutral may swing in their favour. Rahul Gandhi obviously, shouldn't and isn't the PM face and as of now they are fighting for some cause without projecting any PM candidate but that will be a major issue. \n\nWhat worries me more is the BJP thinking that they can lose. If they do, they have run out of all cards except to fall back to total Hindutva ergo show of strength by Hindutva outfits which will predictably be followed by violence followed by the BJP winning. It's a tried and tested model for them and it's already happening. Look how they completely changed the states of affairs in Maharashtra (Nashik, Kolhapur, Amravati). Maharashtra was not prone to such communal incidents and suddenly we have a spate of them. Look at Haryana and now the planned 'protests' in Delhi. They will try to keep the country as polarized as possible.",
        "What economic policy from Nehruvian period has pulled Indian economyâ€™s growth as much as Demonitisation? And, what exactly has changed in economic policy since liberalization started by Manmohan as FM other than more liberalization? What kind of economy is better for India is a debatable topic, an economy similar to an European welfare state or that similar to USA that has major wealth disparities and yet has a great GDP and infrastructure but only available for a few.",
        "If course there is a realistic chance, if people of our country find enough courage in their consciousness to take the correct action through their vote.",
        "Welllll there was no growth in the first place to pull it down , demonitisation was an absolute disaster class but lets not kid ourselves that this was the only reason for Indias slowdown, bank lending in india fell off a cliff around 2010 , due to the new bankruptcy code implemented in 2016 , many previous NPA's were caught and banks became extra wary of lending. I am not discounting demonitisation but the people majorly affected by it were the people who were not contributing to the GDP greatly in the first place to put it bluntly , most people with resources got their cash converted at a cost and that did slow us down. \nBefore covid the governments economic policy wasn't great but after covid they have been quite good, before covid all the stories were india is slowing down and no consumer demand etc, now most articles are quite bullish on India with the govts commitment towards building hard Infrastructure in the country, if they build what they are saying they will build it shall be excellent for the country.The UPA presided over the country when we had our best growth figures but they didn't reinvest it into infrastructure they instead went for wealth redistribution (modi has alos done it but not to that extent) , this govt has even in the last full budget before election gone for massive Infra spending, this is what the country requires at the moment.\nThe European welfare state got its money because  of either natural resources Ex: Netherlands or Norway or a massive Industrial base like Germany.\nWe need to get to a certain Gdp per capita before even dreaming about such an extensive welfare and redistribution state. Right now the country would be better served with providing jobs to people with industrialisation rather than helicopter money.",
        "BJP still have some huge opportunities to do a masterstroke.\n1) Ram mandir will open soon and the amount of hype and marketing will be surreal. The only thing which can backfire in this is the possibility of Adavi passing away before the opening. Then I think they may get criticism for not inaugurating the temple earlier. \n2) All important world cup matches are gonna be held in Narendra Modi stadium and Modi ji definitely will do some stunt there to gain clout. If india wins world cup there is gonna be Modi posters every where along with the indian cricket team.\n\nBut I hope people see through these shenanigans this time and vote for the best.",
        "my hope is bjp doesn't get full majority otherwise be prepared for kneejerk decisions with no accountability, remember demo, lockdowns, farm laws etc. They would keep doing it as they are too arrogant to be held accountable in parliament and media is their puppy.\n\nRaga's image has been tarnished by bjp and media for a decade,  listen to his interviews on forums the guy is much more knowledgable and articulate than he's given credit for. I just hope people wake up and reject this gov next year.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "A realistic chance for 2024?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Not a big admirer of Rahul Gandhi, but Indian elections are always about choosing the lesser of the two evils. The way Modi-Shah duo have pushed the country to an abyss is simply terrifying. I was looking at the distribution of the ruling parties in different state and it looks like BJP is on a pretty shaky ground as compared to 2019. While it's true that state election and central elections are fought on a different level, but I.N.D.I.A. still has a realistic chance if they play their cards well. This nightmare has to end, we can let them turn our country into the next Somalia. &#x200B;",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "BJP knows 2024 is going to be challenging because of the opposition uniting. That's why the BJP is trying to pull a Godhra at the national level before the election. Opposition has to not play into their hands and focus the voters attention to the real issues. How much either side is successful remains to be seen. I have very little faith in the voters to vote sensibly but I still get disappointed every election results. I guess we should start by educating people how to strategically vote for a better outcome (i.e. vote for India) instead of wasting their votes doing stupid shit. Somehow people- get the chuckleheads of NDA out in 2024. We will.become the next sub saharan Africa otherwise. Agreed. My parents were Sanghis but post Manipur their perception of the BJP is changing. I think talking with our friends, peers and family members can go a long way. We are all in this together BJP will not get majority like last time but still they will win. We need presidential style elections at the center. biparty system to minimize the chaos. I would start stockpiling food and other necessities, the way things are going, civil unrest is due before the elections or even during them so that elections are called off. BJP is uncomfortable with a united opposition and yes will engineer riots to hold on to vote bank. IMO. DeshDrohi!ðŸ˜‰ Yes. Unless opposition is truly united in fighting for the win. BJP will go mergers and acquisitions route. Yogendra Yadav's predictions, although rare have been quite accurate, which shows his accuracy of analysis. In a very recent interview, he says if I.N.D.I.A focuses on economic issues on the ground, and keeps doing so till '24 then it will be very difficult for bjp to make a comeback. And there are signs that I.N.D.I.A is starting to do it. So there is hope, although not a guarantee The opposition that are you talking about are created by people who are opposion of each other. Defeating Mudi in general elections is next to impossible Education hi toh band kar de rahe sirf propaganda chal raha. I.N.D.I.A must elect a PM candidate and support that person through and through. But BJP can buy MPs in the final lap and win if they need to. When existence is threatened, they may stick together. Still PM Vajpayee was able to form an alliance with radically different parties. The situation in India is too dire and parties have to come together Anything is a step up from fascism Your message also indicates how much easier it is to fool public in the name of hindu muslim riots Punjab is ruled by AAP which is part of INDIA. nope. don't give a name for pm. BJP it cell will start defaming that person. they will start finding any and all shortcomings of the person. so I.N.D.I.A. should postpone it as much as possible. Yes, the electing the PM candidate happens after they have the peopleâ€™s mandate, not before. Absolutely not. India needs to have coalition govts in order to ensure representation. In fact the ECI should start taking action against parties that are turning a representative electoral system into a presidential one. Having a face always help. BJP won by saying \"abki bar Modi Sarkar\" Hopefully the opposition takes notes. BJP likely to win next election. The opposition needs to seriously up their game. We have a representative parliamentary democracy. Espousing presidential concepts, breaks the system that has been put in place. Only the people from the constituency where Modi contested, voted for him, the rest voted for rapists, murderers and crooks all in the name of Modi, and mostly voted against their interests to get BJP to power. The ECI needs to step in and for once in their miserable existence do their job. ECI is a joke. They won't do anything because they can't. They can do a lot. They wonâ€™t is the sad part. Sell outs and corrupt bastards have completely permeated the public sector. Shit, I thought that would be worst case scenario Let me tell you the main problem here. I.N.D.I.A is not even a united opposition. You see all that photo op where everyone is sitting together but then you see news where Sharad Pawar is sharing stage with Modi. Nitish Kumar is pushing his agenda to become a PM face but Congress won't let that happen. TMC convinced AAP to stand with Congress but AAP says it will only support Congress if they in turn support them for the Ordinance bill. Then, you do not have any big party from the north where the major seat sharing is. Congress and SP has minimal presence in Uttar Pradesh and on top of that Owaisi is not part of the coalition which means muslim votes will get distributed wherever he contests on North. And even if I.N.D.I.A somehow achieves the majority. Nitish Kumar, Mamta won't let Congress put forward their PM face which will result in infighting. PS: I watch Saurabh Dwivedi's Netanagiri to gain all this knowledge and these are not my personal views. For starters, voters like you have to unite and throw them out. This is as much a fight that opposition has to fight that a common man like you has to fight. For the opposition to win, it has to win big. Otherwise you are going to have horse trading and them disintegrating. Plus, two of the 'Other' states you have mentioned is already in BJPs pockets. So, like others have mentioned, BJP is going to win but with lesser majority. Which states are already in their pockets ? Agree. Every rational thinking person has to get the disinterested/ fence-sitters to see reason and vote. It is on us. See the Gurgaon riots. Create a riot-conducive atmosphere. Don't pre-empt riots. Later blame minorities. *we _can't_ let them turn our country into the next Somalia. FTFY My favorite KRK movie How though ? You telling me Delhi Congress & Punjab would be fine with playing second fiddle to AAP ? Or CPI would be fine with giving all seats in Bengal to TMC ? It's extremely difficult to see such long time rivalries not playing a spoil sport. They may get enough seats to force BJP into a modi-less coalition. But thats as far as I expect them to go. Purely form economic perspective and taking stock market as an indication of growth.. We are going to see bloodbath on the finance side if at all BJP cant get a clear majority with hung state. The opposition , the way it is today is nothing less than a noodle soup. they cant pull off forming a stable govt. PS: I am not a bhakt not a mudi fan Adapt or cease to exist. Else, BJP is expert in Mergers and Acquisitions. I.N.D.I.A is a big Noo as of now. I have listed reasons and things they can improve on. It doesn't make sense for them politically and RaGa is a joker. He benefits BJP more than he does to his own party. Here's my concern with I.N.D.I.A 1. The name didn't invoke a sense of nationalism in people, as they had expected. Rather people are expecting them to do better, so to become good enough to be worthy of voting. No one wants I.N.D.I.A. to win the elections. They either want the BJP to win, or they want the BJP to lose. 2. Seat sharing during Lok Sabha elections is going to be a mess. It's not just about who gets how many. It's also about who gets which ones? 3. It makes it easy for the BJP to target them. Earlier they had to fight with every party, now it's all in one alliance so they just need to imply that the entire alliance is not good enough. On a local level, a BJP candidate who had to fight with multiple opponents will now fight with one. The country is desperately looking for options. I.N.D.I.A reduced them further. 4. Coming to RaGa because apparently he is the PM candidate. Remember in 2019 he became a shiv bhakt before elections? yeah he is that stupid and people are not. If he does something like that again, The alliance is gone. Here are a few things I.N.D.I.A should promise to raise support (my opinion) 1. Strict New Law to make it difficult for the ruling party to go MLA shopping. Also, Explain what that law would be. 2. Expose the weakness of this government, The National Security. And no, I don't mean china. I mean these violent riots. How did Seema enter. Raise the issue of drugs in Sikkim, Jammu and Punjab. Paint it a national issue, not a regional one. 3. A strict new law to make sure the ruling party cannot control the media the way it does today. 4. A clear economic policy. No freebies please. They need to understand that people are loving infrastructure building and Congress needs to promise that. 5. A very difficult demand and hence optional, but can turn the tides. Promise to make top ranking officers the ministers. Make it clear that there would be no internal struggle for ministry offices because we won't take any. We would offer it based on the qualification of people. The question is, Can they do this one? India deserves better than Modi or Rahul. Atal and manmohan years were coalition governments. Economy in those times was far better than today They won't win. But will they play all their dirty tricks to hold on to power, is a totally different question. Cast your Vote right people! All the people posting about leaving the country must understand they need to make themselves count if they wish their family & friends to live in a safe, peaceful & progressive country. Usually People who are swayed by religion politics are left behind and are also the ones who make their votes count. you are comparing that coalition with the current one. phew! Yes, it most certainly is on us. I won't wait for an XYZ opposition group to educate me on what's going on inside my own country. It's my responsibility to aid my country in eliminating the threat to democracy it's currently facing. If they care at all about â€˜INDIAâ€™, theyâ€™ll need to realize they are fighting for something bigger than themselves! You overestimate the loyalty of these opposition parties. Genuine question, what unites them? Other than their hatred of the BJP? There isnâ€™t a single unifying ideology or plan that brings them together. The only reason they are together is they donâ€™t like the BJP and want power for themselves. One phone call from Amit Shah post election and many of the small parties will jump ship if the offer is good. Itâ€™s a matter of price, they are just trying to increase their price for that eventual phone call from Shah. You cannot rely on these hotchpotch clown car of opportunists, dynasts and crooks who will jump ship at one offer from Amit Shah. Congress needs to become stronger, these regional parties are not reliable The map does not display all INDIA run states. It is missing Punjab (AAP), WB (TMC), and Kerala (Left parties). [This img][updated image] is more accurate. [img]: this is a easy wager, BJP is for sure coming back in 2024, the worst thing entire opposition did was to unite under 1 umbrella, it feels more like a desperate bid to keep Modi at bay rather then focusing of development and empowerment. Moreover the likes of who & who under this I.N.D.I.A, have already been rejected multiple times in previous polls by masses, not sure has changed time time for them. Until some of them are paid handsomely to switch sides or make breakaway parties post election. Or have the Governor/President choose bhajpa for 6hours at early morning without any notification just to get shitty ordinances passed. The shenanigans bhajpa had been doing in MH since 2014 has been a rollercoaster and are hints as to what they can do. Just yesterday, a study found Bhajpa had disproportionately high wins in recounting everywhere. They won't stop at anything. Rahul Gandhi has no vision to present to the country his only platform is that he is not modi , he is trying to pull a Joe Biden but Indias electoral realities are different and an anti-modi campaign will not work. He has to present something positive but the best the congress has to offer until now has been outcompeting BJP on freebies and now Karnataka doesn't have Infrastructure budget for a year . The I.N.D.I.A alliance acronym did take the BJP by surprise but the most important thing for the alliance is not to decide a leader nor come up with a common minimum mission but the seat share , lets see how power hungry politicians decide to share their seats , if they work this out without any last minute squabbling they may stand a chance but their chances of getting a majority are near zero Unless Congress stops backstabbing other parties, people will keep having low faith in coalitions and will vote for a \"directioned\" party instead, no matter how bad is the direction. That was the talk pre-2014 post 26/11 after people demanded war. 24hour news cycle shows voters forget demonetisation woes, fake surgical strikes, covid bodies by the Ganges by the time they have to answer a single 5yearly multiple choice question. The only real way people can press their will on the government is by protesting on the streets the moment such incidents happen. It is a real shame people can congregate and protest for wrong reasons, like gujjars can protest for reservations, people can protest to free rapists but the sane ones won't congregate to protest. Otherwise voting in democracy is just to see which party has slightly more legitimacy to prevent riots. That is after all the philosophy of voting for the lesser evil, as seen in US, UK where anti-people laws get passed during rw governments but rarely repealed when the left forms government. In captalist democracies, companies like TATA, Airtel will get their way treating people as dirt while getting to blame the rw as scapegoats. Must elect an administration experienced candidate as PM, not a Chandrasekhar PM like potential Rahul Gandhi. Having Rahul Gandhi as PM will be accepting of the trend of us embracing people idolised by PR, like Modi. PM role should have civil service, military or CM experience as eligibility. Those are not exactly coalitions but alliances. Coalition is when opposing ideologies group up. INDIA is an alliance. Economy and Stock Market should not be taken into account. The former doesn't care about HDI(gujrat model), the latter only shows the trend for conglomerates like Tata, Reliance and Adani. Economic principles that was already established with Narsimha Rao govt was destined to be good early on. Atal government might have trimmed it but people would not realize. When Atal govt failed a year after 2002 riots, stock market went to a major bloodbath thinking it would never recover. So investors were fine with 2002 riots, only private money matters in stock market not the country's economy or development. Back in 2014, TMC had more LS seats than Congress and the level Congress f'ed up meant there wasn't going to be labelled as legal opposition in parliament. I don't see why Congress should be getting special and national treatment. PM role doesn't matter as much as who all takes up cabinet roles. Maybe not AAP or TMC, but rest of the parties know from history that Congress will eventually make demands on seatsharing or backstab the alliance members beyond their seat capability, and that is what will fail INDIA eventually. People should realize electing congress simply out of anti-incumbency wave and electing lesser of two sycophants is perpetuating the same cycle thats been going on since independence. When regional parties have already formed a national coalition, there should little reason to keep INC relevant anymore just like bhajpa. Yeah so that Bhajpa and INC alike can do Hindi imposition with no way for people to protest against it. It really hurts when a naive and internet illiterate heavy population like us can be manipulated so easily by sold media and fake news factory. The ones who are not Falling prey to this should atleast do their bits in throwing the fascists out. >PM role doesn't matter as much as who all takes up cabinet roles. This is where the big fighting is going to happen. Coalition works where a party is in majority and other parties support it with smaller numbers. In case of I.N.D.I.A the Congress will hold as much importance as other parties in terms of numbers and that will result in cabinet reshuffle more often. Also, There was a time when Congress was the biggest party in the North but it's their own doing that has led to this. Rahul Gandhi himself lost the election from a seat where Congress was never defeated since independence. People have been too neutered by social media and workhours to come to the streets. All we do is complain on something online, in line with 24hr news cycle, make witty jokes, get that serotonin suppress our fears and depression and get ready for the next 24hour cycle while jobless sanghi uncles will come to the streets to protect rapists and shit. Coming out on streets is a one way ticket to jail with NSA/UAPA charges. How do you rate someone who was never a PM and tell we need better. You had examples from Gujrat of the riots and of fake progress still had no problem making Modi as PM. Sticking to what our founding fathers thought as idea of India is a better vision by mile than whatever Vikaas vision BJP has. A nation fundamentally runs on the productivity of its people. A protest is not just for a show but to blockade the functioning of a bad government. How many of the working class can government afford to jail, we already have a brain drain. Even if you are working and not paying tax, your employer is providing a value to the government and so lower paid employees protesting is still reducing the productivity for the government. Yes we have a 1.4billion population and there would be picketing but not without a drop in productivity. It is a fcked up situation. 18-25 are glued to making comments on social media while 25+ are bogged down by 9-10work hours and family responsibilities. Compare the protests of the 19th and 20th century globally especially India, most were 18-25yo youths, a stark contrast from today. There was once a saying saying in India till the 90s that onion prices can take down the government. It is no longer true. School Education has become like handing prizes to everybody, most gets 80% or 90% easily while curriculum has been getting trimmed for decades now. People get incredibly pampered in India this way feeling sab changa si. They want to be dependent on parents or religion to instruct them what to do. I would not even call people up till 25 to be adults, matured enough to vote or do adult things, same way 16 threshold got increased to 18 once upon a time. Can you elaborate what you mean by \"pushed the country into an abyss\"? Please add specific examples too. There will be more planned riots More people like Monu Manesar will instigate riots Even 2019 was risky they pulled a Pulwama and won INDIA could win easily if they manage to get Mayavati, KCR and Jagan on board. They can still win without these but itâ€™ll be tough Why not Sachin Pilot , why not Supriya Srinet or Shashi Tharoor for PM They all are more experienced and qualified then him Why only Rahul Asking CPI to adapt is basically asking them to die in Bengal, it's not as black and white as you think. I know. I am sure there are issues even in Kerala with INC Vs CPM. But, if either of them wins, it is good enough for the support of a non-BJP Govt. We can't sit on our hands and hope INDIA Alliance delivers. We need to get out, organized, protest, call out, shame, and convince people to not vote for the absolute worst option destroying this country. >Asking CPI to adapt is basically asking them to die in Bengal, Nope. They can still fight against tmc at state and local levels, just not at national level till the menace of bjp is finished. Chahe ho jaye vote toh Modi ji ko hi denge Enough states are under the rule of Congress for the last 9 years and they have done nothing impressive there. Just because BJP has been horrible, it does not mean that Congress becomes automatically great. Congress is way better especially at the center. How old are you? Manmohan singh ran a competent govt before BJP and Kejriwal just spread propoganda. If ministers were corrupt, they got convicted. They still haven't played all their cards. Who knows what nightmare will haunt us in this one year ðŸ˜” You mean Murders and Executions? /s I don't get the obsession with founding fathers whether its here or anywhere else in the world , they lived in a completely different era, their realities were completely different than ours . While the social integration thoughts of our founding fathers was better than the BJP their economic policies were terrible and they tried to be extra smart with their foreign policy, I am not saying the BJP is better in these regards but just pointing out that they weren't as great as our history textbooks would like us to believe, everyone has flaws and Indias founding fathers had some major ones BJD and YSCRP Just because opposition doesnâ€™t have pm candidate doesnâ€™t mean modi should win. Imagine hitler asking if not hitler than who . Country is run by institutions which modi destroyed and made in to just 2. Everything is controlled by modisha. If someone from opposition comes then power will be shared with institutions and Supreme Court and states and not just the two Yes, INDIA has a realistic chance if they keep doing the right thing till the very end without fighting. Also the more confidence they can project, parties that have chosen to be neutral may swing in their favour. Rahul Gandhi obviously, shouldn't and isn't the PM face and as of now they are fighting for some cause without projecting any PM candidate but that will be a major issue. What worries me more is the BJP thinking that they can lose. If they do, they have run out of all cards except to fall back to total Hindutva ergo show of strength by Hindutva outfits which will predictably be followed by violence followed by the BJP winning. It's a tried and tested model for them and it's already happening. Look how they completely changed the states of affairs in Maharashtra (Nashik, Kolhapur, Amravati). Maharashtra was not prone to such communal incidents and suddenly we have a spate of them. Look at Haryana and now the planned 'protests' in Delhi. They will try to keep the country as polarized as possible. What economic policy from Nehruvian period has pulled Indian economyâ€™s growth as much as Demonitisation? And, what exactly has changed in economic policy since liberalization started by Manmohan as FM other than more liberalization? What kind of economy is better for India is a debatable topic, an economy similar to an European welfare state or that similar to USA that has major wealth disparities and yet has a great GDP and infrastructure but only available for a few. If course there is a realistic chance, if people of our country find enough courage in their consciousness to take the correct action through their vote. Welllll there was no growth in the first place to pull it down , demonitisation was an absolute disaster class but lets not kid ourselves that this was the only reason for Indias slowdown, bank lending in india fell off a cliff around 2010 , due to the new bankruptcy code implemented in 2016 , many previous NPA's were caught and banks became extra wary of lending. I am not discounting demonitisation but the people majorly affected by it were the people who were not contributing to the GDP greatly in the first place to put it bluntly , most people with resources got their cash converted at a cost and that did slow us down. Before covid the governments economic policy wasn't great but after covid they have been quite good, before covid all the stories were india is slowing down and no consumer demand etc, now most articles are quite bullish on India with the govts commitment towards building hard Infrastructure in the country, if they build what they are saying they will build it shall be excellent for the country.The UPA presided over the country when we had our best growth figures but they didn't reinvest it into infrastructure they instead went for wealth redistribution (modi has alos done it but not to that extent) , this govt has even in the last full budget before election gone for massive Infra spending, this is what the country requires at the moment. The European welfare state got its money because of either natural resources Ex: Netherlands or Norway or a massive Industrial base like Germany. We need to get to a certain Gdp per capita before even dreaming about such an extensive welfare and redistribution state. Right now the country would be better served with providing jobs to people with industrialisation rather than helicopter money. BJP still have some huge opportunities to do a masterstroke. 1) Ram mandir will open soon and the amount of hype and marketing will be surreal. The only thing which can backfire in this is the possibility of Adavi passing away before the opening. Then I think they may get criticism for not inaugurating the temple earlier. 2) All important world cup matches are gonna be held in Narendra Modi stadium and Modi ji definitely will do some stunt there to gain clout. If india wins world cup there is gonna be Modi posters every where along with the indian cricket team. But I hope people see through these shenanigans this time and vote for the best. my hope is bjp doesn't get full majority otherwise be prepared for kneejerk decisions with no accountability, remember demo, lockdowns, farm laws etc. They would keep doing it as they are too arrogant to be held accountable in parliament and media is their puppy. Raga's image has been tarnished by bjp and media for a decade, listen to his interviews on forums the guy is much more knowledgable and articulate than he's given credit for. I just hope people wake up and reject this gov next year. Coal scam, 2G scam, commonwealth scam, railways scam, shall I keep going on or you got the gist? Just fyi not one person accused in the 2G scam was found guilty. Every single accused person was acquitted. The court ruled that the case was baseless. And if people still think that there was weight to that case, like you've just demonstrated, it means that BJPs propaganda machinery has done its job. No, I didnt. Many of them were not scams. Some of them were and courts sentenced people. You have to read about individual cases and how they ended. BJP and kejru just fooled people by repeating scam names. Indians were really get I to details and keep parroting. >You cant blame congress for corruption alone. Okay then why should anyone choose Congress over BJP, if corruption is everyone's faults then so does everything else as well. Don't choose. I am not here for stupid arguments. Vote BJP and enjoy the lynching show. You are doing false equivalence, and either disingenuous or plain stupid. Did you read what happened to those scams? Modi will win. Indians don't deserve freedom as it requires sacrifice that was never paid. It was given by British for free and squandered very easily. There will be subjugation for centuries like there always was. Sometimes by mughals, sometimes based on caste, women lynchings. I mean in which country on earth sati like practice existed in 20th century or 19th or 18th. Discrimination within same race based on caste. May be start by looking at your past to understand who we really were. Their 2nd masterstroke completely backfired ðŸ¤­"
