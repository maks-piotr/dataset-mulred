We are in process to send it to 11  indian states.\n\nWhile Martinellis is only available in North America and Europe, there is a huge market gap for our product in Gulf countries, South Asia, China and South East Asia. I believe our apple juice has the potential to become a household name in these regions. If you're interested, I can send you some samples for you to try. I would love your help in expanding our product in these markets.",

Not taking any hard-work away from him, but we gotta acknowledge the importance of luck too. \nLike It turns out that University of Washington, conveniently was across the street from high school, had the next level computer he needed. There he met Paul Allen who became his partner 4 years later.\nNo doubt that Gates had an extraordinary aptitude for programming and software development. However a few things did lined up for him.",

        "Hi Brendan,\n\nAs a founder, I am excited to introduce you to our innovative startup, Prayaan Media. Our mission is to revolutionize the in-auto entertainment and advertising industry in India, which we believe is a major problem in the country.\n\nWe have identified that only 1% of the 150,000 auto-rickshaws in Hyderabad have pre-built speakers, and those that do often play music that is too loud or inappropriate for passengers. We aim to solve this problem by installing high-quality Bluetooth speakers in every auto-rickshaw and providing drivers with a playlist curated by our team. This will enhance the in-auto experience for passengers and create a new source of income for drivers.\n\nOur solution not only addresses the problem of low-quality in-auto entertainment but also creates a cost-effective and efficient advertising platform for businesses. Advertisers can purchase promotional slots within the playlist to reach their target audience in a cost-effective manner. Passengers can enjoy a better in-auto experience, and drivers will receive a fixed amount per hour for playing the playlist. It is a win-win situation for everyone involved.\n\nWe have already launched our MVP and have on-boarded 10 autos with an average of 5 hours of playtime per day. In the last month alone, we paid out Rs.1600 to our drivers. We have also approached 100+ advertisers, out of which 10 have shown interest, and 2 have already given their ads in our startup.\n\nOur revenue projections show that we have the potential to capture a significant market share in the Indian advertising industry, which is currently worth approximately $15 billion. We plan to leverage social media channels to increase brand awareness and reach potential customers, partner with popular music streaming services to create curated playlists, and offer referral bonuses for both advertisers and drivers to increase adoption.\n\nAs a founder, I am confident that Prayaan Media has the potential to make a significant impact in the in-auto entertainment and advertising industry in India. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to know more about our startup, please don't hesitate to contact me at [**anil.02missile@gmail.com**](mailto:anil.02missile@gmail.com).",
        "Personally I’m a huge fan of heavy industries, I do have a family background in it, so oil and gas, metals, mining, ports/logistics, power, etc. are things right up my alley\n\nMy mum actually heads a VC fund and was telling how VCs generally fund only asset light businesses, so I was j curious if that was the case here as well.",
        "no thoughts...",
        "Looking for work Brendan. I'm unemployed. Can ya pls help me?",
        "yes it's mostly the case at least for us and our coinvestors.",
        "what's your skill sets - i love recruiting",
        "Makes sense considering that at most Indian companies love defaulting on loans, especially the big corporates",
        "What do you hate about India and think usa does better?",
        "Apologies if I wasn't clear.  I was asking about your POV on the RMG industry and its future potential. Not if you personally played real money skill games.",
        "Brendan, since you write about the growth story of India -\n\nDo you think we messed up by moving from an agricultural country and jumped to a services country and completely skipped manufacturing?\n\nWhat can be done to course correct and would you invest in a B2B manufacturing company that's digitizing the industry?",
        "Right, but most startups don’t even follow Indian law. They don’t pay overtime either.",
        "Hi Brendan - I've actually invested in BizzTM through LetsVenture. Remember Anupam Mittal being one of the backers. How are they doing? Don't receive any updates/MIS from them.",
        "What should a aerospace manufacturing startup do to get funding?\n\nIt’s capital intense, slow and boring, less VCs and trust issues from prospective clients because everyone thinks aerospace is difficult. \n\nWhich it is, BUT there’s a big market requirement.\n\nBTW- we have the prototypes tested and ready for scaling.\nPeople just won’t believe us without a big brand buddy alongside.",
        "If any of your startups need branding, I can be of help ; ). and sorry for pitching like this 🙏🏻",
        "Hey I’d also like to try some, can you give me some more info?",
        "Does the Adani scam/grift change the perception of India as an investment destination in the minds of foreign investors like you?",
        "Hii I m 20 ys old now n confused between so many things  like I m currently pursuing b.com n company secretary course. and also loves to participate in other events but the time management is a lot and also interested in learning many more things like stock market etc.. but don't know should wait or just focus on one of now or I m going good?"

    "light_cleaned_title": "Hey r/India, India startup venture investor Brendan Rogers here. Ask Me Anything!",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Hi I’m Brendan Rogers and I plan to dedicate the next 25 years of my life speaking with thousands of Indian founders and investing in the very best of them. I grew up in a small east coast american township in Rhode Island. Moved to Palo Alto when I was 21. Cofounded wag! the largest on demand pet tech company in the US. It is a listed company on the nasdaq. I went to India end of 2019 and it was love at first sight. 4 years later, I’ve invested in 40+ Indian startups, I have a Sanskrit tattoo, study Hindu philosophy, and eat biriyani every week. I love speaking about the India growth story, entrepreneurship, venture capital, and everything else startups. Feel free to ask me anything!",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "what was your proudest investment? What does your tattoo say? What was the moment you realized that you were in love with India? What's the story behind the name 2am VC ? Something to do with timezones? Hey Brendan Do you invest in pre-revenue startups? Hi Brendan. What is the average fund size for your investments? What are your preferred investment sectors and how can I get invested in my startup by you? What are some sectors you want to go hot in the next 3-4 years? How would you say you are different from the big name Sand Hill Road VCs when deciding what to invest in? How we can sell agrochemicals online in India directly to farmers We are trying build around this What are the non-negotiables you look for in startup founders? Why invest in India and not the US? We are delivering groceries directly to farmers at their farms and want to go into agrochemicals What types of startups do you typically invest in, and what industries or sectors are you particularly interested in? I tried to apply for 2am cohort but rejected because we are on very early stage Hi Brendan! What's been your favourite Indian start-up story yet? Are Indian startups overvalued right now? Hi Brendan, Thanks for doing the AMA. We are from Bananas Academy, a game studio that makes mixed reality software and hardware, currently working on developing the first consumer haptic glove for VR. As a venture capital investor with a focus on India, we are curious about your investment strategy in the VR (Virtual Reality) space. Here are some questions we have: 1. What are your thoughts on the potential of VR technology in India, and how do you see it evolving in the coming years? 2. Have you made any investments in VR startups in India? If so, what are some notable ones, and what attracted you to those companies? 3. If VR technology aligns with your investment interests, we are planning to raise a Pre-seed round in Q2. What's the best way to reach you to discuss potential investment opportunities? We are excited to hear your insights and experiences as a VC investor in the VR space in India during your AMA on [r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India/)! Thank you. Best regards, Ajay from Bananas Academy What should Silicon Valley startups learn from India? What do you think sets Indian start-ups apart from those originating elsewhere? What are the things that attracted you the most about this country? And the things you kind of miss when you travel other places? One of the many things India needs to grow is hardware. Since your core value is the future of India, would you be interested in investing in hardware+software startups? What's next for you after Leicester? Your view on indian pet tech? Lmao wrong Brendon Rogers What food did you enjoy most in India? Follow up: what sweet? Good day....I'm not able to find the link for the live session with Brendan ...i had no choice but to connect with you...we ve been trying for 45 minutes...how did you go online and access the video session? What sectors are you most excited about in India right now? Thoughts on FinTech? How can I pitch an idea to you? What are some of your portfolio companies from India? Hey Brendan, I am a founder building in the special education software space in India. What's the best way to reach you? Also, would you be interested in knowing about this in the concept stage or do you guys only invest in startups with traction? Hoping to hear from you! 😊 I really am in awe of your vision of investing in India and its startups. 🚀 $250K, we are sector agnostic, looking for companies that are very scaleable. It has to be a moon shot. Hey Brendan, love what you and Hershel are doing at 2AM ventures. Wanted to ask if a automated expense manager would work for india. Where all expenses are tracked by the app and budgeting savings tips are provided. We want to bring down the entire hassle of expense management, ITR filing and investing for the next generation. Will this idea work? I am from Mumbai would love to meet you guys. Lmk if something is possible. Thanks India founders are the toughest most passionate founders I have met. Hi Brendan, Question from an investee founder at [KloudMate](https://www.kloudmate.com). 1. Do you participate in follow-on rounds of your portfolio companies? 2. Have you ever had a silly yet mad argument with your cofounder, Hershel? 😁 3. Cats or Dogs / Mountains or beaches? There are too many to count, I am proud of all of the investments 2am VC has made. The next one will be my favorite. We are actively investing now! WE ARE WRITING CHECKS! Of course, we look at pre-revenue, pre-product. We love investing on Word Docs :). What are the challenges you have faced while you are investing here in India? Could you please share one incident and how did you solved it? Thanks in advance There are so many sectors that I am very bullish on. Ed-tech, Fashion Tech, health Tech etc. I will look at all sectors. What is the model for portfolio due diligence in your firm? Do you exercise a high level or control or are you very comfortable trusting the founders completely? $250K SAIF or Equity? Usually how long you take to transfer funds after documentation & terms are confirmed? Hi Brendan! How often do people get you confused with the Northern Irish football manager? We move faster, you talk to a GP on the first call and we can be more patience. Every investment matters for us, unlike the big firms. Does having an MBA degree make a startup founder more credible and hence more likely to get an investment? Hey. What's your favourite beverage? Is there a tool that exists in the market which gives read receipts for email sent to vc's/dm on insta or other channels. If yes please help me wit the name of the tool. Point being how does 2am.vc manage communication sent from founders on a investable venture. It shouldn't become a part of the anti portfolio Hi Brendan, what was it about India that has kept you here for the last 3+ years? Have to be willing to sacrifice everything to win, hyper focused on the business and problem. For someone looking to get into VC for job role, what advise would you give in terms of qualifications, skillset etc they should chase? Please be specific to the Indian ecosystem. What are the top 3 things you look at in a startup before investing? How can founders reach you? Hi Brendon, we are building AcadSpace - Google Map for Career Preparation using AI to personalize a career preparation journey for the GenZ. How do I reach you to chat more on this? :) It's not a video session. You can ask your question here in comments. Brendan is answering questions here! Kunal Bahl story, studying in the US , working at Microsoft but ending back up in India building Snapdeal. One of the best start-up stories I have ever heard. Also did you read yoga vashista. It was my personal recommendation as you had referenced the Gita sometime back \"Every step of the journey, is the journey.\" Hey Brendan ! I'm currently 17yr old. I wish to create my own startup after I'm done with college. Could you please share some things that I should spend my time on in college ( potentially going to US for my undergrad ) to come out as a better fit for my future plan ? Thanks ! Hey Brendan, What are your favorite sectors to invest in? What are the things that you look for the most in the company/founders? What areas of technology do you find most interesting? How big do you plan to build out your team to? Hey Mr. Rogers! I want to ask, What made you choose India over other profitable rivals? Do you have a subreddit we can join? Makes sense. Best wishes. When I landed in Mumbai for the very first time, seeing everyone hustling. What's the one that got away? Start-up/early investment opportunity, that is The craziest things in my startup journey as always been at 2am! It's the investors and employees who are up with you at 2am. Yo Brendan, not a question, just a shout out and appreciation for being an awesome investor in GoodGameNation from day 0. Actually, question - would you say anything is holding India's potential back? Vs what you saw in the valley? Hi again, Brendan! Who is your favorite Indian Gen-Z founder? And what do you think we can learn from them? (Since you mentioned ed-tech in interests) Do you agree with the perception that current Indian ed-tech players have become predatory marketing organisatios selling a dream to vulnerable parents? What would your ideal ed-tech venture be trying to solve in the sector in India? What do you think of the food weaning industry in India? We were planning to launch a startup based on a high fibre ingredient Hey Brendan, been hearing that the landscape of micro investing in India is looking bright over the next decade. Any apps here you recommend that may be in your portfolio? It's been 5 years since I started a business. I've heard 1000+ No s and not a single yes from a single legit investor. Does a good pedigree really that important? P.s. I don't come from a wealthy background or have a good pedigree. What do startups write as their TAM in their pitch decks? Has anyone been shockingly honest and come out with a relatively low TAM? Why are most Indian start-ups facing losses? Thank you for hosting an AMA. Hey Brendan, How do we reach out to you? Hello Brendon, I might sound funny, but this is the question I have in my mind. Do startups tend to be made from \"ideas-to-funding\" or from \"funding-to-ideas\" ? Like sometimes ideas needed to be bended just for funding. R/pitchto2amvc 🙌🙌🚀🇮🇳 Do your investments come with conditions ? Like equity? Hey Brendan, how do you look at slow-growth-yet-profitable vs felt-crazy-growth-might-profit-later strategy? (Asking since startups serving mass consumer products in India are having a very hard time turning profitable at scale) Hi Brendan, How do u handle the conflict of interest for investing in startups in the same domain like solving the same problem or do u refrain from such overlap I think its a growing market and will be massive in the next 5 to 10 years. What financial shenanigans have you seen with Indian startups? VC-backed startups are meant to be world-shattering and innovative. They will need to spend some money to get there. Short term thinkers never win. Thanks for doing this Ama, i hope you are doing well!! Question: What sectors of the start-up industry in India do you consider to have promising potential for the future? Additionally, have you exclusively invested in start-ups located in metropolitan areas, or have you also observed any promising ventures from small towns in India?\" I have not but now I will be reading on my next long flight. Thank you! One of my bucket-list places to visit is Adi Yoga statue. Then you should think about the business more and if you need VC money. Small TAMs do not equate to good VC outcomes. If you are building a lifestyle business - avoid wasting your time with VCs Hi Brendan, Nice to meet you can you help me to make next 1000cr company. unknown to me... but happy to learn :) Hi Brendan What must a young fresher such as myself invest in to make my money work for me. Should we make long term investments or short-term. And what percentage of our salary must we keep aside for investment purposes? Thanks Hi Brendan, We are happy to have such enthusiastic person to help and grow our indian startup ecosystem. We are a financial advisory company which helps startups in their financial management and in fund raising. Kindly let us know how we can get associated with you. Best Regards, Team Ekara Third Wave Coffee What's the future of HR?? Hey Brendan, is healthcare a preferred sector for you, and if yes, what is your outlook on the medical devices sector - there are several opportunities in the value chain in India. in the works study people, understand pain points, surround yourself with the best people... and be humble. How is life after getting fired from the leister city job, hope you get a new one soon, cheers mate How to stay up at 2am and stay lean. Hey Brendan, how do I send you a pitch deck and get a conversation? Mango lassi , and Kingfisher. Hey brendan, I have a couple of business ideas which I currently see no one exploring specially in India and I'm pretty sure they will be a huge market, I'm extremely passionate about it but limited due to my financial situation. Do you invest in ideas and help them turn into startups which can do extremely well depending on what it is? If not, what do you suggest for someone who wants to start and get your investment. Thanks in advance. The amazing people who have accepted me for who I am. Sucky coffees though We had reached out to you a pitchdeck on our product to your email id...do look into it Hi Brendan, What are thoughts about doing a rollup of acquisitions in an industry and gain market share through M&A. And would you be interested in funding one? Karbon Card, Apna Mart, GoSats, Bluelearn , Salaybox , [Newme.Asia](https://Newme.Asia) and more! How can I pitch my idea to you ? Mumbai City FC. Brendan, which one do you prefer in general b2c or b2b ? I actually played soccer in college at the highest level. Should I try out for Mumbai City? Hi roger, do you invest only in IT or interested in pharma sector as well I prefer both! I only care about backing passionate determined founders. >For someone looking to get into VC for job role, what advise would you give in terms of qualifications, skillset etc they should chase? Please be specific to the Indian ecosystem. tough to manage so much in bound... but we are always looking to investment- so if you can't grab our attention, it's more indicative than if we responded and passed. It has been good. Watch out for me at Mumbai City FC. Go Mumbai! Brendan how often do you get mistaken for the former Leicester city manager What makes someone's passion successful? Hello Brendan , hope you are doing well.. Ever been to south India? Book recommendation for you - MALGUDI DAYS by R.K.NARAYAN (Set during pre-independence & past independence), you'll like it & get to know more about south India Hey Understandable. But how much actually can one absorb of a deck.. Hi Brendan. Where next after Leicester City? And who do you think is likely to be relegated from the Premier League now? (excluding Leicester ofc) Not as much as Johnny Sins. Hey! Hows your evening going? Cute. Take care. the best is BS is fake reviews from fake accounts \"JackJill1232324 - this app is great\" and then bragging about the number of downloads AI What all key ideas your investing in web3? Yes for the Dosa's! I need to explore more. I will add this book to my list. Thank you! Biotech will eat the world soon... Hey Brendan. Is it true that funding is mainly based on the people you are investing in rather than the idea? If so, do entrepreneurs who have an degree from prestigious college or high achievement have high chance of funding than a average college or with low achievement person? Also what industries do you think will be booming in future The only team that matters is Mumbai City FC. Yes... but i am not experienced so you will have to convince me and it will be harder than software solution - sorry about that! whats ur email ? asking for a person i know who wants funding in his startup get in touch with me on LinkedIn - have to get my attention on the platform tho Also we got a SUB REDDIT!!! - woot woot [https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchTo2amVC/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PitchTo2amVC/) With all the AI coming around, Would you invest in a non AI startup with good customer base? Sectors we love: Consumer, Supply chain, Logistics, FOOD, Upskilling Fintech is hard... but there is money to be made Subscribed. Thanks for your response! I am working on the prototype. Will contact you soon! And possibly convince you as well 😄 some... yes... some no... we invest very early with conviction and are price sensitive. The best companies I have seen have an amazing idea and founders who are willing to sacrifice everything to make it work. BRB asking the Ambanis to hire you as their star striker Please use our subreddit: r/PitchTo2amVC >Thanks WORK HARD... and find work that either has the purpose or that doesn't feel like work. But whatever you do - be the best at it. Hi Do u have existing investment in India for waste management which is a big problem Of course, a business is nothing without customers. We refrain but sometimes it's out of our control due to pivots... what would you do? Another question, If you think a founder working on an idea is amazing and the market for it is really good and scalable, but founder is solo, would you invest in that startup? meta verse I do not, but would love to learn more. Feel free to share at r/PitchTo2amVC Hey u/gobharat, would you be open to be a part of community of founders from India who are seeking funding? I have just dropped you a DM on LinkedIn for our start-up Idea. Let's uplift the start-up ecosystem together too saturated of a market imo. Competition is for losers - try to build where no one is building Would you be interested in funding a game development studio? Yes we will consider but I prefer multiple co-founders. You can move faster with more! Gaming is a massive space I believe will grow even more so yes would be very interested. I thought you are the ex Leicester city manager lol my bad 1) We would if it makes sense... if the company moves quickly upstream sometimes we get priced out. 2) Every day... if you don't have silly fights with your cofounders you aren't spending enough time together. I am a groomsman at Hershel's wedding - we have met each other's, extended family. 3) Dogs - I am part golden retriever, part human. Hi Brendan!! I am a chartered accountant working as a full stack VC in a govt promoted VC firm. Is there any chance that I could join your team? Would love to work with you!! true innovation is currently less... but not for long. India's time is coming!!! All good! He could lose a few pounds though :) True! Thanks for your response! This AMA has been amazing. I am reading all your comments on each question. I am not Indian... yet. There are tons of nuances that I am still learning. I went deep into tech around the gold and jewelry industry and we finally did a gold e-commerce company - goldsetu. TBH - we used to not care as much but now we do... the market has changed and if you don't adapt you die. Hi Brendan, What Indian languages you can speak? Who will you manage next Brendan after Leicester sacked you? Or are you planning to take a sabbatical? Hey man 😟🫂 I am slowly learning Hindi. Hi Brendan, What are your favourite video games? Would you fund if we take innovative ideas which succeeded in the west and reimplement them here ! no - we tend not invest in MBA's unless they are very technical. MBA's are great operators, but we feel that great founders don't spend time learning business... they spend time building business Hi Brendan What are your views on the Pet industry in India? As I see you are already a founder of Wag!! Will you be able to invest in a similar industry? Thanks for replying! After working for corporate America I have been looking into working for start up. Electrical Engineer with 10 years of experience in Telecom Industry (3 years as project manager). Give me an offer that I cant refuse. Can relocate to NY. Have US Green Card so no sponsorship needed. &#x200B; Edit: I am Indian so I understand offshore culture really well. How do you make wise decisions in investing, start-up and such? What if you have little to no money? Is taking the risks of loans worth it? Hi roger, im waiting for the response for my question: Are you gona invest only in IT sector or any plans towards pharma as well Hey Brendan, Trust you are doing well! We are an early stage auto tech startup that aims to create a smart hyperlocal ecosystem of auto service/repair industry that offers vehicular assistances to the customers. Can you help us in our journey? Aadit + KV at zepto were unreal. Our fund wasn't up by my coGP was the first check and they were unreal to watch build... Fastest Founders EVER It's India's time... the country is about to blossom Would love to see pic of the tatto. We stay lean but we are launching some very cool referal programs 😅I'm not an investor, just thought of this scenario, wanted to know if u would pit startups against one another , jk 😁 Hi roger, How are you do you invest only in IT sector or interested in pharma sector as well? which opportunity do you see in Biotech? What would you say are the top 3 skills every person should invest in and learn ? Thank you Hey Brendon I hope you are doing well 1) How did you reached out to the startups (or how did they reached out to you) ? 2) I know 3 years isn't that much time to expect big returns but still what was the max return you got from any of those 40+ startups ? Yeah, they are my favorite founders too! Crazy fast execution! 🚀 How has your experience been with lawyers in India? How accessible were lawyers when you were looking out for one? How did you end up choosing one? Founders who go to a prestigious will have the ability to get more initial conversations, however this does NOT determine's a startup/founder success. I went to a mid-level college and did not have the typical founder background but I learned what my skills and gifts were and went really hard at getting in the right circles. My advice is drop your ego get shameless and do whatever it takes to get in the room. Haha What role does currency exchange rate play in VC investing in foreign countries like India? Is it common practice to hedge against depreciation? What do you think of the \" extreme cash burn, growth at any cost\" method of operations that are quite common these days. I'll send a follow request with what I plan to do on LinkedIn. Let's talk. Sneak peak - it might be in the energy sector 1) which Indian founder is your favourite? 2) on which Indian startup you are most bullish? 3) which problem isn't addressed/not sufficiently solved by Indian startups? 4) what is the mistake of Indian startups from high cash burn? 5) which type of Indian startup do you want to emerge from? 6) which is your favourite sector for investment? 7) what is your favourite Indian startup? 8) what is your advice for an Indian startup? >Hey Brendan, been hearing that the landscape of micro-investing in India is looking bright over the next decade. Any apps here you recommend that may be in your portfolio? check Spare8! Is it sound good if any venture is focusing on providing a good chunk of profit to charity and consumers instead of running after the valuation of billions of dollars? What do you think about AI and how will it affect the Indian economy going forward? Hi! Have you formulated a thesis for your India strategy or is it still a WIP? What are the options for entrepreneurs of Indian origin (but not Indian citizens anymore) to build startups in the Canada-India corridor? Thanks and all the best. Brendan, we invite you to Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. The Gujarati community is the business community. hope you will have a great time with the Gujarati founders. Hi Brendan, I am 15 years old and I want to open up my own aerospace company in the future. Are there any tips you can give to help me? BCI isn't biotech, it is neurotech :) How was managing Leicester City like? Terrible that's why I want to move to Mumbai City FC. :). Hello Brandon, I have recently launched a brand of apple juice. Basically I'm from Kashmir and we a have one of the largest production of apples here. We make our apple juice from the same process as US Martinellis. It's not made from concentrates and we don't use any preservatives or any additives and we get an amazing shelf life of 18 month. We showcased our product at the 2023 food fest in Delhi and received an overwhelming response as it tastes different from other apple juice in market. We are in process to send it to 11 indian states. While Martinellis is only available in North America and Europe, there is a huge market gap for our product in Gulf countries, South Asia, China and South East Asia. I believe our apple juice has the potential to become a household name in these regions. If you're interested, I can send you some samples for you to try. I would love your help in expanding our product in these markets. Hey Brendan, how do i reach out to you? I’m 17, and have a startup pitch, and an mvp ready! (It’s a medtech startup) Hi, Brendan. Does Indian Government makes things easy for all these or just a pain in the a**? How easy is it to run a business in India? Is it easier than Europe and America? Des ball clear rn What’s your favorite biryani? (There’s only one right answer) Thanks! you can reach out pitchto2amvc. Congrats on your starting your journey at 17 with startups! Hey Brendan, if one has an innovative/breakthrough idea, how to go along with it/move forward with it? The potential of VR is huge... I just get motion sickness when I use current headsets :( so I haven't been able to personally experience the magic. Could you share your thesis on VR and India? We haven't made a VR investment in India yet but my coGP has invested in all kinds of AR and Gaming startups in the US - Rosebud.ai , [Highrise.game](https://Highrise.game), [Muse.Place](https://Muse.Place) Kindly let us know in the r/pitchto2amvc page who we should look at How is one supposed to end up working in a venture capital firm? What skills does one need to develop and what steps should one take to land an interview in a VC Firm? What size pre-money values do you invest in typically? Hello Brendan! I'm planning to pursue consulting as a career and currently I'm studying management. Would like to know some insights from you on the following: Do you see any further growth potential for social entrepreneurship business ventures in India? Have you invested in any such ventures? Also what are the most common pain points you've observed in the operations of start ups that you've invested in? ask yourself - do people want this... does this solve a real problem? Start talking to people about your idea and refine it into a viable business and then just start executing on your dream. What are your views on Indian edtech startups that are highly valued but still loss making and very few of them are going to sustain in the long run. Chickens from Hyderabad hard everywhere... every day is a battle for business owners. So entrepreneurs must fight every day or they will die. Pain in the A\\*\\* but honestly RBI and SEBI are such good gov agencies - SVB situation would not have happened in India. India's gov stack with fintech is so good. UPI has changed the country and they've made the transaction free! Love them, Hate them, it's impressive Thanks for the reply. What comes first though? Starting the journey or to wait until i can get investors? If it's a large scale plan which requires quite a bit of investment, then do i need to have my own investment before approaching other investors? Hey Brenden Not real an invested question but how would you describe your experience in India? And if you had to describe India in one word than what would that be? Hi Brendon, Would you prefer managing liverpool again? India is MAGICAL. I taste, touch, hear, eat, and smell truly alien \"to me\" things all day every day. It is an assault on all 5 of my senses. But when you learn to navigate India - you can navigate anywhere. India forces you to be resilient and forward-moving. Indian people are unstoppable and I am so happy to see the country change in front of my eyes. In one word - India is..... drumroll..... **INDIA -** there is no word to capture its essence. It just is. It existed before us and will exist after us. Hey Brendan, can you just give Youri Tielemans a quick call and tell him to join Mancester United once his contract at Leicester expires at the end of the season? Thanks And where next? Back to Scotland or maybe somewhere else in Europe? most startups even most we invest into will fail... but I'd rather fail than not try. We are very good at what we do, so we will make money - we are focused. Have no fear and solve problems 1)how you manage you mental health in tough times 2) Do you have emergency assets. If so how much 3)what you look into a startup before investing? arsenal BABY What do you look in founders apart from concept. Do you give priority to people from premium institutions. Thanks Brilliant - love you're doing an AMA and thanks for humouring me haha let's connect there... is it inappropriate to ask you for your LinkedIn profile publically? Hey, not really a question, but I have been experimenting with pFinTools.com and we have built two of India's first and only financial tools - practical dividend calendar and real cost of no cost emi calculator. I've been thinking of monetizing this pretty soon and I have a couple of ideas, apart from running ads on the website. Will an investor be willing to invest in something like this? Why or why not? (I guess that is a question but anyways) Hi Brendan! Considering the fact that you founded a successful pet based company and you look upon yourself as half human and half golden retriever, and seeing your love for dogs. 1. What are your thoughts on Indian pet industry and startups? 2. I’m building a startup and this is little early to submit a pitchdeck, what are the chances of getting a mentorship from you? Hi Brendan, thank you for your service! \\- What technology areas are you most excited about these days? \\- Compared to the US, are there any particular technology areas where you find India lagging significantly behind the US or vice versa? \\- What are your opinions of pursuing a PhD in STEM if one thinks of starting up maybe 5 years down the lane? The last I heard, India has a shortage of deep-tech and research based higher education can be helpful there, your thoughts? &#x200B; Thank you!!! Is my question was to early or wasn't important still waiting for reply I am going to give you an honest answer: When we consider someone's school history they are usually under the age of 24. We invested in many - IIT, BITS, NITS, Ivy League, VIT, Stanford, IIM alums However, just because someone goes to these top competitive institutions, it does not mean that they are automatically good founders. That being said, getting into IIT does mean that you can work hard and learn fast... which are great traits. After age 25 your experience in the real world > your college. Hershel and I didn't go to Harvard to Stanford either but we will be the best seed fund in India... let me ring ronaldo while i am at it Thanks for the answer >1)how you manage you mental health in tough times 2) Do you have emergency assets. If so how much 3)what you look into a startup before investing? mental health is a huge deal, I am hyper-competitive and there are so many ups and downs in startups that it can be overwhelming. Founders should try to remember that every day is going to be a battle. celebrate the small stuff. Make fun of your cofounders; love what you are doing... everything comes back to solving a problem! we invest in pre-seed, seed-stage startups. We invest in all industries.. but do not invest in things we do not understand. It happens more in deep tech and bio tech and web 3. Hey idk if its relevant but i feel like dropping out of college what do you feel about college dropouts Software is solving huge pain points for Indians in record time. India itself is aspirational and with a unified effort, they will become the 3rd super power sooner than later. Hii Brendan I am founder of FRESARY and we are currently delivery grocery at village levels and soon to start agrochemicals delivery directly at farms I hope you got my point Wait for your advice and inputs around this whole idea depends on why someone drops out.... I encouraged Hershel to write the first check-in Zepto and they were dropouts... but they were on a mission. We have quite a few drop outs in 2am VC as well. I dont think academia success = guaranteed business success My reason being it drains me emotionally and yk how indian education system sucks. Btw do you have any positions up for dropouts🐘🐘😄 Indian investors are not risk takers in my options vs US vc investors. One question that often pops up is has this idea been done before? For example in the US. Therefore copycats are the norm in India because India doesn't reward original ideas. Also they have a robust mechanism of colleges being breeding grounds for new tech Hi... Btenden I have a startup \"Agrahar HYDRO-TEC\" design & build of Hydroponic Grow System Kits for URBAN Gardens Would you be interested in startup funding? Would you like to live in the country in the near future? Not Brendan, but kinda. So what happens is the following in my experience. Once the deal documents are signed i.e sha spa etc the fund sets a date where they can get the right exchange rates locked in for investment. Due to uncertainty around exit they don't hedge till they are clear about the exit process. They don't hedge it in advance from my experience tough question... VC is guarded unfairly. it is what it is... If you are genuine and LOVE startups and connect with startups and connect them with customers then you will be ok. Shashank at [100x.vc](https://100x.vc) started as media and then loved startups so much that he ran an incubator and now he is a partner at 100x. Anyone can do anything if they want it bad enough. What do you think? you just have to start. Show demand show your ability to build and then when you believe bc you put in the hours and the vision is clear - than the investor money will come. yummy - send them to 100x vc office and next time i am in india i will get them a try woah!!! Love this!!! I would say do whatever it takes to get to where you need to be to make that real Jai Shree Krishna. I would love to come to Gujarat and eat all the Thepla... scary stuff... we might not be around in 5-10 years. nope... charity is charity and business is business. Business is built on transactions which is an exchange of money for goods or services. If the inherent value is not fairly exchanged then the transaction does not occur and the business will fail. Business is about providing value... Charity is about selfless giving... Exchange is better than giving Why do you repost the same content on LinkedIn over and over again? all good bro... some people think im johnny sins... i am in good company small towns are tough - but will look at tier 2 and 3 areas. Check out our company BizzTM [www.bizztm.com](https://www.bizztm.com) \\- they built out of western india and i am so proud of them today more than ever... but i love it... it's good to know that i have competition for my name Are u new in ama? What are your favorite books? Which city are you in? What does your sanskrit tattoo say? all by design... how do you think I am on this AMA? Also, I really do love India THAT much. I am dedicating the next 25 years of my life there and want to share India's potential with everyone who may not kno it. not at the moment. i will be emotionally draining... building a fund is not easy but it's so much fun the pet industry is growing FAST and pets are with the affluent demographic which makes it larger than people realize. for mentorship if you try to provide value to me and i see that - i will provide value right bakc I am a beginner.Pls give step by step plan to achieve big Siddharta I am digital every step of the journey is the journey keep going. startup only dies when founder gives up hmmm.... i dont know on advice - just network with everyone. IDK on the startup that wasnt a very good pitch work hard ; give first not my field of knowledge but ag tech is HOT HOT HOT any take on proptech in india ? any proptech company that you follow ? Square Yards and a few others... real estate is tough space in india - too regulated and i dont understand it no none really i used to play when i was a kid wassssup def going to Saudi with RONALDO!! hi first take me out for a drink haha well we are working on it and hopefully india will provide an impressive realestate market soon to the world, but as someone who is not much inti real estate, can i know how do you know square yards ? anything that got your attention? Yes indian investors are phenomenal... the culture of innovation is coming. currently, software can help solve a lot... next will be innovation... give India time... Patience and hard work. MLS it will! What do you love and hate the most about india? What are the sectors which offer the best opportunities in India in your view ? >part golden retriever Fair to say it's not the bald part. Just ribbing. Cheers! Thanks for dropping by. Can you give feedback on my YC application if possible? Just applied couple days ago and would want to know what you as a VC think about it. Also, what are you your thoughts on gaming in India? Especially real money gaming? With regulations clearing up are you bullish? Are you guys funding any startup with that provide clean toilets on highways near major cities (like the ones at 5 star hotels)? haha! i love being bald. I own it. You're being an awesome sport. Definitely like a golden retriever. I have a question for you. I'm a business student. I've always fancied myself leading a company (that's not mine) well rather than having a company of my own. Is this necessarily a bad thing? Is it just a mindset thing? Hi Brendan, thanks for the AMA. Is it possible to get funding only for an idea. If yes, do you know any such platforms? Thank you.Can you suggest some good books Do you have a roadmap towards promoting work life balance in the startups you invest in? Indian startups are notorious for overworking and underpaying :( Hey Brendan , How valuable would data banks be in the future given ai / ml ? How would data banks be valued ? Hi Brendan! What is your opinion about india's shark tank? **Hi Brendan! Do you think that the market in India would be inculcating new and useful ideas that may become unicorn while being more of problem-solving for the customers than being just profit-centric?** .....Do you need a Graphic Designer 🥲 Do you believe in ‘luck’ or is it just an excuse cuz people don’t believe in themselves enough and aren’t willing to work hard People do end up using “Luck” as an excuse for not working hard but at the same time we gotta acknowledge the importance of “Luck” too cause it does have a good impact. The concept is very well explained in the book “Outliers”. Like if we take the example of: Bill gates, he wouldn’t be here or could have achieved where he is right now if certain things didn’t lined up for him or if he was born in a poor family. Not taking any hard-work away from him, but we gotta acknowledge the importance of luck too. Like It turns out that University of Washington, conveniently was across the street from high school, had the next level computer he needed. There he met Paul Allen who became his partner 4 years later. No doubt that Gates had an extraordinary aptitude for programming and software development. However a few things did lined up for him. Hey man biriyani every week isn't very healthy but thanks for the AMA Thanks bro 🫂 I know it's can get to be a lot... because I also get north Indian dishes + biriyani... that's why I have to work out 2x a day...having a Guju cofounder isn't great for the belly Luck is very important, but some folks can make their own luck! Luck is very important in life. When I got an invite 2 weeks before the first 100x vc pitch day at IITB I was considering not going. By fate, i decided that day that i needed to go. I had never been to India and bought a plane ticket. I didn't have a visa or knew what a visa was. Because of that random feeling, I am not working in India for the next 25 years. depends I love all things entrepreneurship. We have had one port co do well on shark tank - Broomees :) not sure unfortunately, work-life balance is not a thing if a startup is doing well especially early days. It is what it is. depends on founder's background Mehta family was an investor in peebuddy - that solves a lot of restroom pain points for females i don't gamble (investing in startups gives enough anxiety, but i believe in personal freedom as long as risks are made clear. >Thanks for dropping by. Can you give feedback on my YC application if possible? Just applied couple days ago and would want to know what you as a VC think about it. sure connect with me on the r/pitch2amvc page Hey so I'm currently a law student, and I've started my own restaurant around 6 months ago in Delhi, while I am seeing some growth, I don't think I can sustain until I start earning a significant profit. Basically, how does one get an angel investor in the infant stages of development? Further how would I scale once I hit profit because I don't want to sell feanchises and want to keep my quality up similar to in n out in the USA. Love - food, people, founders, co-investors, culture, and music (DJ NYK baby) Hate - traffic and airport passport + boarding pass entry check point we haven't invested in a restaurant chain. But mehta's did WOW Momo which was a good one for them. No not really asking for investment, simply asking as to how one would go about looking for investment, like how would I get my idea and numbers across to angels. 1. Sanjay Mehta 2. My next investment 3. Upskilling low skill 4. The burn must lead to higher market share and dominance if it doesn't, it's not a good thing 5. Food, clothing, edu 6. Supply chain 7. the next one i invest in 8. This is your moment - dont be scare we did that... it doesnt work if you are missing projections woah i wish i knew you... words right out of my mouth tough but talented - lawyers are in the billable hour game - find someone you trust My top three CS Yoga English no yes profits arent important if market share is created by the projected Real Madrid >I really am in awe of your vision of investing in India and its startups. 🚀 thank you. We look at all things early stage -r/pitchto2amVC Are you interested in investing in Ev charging infrastructure ? Same exact thoughts lol Hi Brendan, which steps will you suggest for someone who wants to build a startup in India. Thanks. I'll send you a pack of 24. I'm sure you will love it's taste. Hopefully you will be in India soon. I am really excited about this No one Up/Down votes it. 69 is the number!! Hey do you ever consider investing in asset heavy companies? What was the best place you visited here? Exchange is not better than giving where more than 40% of wealth is in the hands of the top 1% of people. By charity, I meant providing a source of education or providing medical facilities to them. At least its a better thing to do rather than rsising funds and take profitable exits and making money by fooling vc’s thx a lot the 3rd wave at HSR Thank you for your answers :) Biriyani and Gulab Jamun tough to force relationships...work hard and maintain your genuiness rarely but never say never Identify and solve 1 problem. yes i am investor in battery pool Currently building a resale platform, what do you think is the best strategy to gain traction? Also, what would be the optimal stage to raise funding? raise money when you feel that it will move a needle for traction not for hiring or building -- start by doing transactions manually talk to your family, listen to your gut. Live with no regrets. the intensity r/PitchTo2amVC I completely agree with this take, that’s our strategy for now. We’re looking to launch in the next 2 months and should probably be fine going the bootstrapped route. In case we see a huge potential for growth that is proportional to an investment, what is the best way to reach out to you guys apart from emailing you? Dont care if it’s a rejection, would appreciate some feedback. r/PitchTo2amVC If you do, what sort of an industry/sector would you look at. Like tech/non tech/core/trad/RE etc.? startups only I’m glad you responded. Thank you so much. To discuss further, when it comes to mentorship and providing the right value to you, I’ll make sure to put my best on table that I can. What would be the best way we can take this forward? But like startup’s in what sector? Hello Brendan, Thanks for arranging this AMA. 1. What was your experience building Wag! and what all issues did you deal with in this industry ? 2. Looking at you as a VC now, what was your experience when you raised funds for Wag? 3. How actively do you participate in making decisions and helping the founders you invest in? we've done companies in Goa, Rajasthan, Ranchi, Kolkata... there are advantages and disadvantages - founder should decide what is better 1. WAG! was an awesome journey. We started with nothing but air mattresses and an idea. I walked the dogs myself bc we if we were short walkers until we understood the market better. We raised $350M from top VC's. We were battered in the press for various reasons... some BS some true. I wouldn't trade it for anything. 2. Raising is hard, but we believed in ourself so it happens. 3. We help but we don't micro-manage. the founder has to be a leader i am an advisor YC is great. They will go down as the best early-stage investor of all time. Paul Graham and Sam Altman and Michael Siebel are excellent leaders... Garry is wonderful. They are startup gurus. However, they are a business like everyone else... nothing is guaranteed. Why do people think I look like Jonny Sins? agnostic - mostly software none of it really matters unless you have a burning desire to solve a particular problem already in motion. Also in this market, i would speak with everyone. First time founders aren't allowed to say no to meetings from any known investors Ahh nice nice anything but AI - I mean it's soooo overplayed right. I am big on crypto and the Metaverse farm games. In India they need to focus on space tech only - let's get to Neptune I'd study anthropology lol i am excited about healthcare and upskilling deep tech, space tech, and food tech - India is ahead in with unified payments and the health initiative is badass. PHD is very long... I like to build but to each their own BITS or IIT What's the hot college of the month? what do you like Reddit is the best... Thoughts on getting sacked from Leicester? Do you think the owners gave you sufficient backing and quality players in the past few years? whether it's bad or good is only up to you.. no one else's opinion should matter. That's incredible!! I'm going to read them!! Actually, one of my relatives wants to start a business, and he's focusing on a small town. What do you think of his chances of success? another good one: we have GMV of $3M and are growing 100% every month Take rate? \\-10% we give deep discount for customer on first purchase. ![gif](giphy|26gR0Eq80PVCr1MHK|downsized) it was awful. I am so sad... Now I gotta go MLS route. depends on a lot of factors... but if entrepreneur works hard then they tend to do ok in anything. SMB is not rocket science A brief description about the town: The population is in the range of 200-300k, and there is a good connectivity and an old, well-known temple, making it somewhat of a tourist destination. Overall a nice place for a new start!! What kind of a sector he might choose?? I mean what would be your recommendation?? Hey Brendan, thoughts on union busting? Hi Brendan, As a founder, I am excited to introduce you to our innovative startup, Prayaan Media. Our mission is to revolutionize the in-auto entertainment and advertising industry in India, which we believe is a major problem in the country. We have identified that only 1% of the 150,000 auto-rickshaws in Hyderabad have pre-built speakers, and those that do often play music that is too loud or inappropriate for passengers. We aim to solve this problem by installing high-quality Bluetooth speakers in every auto-rickshaw and providing drivers with a playlist curated by our team. This will enhance the in-auto experience for passengers and create a new source of income for drivers. Our solution not only addresses the problem of low-quality in-auto entertainment but also creates a cost-effective and efficient advertising platform for businesses. Advertisers can purchase promotional slots within the playlist to reach their target audience in a cost-effective manner. Passengers can enjoy a better in-auto experience, and drivers will receive a fixed amount per hour for playing the playlist. It is a win-win situation for everyone involved. We have already launched our MVP and have on-boarded 10 autos with an average of 5 hours of playtime per day. In the last month alone, we paid out Rs.1600 to our drivers. We have also approached 100+ advertisers, out of which 10 have shown interest, and 2 have already given their ads in our startup. Our revenue projections show that we have the potential to capture a significant market share in the Indian advertising industry, which is currently worth approximately $15 billion. We plan to leverage social media channels to increase brand awareness and reach potential customers, partner with popular music streaming services to create curated playlists, and offer referral bonuses for both advertisers and drivers to increase adoption. As a founder, I am confident that Prayaan Media has the potential to make a significant impact in the in-auto entertainment and advertising industry in India. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to hearing from you soon. If you have any questions or would like to know more about our startup, please don't hesitate to contact me at [**anil.02missile@gmail.com**](mailto:anil.02missile@gmail.com). Personally I’m a huge fan of heavy industries, I do have a family background in it, so oil and gas, metals, mining, ports/logistics, power, etc. are things right up my alley My mum actually heads a VC fund and was telling how VCs generally fund only asset light businesses, so I was j curious if that was the case here as well. no thoughts... Looking for work Brendan. I'm unemployed. Can ya pls help me? yes it's mostly the case at least for us and our coinvestors. what's your skill sets - i love recruiting Makes sense considering that at most Indian companies love defaulting on loans, especially the big corporates What do you hate about India and think usa does better? Apologies if I wasn't clear. I was asking about your POV on the RMG industry and its future potential. Not if you personally played real money skill games. Brendan, since you write about the growth story of India - Do you think we messed up by moving from an agricultural country and jumped to a services country and completely skipped manufacturing? What can be done to course correct and would you invest in a B2B manufacturing company that's digitizing the industry? Right, but most startups don’t even follow Indian law. They don’t pay overtime either. Hi Brendan - I've actually invested in BizzTM through LetsVenture. Remember Anupam Mittal being one of the backers. How are they doing? Don't receive any updates/MIS from them. What should a aerospace manufacturing startup do to get funding? It’s capital intense, slow and boring, less VCs and trust issues from prospective clients because everyone thinks aerospace is difficult. Which it is, BUT there’s a big market requirement. BTW- we have the prototypes tested and ready for scaling. People just won’t believe us without a big brand buddy alongside. If any of your startups need branding, I can be of help ; ). and sorry for pitching like this 🙏🏻 Hey I’d also like to try some, can you give me some more info? Does the Adani scam/grift change the perception of India as an investment destination in the minds of foreign investors like you? Hii I m 20 ys old now n confused between so many things like I m currently pursuing b.com n company secretary course. and also loves to participate in other events but the time management is a lot and also interested in learning many more things like stock market etc.. but don't know should wait or just focus on one of now or I m going good?"
