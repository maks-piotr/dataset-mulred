They failed to communicate it properly to the farmers also. Some mallicious forces from Punjab and Haryana utilized farmers unions to choke up Delhi long enough (and that US-capitol-like humiliation on the red fort) to force the government to repeal the laws. I consider it one of the biggest losses of India in the past decade (right beside the overwhelming increase in communal hate online). \n\n**My questions**: (1) I don't think any government will touch this topic for the next 15-20 years. Will India be better without these farm laws than it would have been with these farm laws? (2) If you are against these laws, what changes would you like to have in them? (3) Is there anyone who believes that the current farming laws and APMC centric infrastructure is the best for India? Why?\n\n\\[1\\] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021\\_Indian\\_farmers%27\\_protest#Academics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers%27_protest#Academics)",

        "better do what the RSS's farmer groups wanted - bring in the farm laws and 1 more - that even private parties must buy it over MSP.",
        "I was aginst farm laws. Changes i wanted - Msp so that no private company can harass farmers, give right of moving to court to farmers which were not in these laws. These were also the major demands of protesting farmers. And fuck those who think Farmer protest in anyway anti national or by malicious forcesðŸ¤¬",
        "We need reform in the agriculture industry. \n\nBut Modi government doesnt seem to have taken the needs of farmers into account when making these laws. Also, during the protest they were inflexible and chose to break rather than bend. \n\nThis is a major failure and yes, no reform may come for another 15-20 yeats. \n\nAPMCs are corrupt, but are logically sound. Rather than reform them, government should empower farmers and provide more support in selling agricultural produce so that APMCs can not exploit them.",
        "Your topic should have been - how could the government avoided this situation. They could have had rounds of consultation and consensus building - instead coming in the morning and saying aaj ka taja law is - Farm laws. and since I have majority - I give a damn about what anyone else thinks.",
        "> malicious forces from Punjab and Haryana \n\nThe three farm laws were pushed by the corporates to privatize agriculture and exploit the farmers. We fought against these laws for over a year. Protests took place all across India. I had organized numerous large-scale protests in Bihar. Over 800 farmers died in the struggle. Most of the farmer unions opposed the law. Agriculture experts like Devinder Sharma and P Sainath opposed the law. Economists opposed the law. Lawyers opposed the law. And here a bunch of ignorant morons are calling us malicious.",

        "When petrol and diesel prices were disconnected from subsidy, we were told public will get benefits i.e. when prices fall, we will get the benefit. Are you getting the benefit? May be if you are rich enough to invest into oil companies but as small consumers on limited budget you are not. \n\nWhy do you believe that IMF and Gita Gopinath have the interest of small customers in mind instead of large corps?",
        "MSP & Free market cant exist together. Either the goverment buys all produce at MSP, or the free market buys at market price.\n\nIf the goverment sets a MSP and there is a low output, the prices would suddenly shoot up. The free market would not like these prices and would much rather just buy it from the goverment/APMC. Where there is a surplus, the goverment would be paying tax money to buy stock and then sell it at a loss to the market.",
        "Peddling corporate agenda in the name of farm laws. Only law that is necessary is to pay a fair price to farmers so they can earn decent living wages. But crooks corporates would rather pick farm produce at as little price as possible to fulfill their own coffers.\n\nAnd then we have idiots peddling this same agenda without realizing that it is hitting their own pockets as well.",
        "yeah. Either way, the farmers benefit. Dont see whats wrong in that",

        "90% of Indian farmers are marginal farmers. I.E. their land holding is too small (less than 2 acres equivalent). For such small farm size, the only ways to give them a decent living wage (equal to national average 172k per year per person in family of 4 = 6.9Lpa) are \n\nA) farm prices to increase by 11X (2.5 acres is avg farm size ). That means food as % of income has to become 20% of average salary (even higher than most expensive developed country)\n\nB)Or other part of population has to subsidise 60% of population in farming. \n\nWhich option do you recommend?",
        "Just do something so they arent left to commit suicides. Is it too much to ask for?",
        "Now you have asked for a fair goal. \n\nBut the path to that goal starts with an acknowledgment that marginal farming is not a sustainable enterprise. Till this truth is not said out loud, people will romanticise the misery. \n\nSince marginal farming does not meet family needs, over time it eventually leads to debt trap. And that leads to desperate situation. \n\nSolution is as follows \n- China method: Accelerate transition of marginal farmers into manufacturing and service sector. Itâ€™s side effect will be accelerate urbanisation. Less than 5% of population should be employed in farming\n- Deregulate farm produce market. APMC are a textbook solution that does not work in practical world. Example: fruits and vegetables are outside APMC framework but work much better for farmers. \n- Let food prices rise: it is not farmerâ€™s burden to feed the urban poor by sacrificing their own family. \n\nAll tough choices that are difficult to explain in simple slogans.",
        "But if you leave it in the hands of a few corporates, there will be NO solution.\n\nAPMCs have been systematically killed and made defunct across the board. The solution could be to fix corrupt practices there and let everyone receive their fair share. \n\nAnd the last solution suggested, food prices are already rising with absolutely zero gain for the farming community.
