They‚Äôre more like flimsy wallets than cases. Just the tiniest pinch, and my specs are damaged. What are they thinking? It‚Äôs like they designed it specifically to make you need another order sooner.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt even get me started on their \"Owndays\" line, which they‚Äôre hyping up as some premium Japanese brand. Turns out, it‚Äôs basically just a rebadged version of John Jacobs. I mean, what kind of rebranding nonsense is that? I recently placed three orders, and I‚Äôve had to return every single one of them.\n\nI‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm never going to order from Lenskart again\n\n",

        "Lenskart is one of the shittiest companies out there that gets away with a lot of shady stuff. Once you see past the facade, it's all a huge pile of shit. Here's to name a few:\n\n1. The other day I wanted to get myself a new pair of glasses so I installed the app. As soon as I opened the app, it showed me a  full screen ad to buy lenskart gold for 500 rupees. It said that on purchase of lenskart premium, I'll be entitled to 4 benefits, with free quarterly repairs and maintenance being one of them. I remembered that I had a coupon for a 1 year gold membership. The moment I entered the coupon code and got the membership for free, guess what? I now get only three benefits. No more free quarterly maintenance and repairs. And honestly, without it, it's not even worth it to get a gold membership. To add insult to injury, among the list of charges is a 49 rupees delivery fee. A 49 rupees delivery fee to deliver a confirmation email to my mail. I mean wtf!\n\n2. The gold membership itself is a scam. There's no such thing as a buy one get one free. Search for a product on lenskart, find it's product code and search for the same product on Amazon using the code. You'll get it at half the price on amazon (sometimes even less than half). The fucking audacity to charge the customer I'm order to sell him more stuff!\n\n3. The only other benefit you get with gold is free eye checkup at stores or in home. And honestly, how many times would you get your eyesight checked in a year for the 500 rupees membership to make sense?\n\nAt this point, the only reason why people aren't questioning this is because most of us get free gold memberships through coupons. But that doesn't mean everyone gets a free membership coupon. Even if 1 percent of lenskart's gold members pay for the membership, it's still a huge sum of money.",
        "What's a good eyewear brand then? I have always used lenskart but they seem to not last more thana year. Since i anyway change frames frequently i didn't mind.",
        "Idk if you have ever bought from local eyewear places, but I saw your last line that you had to return them. Guess what? The local places never allowed return. And often what you got might be flimsy quality.",
        "Try titan eye.",
        "Titan Eye Plus is good.",
        "Yes.\nThey have variety and even branded glasses.",
        "I have John & Jacobs glasses. Bought them from Lenskart. The frame, glasses are yellowed after 1 year of use.",
        "Strange. I bought two pairs from them in 2022. They‚Äôve both held up very nicely. One of them I wear every day for several hours a day.",
        "All these franchisee businesses sell low quality products for high markups i.e. Lenskart, Titan Eye, Cleardekho etc. These companies sells disposable grade products, and eyewear isn't a disposable item. If you want to get actual good quality products. You need to visit good opticians, and buy quality products from eyewear brands that actively work on improving vision. Also, always invest in a good pair of lenses over frames. If you need any assistance, feel free to get back.",
        "Anything you see on Lenskart has zero credibility as they're all made-up names, mass produced in China. Ownsday, John Jacobs, etc. None of them are \"real\" brands. It's all made-up by Lenskart themselves, and create a sense of choices for their customers. But, it means nothing. At the end of the day, they're all low quality disposal grade products.",
        "Titan is much better",
        "Who uses Lenskart? Normal footpath shops are a better place for glasses than Lenskart.\n\nTaitan is the minimum you should go for if you value your eyes.",
        "Downhill? Well, when was it uphill for that matter? Third grade frame and lenses from China, and discount laden strategy???",
        "I bought Lenskart glasses two years back and bought one for my mom one year back.\n\nBoth of us got our eyes weaker and started to have issues with the lens.\n\nWe later switched back to our nearest local optical shop and literally both of us are now in our comfort zone.\n\nI got same feedback from my friends who warned me not to buy from them",
        ">find it's product code and search for the same product on Amazon using the code.\n\nI don't think that is possible.",
        "I had got a glass and frame in 2017 and its still as good as it was thay day. Only I had to replace the box as it was broken bcz I sat on that accidently.\n\nIf this is the situation now what you are showing, It surely is freefall.",
        "First and last time customer of Lenskart. Both pair lasted about a year and half. The frame broke while in my face. ü§î It was possibly brought for a dollar in China. \n\nGot a replacement from the dollar store in Canada for 3 CAD. (159 Rupees) It has lasted me 2 years! And ongoing.",
        "Lenskart was always mediocre.",
        "In Singapore, I have known (not used ) Owndays as a budget brand that had online and brick and mortar shops. Considering the extremely high markup in eyewear industry the budget brands are welcome. \n\nI looked up and saw that Owndays has been acquired by Lenskart.\n\nAbout 7-8 years ago I had ordered quite a few eye glasses from Lenskart. All of them broke with a few months ...to maybe a year or a bit more. One power sunglass broke within 4 months of use, right there on my face. The typical failure profile was a clean break across the rim of one of the lenses.\n\nSince then I have steered clear of Lenskart. Their main business model is to increase their top line by forcing you to buy 2. It's a good model if you consider the large demographic to whom fashion matters and you have two pairs instead of one. Also many people prefer to have a spare, just in case. The only and biggest problem is that startups like these are mostly on expansion spree and don't care about the shit quality. Membership is another trap. Advertising and TV programs help their marketing. It is a fallacy to think that an economically successful companies will always providing the best price or the highest quality for the consumer. It is possible to provide much better quality at the prices they charge. They just won't.",

        "I‚Äôm not sure if it was just a one-time issue, but the frame I got from Titan had problems back in 2017. I had to visit the store multiple times, though the service was great. Eventually, I tried Lenskart, which offered a BOGO deal and had good frames at the time. Now, I might consider switching back to Titan Eye Plus.",
        "Piyush Bansal seems to be using every possible tactic to boost sales and revenue, and it appears the company can get away with it due to limited alternatives. In India, with a steady stream of first-time buyers, the company could continue for years without reconsidering its approach.",
        "Totally agreed. I believe lack of alternatives at such price points is the key for its survival till now.",
        "Hey, even Toyota gives you better service when they slap their badge on a Maruti! But with Lenskart? Nope‚Äîstill the same old lousy service, just with extra ‚Äúflair.‚Äù",
        "Stopped buying from them 10 years ago. Always prefer Titan eye or gkb optical",
        "Luxotica.",
        "True. My parents got specs made from local shops.\n\nThe ones I returned costed 7.2k for 2 frame + basic lens + photochromatic coating. \nI don't know if the prices are justified considering the low quality of lens, frames and coating. I expect better from a company that is valued in billions. \n\nOnly the lack of alternatives and study first time buyers is keeping the show going for lenskart.",
        "I have got specs done from Titan eye plus, vision express before in 2015 to 2017. Lenskart then had better quality than now. Bought into BOGO sales. Lenskart made us change specs more often from these sales.",
        "Lenskart seems eager for us to order constantly‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs because the specs don‚Äôt last or thanks to their BOGO (or should I say, ‚Äúbogus‚Äù) sales!",
        "I can second that. I also got specs in 2017 from Lenskart. Used them for 3 years, had to change because of change in power. \n\nFrom then on never really got the same quality. Frames/lens break within a year. Their moto has become to make us order more and often by giving shitty quality with BOGO and discount sale.",
        "You can't buy powered stuff on Amazon. If you just need regular sunglasses you can buy from literally anywhere",
        "I have been using Lenskart pretty much since 2013-14. I have never faced issues regarding bad quality, all my glasses last for many years. I change only when there is some paint chip off etc. They are far better than local stores. Titan etc is better quality but much costlier.",
        "I somewhat agree with you. It is one of the factors. Quality optical lenses used to be expensive, but that's not the case anymore. Now, brands have introduced many budget-friendly options without compromising on quality. Also, the lack of knowledge, and awareness among the customers is another reason. I don't blame them though. It's an optician's responsibility to guide its customers properly, but most of the optical stores lack knowledge themselves. People also tend to treat a lens as just a lens. But, that is not the case. A LOT of tech and R&D goes into manufacturing quality lenses. It's actually amazing how your vision can differ because of the lens, and the way it is mapped despite of the having the same prescription.",
        "Yes, unfortunately.",
        "Go for titan, they dont even charge for cleaning (even after the warranty goes off),knowledgeable staff. Con- quite expensive",
        "If possible opt for store pickup. You can check your pair before leaving",
        "Tital eye plus is way better, i do feel like options are limited sometimes but whatever they have is absolutely top notch quality.",
        "Its like boat. Made in China, labelled in India. But in the case of glasses chinese made ones are still a better alternative than Luxotica monopoly,*as long as they* are priced right, which lenskart absolutely doesn't.",
        "it might be for people like me who have to wear glasses every second of the day except sleeping. My frames dont last more than 1 and half year.",
        "Ther is an actual japanese brand owndays which i guess sold trademark to lenskart.\n\nTheir specs used to be awesome. Especially the lens and would prepare the specs in 20 minutes.\n\nI still am using my owndays specs after 5 years I guess.",
        "Now it's majorly owned by lenskart and you know what happens when lenskart is calling shots. Twice, lens were cracked out of the box. They are just rebadging John Jacobs designs. Nothing Japanese about it anymore.",
        "I assume it's due to poor quality coating of lens.",
        "It was bad since the begining",
        "dont know man may this is a rare issue i have around 5-7 glasses from lenskart all have best cases. one time i even got refund of the total amount as they did not deliver in time. I even get my specs cleaned using some machine for free. \n\nI do agree that their pricing has become worse these days.",
        "After my first purchase from them five years ago, I decided I will only resort to local vendors for selecting my spectacles. VFM products and I can try them out physically.",
        "From 2017 I have ordered atleast 3 times for myself and more than 5 times for others. Never has the  quality and service been so low.",
        "Never ordered from local shops for myself. How much does it cost for <2 power, photochromatic coating and a decent frame? Thinking for going local for my next purchase.",
        "Not so bad at first. They did relieve us from come tomorrow attitude.",
        "It depends from vendor to vendor. I'm unable to comment how much will it cost, but give it a shot! I'm pretty sure you won't regret it.",
        "try complaining to lenskart via mail. May be they can compensate and resolve the issue and other dont get this bad quality.",
        "I meant the price for quality. I found it too expensive.",
        "I already did that. For the case they said, for John Jacobs and Owndays hard case has been replaced with soft case for convenience of carrying around. It seems lenskart values convenience of carrying around over safety for such a fragile thing. Damn. \n\nAs for the quality they said you can return within 14 days. Classic.",
        "True. It seems lens only costs about 50 bucks to make. Hence they allow you to return even if it's custom made. They will just discard it.",
        "I agree"

Go for titan, they dont even charge for cleaning (even after the warranty goes off),knowledgeable staff. Con- quite expensive If possible opt for store pickup. You can check your pair before leaving Tital eye plus is way better, i do feel like options are limited sometimes but whatever they have is absolutely top notch quality. Its like boat. Made in China, labelled in India. But in the case of glasses chinese made ones are still a better alternative than Luxotica monopoly,*as long as they* are priced right, which lenskart absolutely doesn't. it might be for people like me who have to wear glasses every second of the day except sleeping. My frames dont last more than 1 and half year. Ther is an actual japanese brand owndays which i guess sold trademark to lenskart. Their specs used to be awesome. Especially the lens and would prepare the specs in 20 minutes. I still am using my owndays specs after 5 years I guess. Now it's majorly owned by lenskart and you know what happens when lenskart is calling shots. Twice, lens were cracked out of the box. They are just rebadging John Jacobs designs. Nothing Japanese about it anymore. I assume it's due to poor quality coating of lens. It was bad since the begining dont know man may this is a rare issue i have around 5-7 glasses from lenskart all have best cases. one time i even got refund of the total amount as they did not deliver in time. I even get my specs cleaned using some machine for free. I do agree that their pricing has become worse these days. After my first purchase from them five years ago, I decided I will only resort to local vendors for selecting my spectacles. VFM products and I can try them out physically. From 2017 I have ordered atleast 3 times for myself and more than 5 times for others. Never has the quality and service been so low. Never ordered from local shops for myself. How much does it cost for <2 power, photochromatic coating and a decent frame? Thinking for going local for my next purchase. Not so bad at first. They did relieve us from come tomorrow attitude. It depends from vendor to vendor. I'm unable to comment how much will it cost, but give it a shot! I'm pretty sure you won't regret it. try complaining to lenskart via mail. May be they can compensate and resolve the issue and other dont get this bad quality. I meant the price for quality. I found it too expensive. I already did that. For the case they said, for John Jacobs and Owndays hard case has been replaced with soft case for convenience of carrying around. It seems lenskart values convenience of carrying around over safety for such a fragile thing. Damn. As for the quality they said you can return within 14 days. Classic. True. It seems lens only costs about 50 bucks to make. Hence they allow you to return even if it's custom made. They will just discard it. I agree"
