    "selftext": "**Good morning, everyone!**\n\n**IMF Distances Itself from India's Growth Projection**\n\nToday's news sheds light on the recent divergence between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Krishnamurthy Subramanian, an executive director at the IMF, regarding India's growth projection. Here's a closer look:\n\n**1. IMF's Clarification:** The IMF made it clear that the 8% growth projection attributed to Subramanian does not represent their official stance on India's economic growth.\n\n**2. Subramanian's Assertion:** Krishnamurthy Subramanian, India's representative at the IMF, put forward a bold projection of 8% growth for India's economy, diverging from the IMF's estimates.\n\n**3. IMF's Growth Estimate:** Contrary to Subramanian's projection, the IMF anticipates India's GDP to expand by 6.7% in the fiscal year 2023â€“24, reflecting a more conservative outlook.\n\n**4. Official IMF View:** The IMF reiterated that Subramanian's growth figures do not align with their official views and forecasts for India's economic performance.\n\n**5. Subramanian's Response:** In response to IMF's statement, Subramanian defended his projection, citing past inaccuracies in IMF's economists' estimates regarding India's growth trajectory.\n\nSource- [https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/imf-clarifies-krishnamurthy-subramanian-statement-about-india-growth-projections-2523822-2024-04-05](https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/imf-clarifies-krishnamurthy-subramanian-statement-about-india-growth-projections-2523822-2024-04-05)",
