One part of me wants to stay here, pursue ceramics with my full time job and commit to living in this city and another part of me wants to go abroad to pursue the MBA and settle there. \n\nNot looking at public policy or similar course because it would box me in this sector that I'm getting very tired and disillusioned with. I thought MBA would be a good and comfortable out for me and I'm confident of securing admission in a decent school. My wavering commitment is however delaying the process for me. Is there a way I can directly apply for a job in Europe in Government related sectors for now and pursue my creative dreams on the side from there?"
