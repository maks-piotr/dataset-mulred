    "selftext": "I ordered Puma RSZ shoes from Flipkart 20 days ago. It was selling at a very discounted price i.e, 2770 and the seller was RetailNet who's a well known seller. So, when I opened the Package the shoe box was of puma but when opened the box there was a pair of cheap quality shoes which sells on roadside markets. I'm contacting Flipkart from 20 days and I talked to roughly 30 support executives. They told me to share the photos many times. They always accept my return request after that but the delivery executive never picks up the product and say to me that he can only picks up the product if it matches the ordered product. After he rejects the pickup I always got a message that my pickup is rejected because it was damaged. My pickup is rejected 5 times and everytime i have to repeat the process of contacting Flipkart customer support. I'm a premium plus member of Flipkart and have been shopping here from 10+ years and shopped for more than 10 lakhs. Is there anything I can do?",

Sorry u had to face this issue bro. I really like flipkart cuz I get the most bizzare pricing there as compared to amazon. Got 20 pairs of shoes thanks to flipkart and myntra. But with all these recent scams going on with flipkart, kinda losing trust. Also flipkart’s customer service is shit. I dont know why it even exists. Also they bought myntra so ig in a couple of months the same thing will start happening to myntra users as well.\n\nOut of topic question, i am also a Plus Premium member like you. Could you tell me how many supercoins u got for the shoe order. Cuz flipkart shows that if u are plus premium u get upto 300 supercoins.

        "With the upcoming sale, a PSA is important for everyone I think:\n\n1) ALWAYS make a video of your unboxings. And not with one hand opening the box and other holding the phone/camera.. place it somewhere or give the camera to a friend/family member to record.. There should be no cuts and the box should be visible at all times.\n\n2) If you're opting for open box delivery be 150% certain the product is perfectly fine. Do NOT compromise at all. If you feel even 0.1% doubt that there's something wrong with it, reject the order. Because once you accept an OTD delivery and then you discover an issue FK will fuck you six ways to Sundays. \n\n3) If you're exchanging an old mobile, again: RECORD the exchange.. and ask the delivery boy's name _on camera_. Trust me. When they know their name and face are on film their tendency to do bullshit reduces a LOT.\n\n4) Finally, do not buy something just because it's on sale, or it _looks_ to be under a discount. Use a price tracker app/website like Keepa to check a product's price history. Chances are the product was always available at the same price but just inflated to MRP 1-2 days before the sale then lowered again and being shown to you as a discount.",

That's when the company will actually back down and refund you, but it takes about 2 months and most people don't know how to write the Court complaint properly.",

        "Same thing happened to me on Amazon. I didn't do much.. don't make the same mistake..\n\nContact Flipkart. Explicitly explaining the issue. If the return isn't don't maybe file a consumer court complaint against Flipkart. (process is completely online)",
        "Never ever buy shoes online. Always try and buy. Most online shoes are fake.",
        "Still ordering from Flipkart, are we?\nLikes to live life dangerously, don’t we?",
        "I lost ₹3499/- from Flipkart. Never got back the amount.\n\nIt was for a graphic tablet. Had booked it for cash on delivery, but then i had an option to pay online through UPI before the delivery happens. So i did that. But when the delivery guy came he said that there's no payment done against my order. But when i told him that i have paid using GPay, he said that the payment will get refunded back to my account, so no worries. And i paid him during delivery. Again. \n\nNo amount was refunded. Contacted Flipkart, and they said they've refunded to my account, contacted the bank but they never got it.  It became a cycle of contacting both these parties for 3 months. Until i was fed up. Never used Flipkart again.",
        "I had been scammed once too my return order was also cancelled I called to an executive and gave him a piece of my mind",
        "Welcome to the club. File a chargeback through your credit/debit card if you can, because they haven't delivered the product.\n\nAlso start a case through consumer court.\n\nDon't trust Flipkart, they don't want to help you.",
        "Amazon pices are a bit higher, but I received correct product most of the time…and if not, they replace or refund without much hassle. Fuck flipkart, they act like they doing some charity when asked return or refund",
        "It's not Flipkart, it's the people who do this.",
        "I've worked at Amazon in a management role, while I'll agree to this but I think its obvious why they do this, most of the times the delivery operatives are the root cause, we wait clear the staff, recaliberate the modus operandi and restart the function.",

        "I had no budget restrictions.",
        "You bought from flipkart. Expect these.",
        "Well I mean it's believable, let's say you buy groceries they'll easily be 3-5k, add same random shit which you think you've always needed but you never use easily 500-1k, I for one have bought a lot of shoes online and buy a pair every alternate month 3-4k, add phones, earphones, random electronics add that it could easily go to 1.5L and I haven't added big ticket items like tv fridge etc.",
        "the audacity !",
        "If you are a supposed Flipkart dedicated buyer then I can't say, I feel sorry for you. It's been 5 years since Flipkart service quality has dropped down at the bottom.\n\nSTOP BUYING FROM THAT SHITTY SITE AND CRYING ABOUT IT ONLINE.\n\nI got scammed 5 years ago and I never purchased anything after that. I trust Amazon a lot more than Flipkart.",
        "Haa almost safe hota, agar scam nikla to delivery boy wapis lekar chala jata",
        "I bought one from Amazon a few years ago and it's been working absolutely fine.\n\nI still recorded the entire unboxing experience but there were no issues.\n\nMy advice is either get it via offline shops, where you may get a better deal since those shops are under a lot more pressure to make a sale because of online shopping... Or get it from Amazon.\n\nAvoid Flipkart if you can. Amazon isn't perfect either but their support is leagues better than Flipkart, that's for sure",
        "my reddit day is incomplete without the regular flipkart scam",
        "It is operating in India as before so tax is the same as before selling to Walmart. But the methods of doing business and all have been changed after selling to Walmart.",

        "It's obviously your fault. Why order from Flipkart when everyone knows that it's always a scam.",
        "Ok I'm gonna do this",
        "It's just an empty sub, not a scam. Idk why people say scam to mean they're disappointed.",
        "Open box option was not there",
        "Bro I'm not active here😞",
        "I'm also losing hope",
        "Can I file chargeback on an upi transaction?",
        "Are you a Flipkart employee?",
        "I think it's a collaboration of nike with a drone company 😢",
        "No. File a case with consumer court.\n\nAlso it seems Puma has it's own website where it sells and ships stuff. Many brands like Samsung, Agaro etc. have their own websites. Seems better than going through Amazon and Flipkart.",
        "This has been happening for quite some time and the likelihood of such events will increase even more. I myself experienced it once. Customer support will keep on delaying it inordinately as it involves no amount of profit to the company.\n\nThis is the reason I always say there needs to be a well-defined law ordering delivery companies to make open order deliveries, wherein a customer may open and verify the authenticity of the package at the time of delivery. If unsatisfied, the customer may cancel the order right away and hand over the package back to the delivery agent immediately. That'd save a lot of time and trouble for both ends. This should be made mandatory.",
        "No. Being in business teaches you to care for customers. Rarely, it happens that a company tends to be an asshole and mostly happens when they don't have competition in the market",
        "Sure",
        "10 lakh ka kya kharid liya hai flipkart se aaj tak be???\n\nAnyways, AIRDRON",
        "Been there",
        "OP is in an even worse situation.  Ordered puma received AIRDRON.",
        "Yes, stop shopping from Flipkart",
        "I'm not sure whether I would be upset",
        "Every time I have an issue with Flipkart and they take days to resolve it, I always resort to \"If this isn't resolved by tomorrow, I'll have no choice but to start using Amazon for all my purchases. I'm a longtime customer of Flipkart and I've never been so disappointed with your service\". It always works and I get a refund or replacement within the next few hours. I use Amazon a lot too but sometimes Flipkart has better deals for stuff like Dettol cleaning liquid, Godrej handwash, etc. But I don't tell them that and just give them an ultimatum and that lights a fire under their asses to make sure my issue is resolved. \n\nMost recent example was when I bought 2x handwash packs but got only one despite paying for both. Went back and forth for a week where they said they'd look into it until I gave them that ultimatum. \n\nAmazon, on the other hand, has been flawless.",
        "That's good to know. I remember reading that there are some pincodes in UP which are banned because there were a lot of cases of customer taking the order and beating up the delivery when he asked for payment",
        "Bhai mobile phones, ACs, fridge, washing machine and so on in the span of 9-10 years will add up to that amount",
        "Ohhh achha ha to thik hai. Me choti cheeze hi mangwata hu to relate nai kar paya achanak se.",
        "Dind a lawyer friend and send them a legal notice",
        "Well I'm from UP as well that was very rare and in these instances the products are insuredand the driver would've been paid for his losses after an investigation, what the issue we had to deal with a lot was customers exploiting return policies buying local electronics, shoes etc and trying to return them as original and get the refund. Thus we had to put this cross verification system in place, so to be really blunt if you don't check your product at the time of purchase don't expect the delivery operative to be the same.",
        "Completely agree. Which is why I tell everyone to make unboxing videos since even if the customer is saying the truth, the e-commerce has no idea without proof.",
        "well unboxing videos can be disputed as well, there are certain things you should keep in mind\n\n1) Shoot the package BEFORE you're opening it ensuring its not tampered with.\n2) Make no cuts in the video.\n3) If possible try to get it unboxed it infront of the delivery executive and shoot that aswell.\n4) Avoid buying electronics/ pc components/perfumes >5-10k on these website.",
        "That account ban is something Flipkart does too lol and at a much less offense too.\n\nAmazon's account banning for multiple returns are more robust  and has higher counts. That even gets reset after a particular period of time, if returns reduces. Plus Amazon gives warning as well if it detects too much of such activities. \n\nFlipkart on the other hand would just randomly ban accounts. A few people got their accounts banned for very less offense.",
        "> FK will fuck you six ways to Sundays.\n\nr/brandnewsentence\n\nLmfao",
        "Yes I actually know a few people who got their Flipkart account banned just after a couple of returns.\n\nWhat I don't understand is one of those Friends bitched about FK's support to me for over a week, all gaalis abc swear words were used, she never got her refund, But she's STILL shopping from Flipkart. Says she gets better deals and all she had to do was make another account.  \n\nIt's like someone dumping you and you make a fake account to continue to chat with them. Completely baffling.",
        "Yo lmao",
        "Poma",
        "File complaint in consumer court, threaten Flipkart with it over customer support and social media. Works better than the regular way",
        "Does this have open box delivery?",
        "Yeah I agree but I doubt I'll get a better deal offline because its going to be on sale for less than 20k",
        "Which iPad is getting under 20K bro? Don't buy the older gens if you're thinking about it. You can get those in under 15K offline or second hand.",
        "Bhai I think Tera reason galat ja rha hai return ke liye, esliye delivery boy cancel kr rha hai , mtlb agr reason shi hoga jaise received wrong item (completely diff. product) to i think delivery boy accept kr lega",
        "Yaar Bhai agr 500-1000₹ ka item hai, to court Jana jyada mehnga padega instead of refund",
        "I’ve ordered 6 pairs of shoes over the past few months from Flipkart and each time it has been an open-box delivery. The first time around, I received a soiled product but didn’t realize it while receiving the product as I was in a hurry. I raised a complaint explaining everything and they still accepted the return without any fuss.",
        "Keep trying",
        "I don't understand why people still order products from Flipkart.",
        "Flipkart is going down soon just like jabong / snapdeal\n\nOnly Amazon will live",
        "Haan Binny Bansal ne personally aake tere box mai duplicate shoes rakhe. Got it!\n\nLearn the difference between Flipkart and the seller first and always opt for open box deliveries second.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Flipkart scammed me",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I ordered Puma RSZ shoes from Flipkart 20 days ago. It was selling at a very discounted price i.e, 2770 and the seller was RetailNet who's a well known seller. So, when I opened the Package the shoe box was of puma but when opened the box there was a pair of cheap quality shoes which sells on roadside markets. I'm contacting Flipkart from 20 days and I talked to roughly 30 support executives. They told me to share the photos many times. They always accept my return request after that but the delivery executive never picks up the product and say to me that he can only picks up the product if it matches the ordered product. After he rejects the pickup I always got a message that my pickup is rejected because it was damaged. My pickup is rejected 5 times and everytime i have to repeat the process of contacting Flipkart customer support. I'm a premium plus member of Flipkart and have been shopping here from 10+ years and shopped for more than 10 lakhs. Is there anything I can do?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "my day on Reddit does not goes without a \"Flipkart Scam\" post every day The person collecting the *return* will tell you what check is failing if you ask him/her. It could be that he has to either check what you are returning against a photo or check the printed brand name on the product, but do check. Based on the response, you might have to change the *reason* for return. The checks done during collection vary based on the *reason* selected. Consumer court. Also you are active on reddit and still ordered from fuckkart, kinda your fault as well. But what's done is done. File a complaint on consumer court asap and let fuckkart know as well. video of unboxing? 😂 Ordered Puma, got Upma. Sure them. It'll probably take you years. Our govt sucks peen. Man trusts Scamkart too much.. 🤡 Damn😂😂 Flipkart has been scamming ppl . My mother ordered 2 pair of slippers and they gave only one . It was of 200 or smthing so we didn't report. But this is 2000 try contacting them Amazon frankly deals with these kind of issues better. They have a no questions asked return if you can find their customer care forum and lodge the complaint with them. Best option, cash on delivery, open the packages I front of the delivery person Maja aya To be fair sixfivesix is a fairly reputed brand , sponsoring many football kits. Well , sucks to be scammed. File consumer court, threaten Flipkart consumer care Big sale coming in Flipkart post like this is going to too damn high. Never buy anything form Flipkart I hate so many smartphone are exclusive to Flipkart + unnecessary packing fees and no way to return defective product to Flipkart Bc Flipkart sb ko hi scam kr raha h saw many posts of Flipkart scam on reddit in past few months Now Flipkart is not an Indian company As Far as i know, Flipkart has an open box delivery policy now. You have an option to check the product before accepting. Hahahaha amazon trying hard this year. I think it's more like sellers scamming customer and not flipkart but I am not saying that flipkart is not responsible they should only let verified sellers to sell on their website and remove all the non verified sellers. I am starting to think this is a new marketing strategy from amazon Bro . Unboxing video will be only considered to prove them wrong. And if you haven't done they nothing will be done. They want video evidence like cctv or self shot unbox video ! I have been with the same it was the seller's fault . I havent made the unboxing video but had cctv footage after they asked for video . I got return and 20 supercoins as a compensation. Why do you guys use flipkart? Flipkart hai hi F se...shuru... Doesn't flipkart do open box delivery for shoes as well? Hehe one time they sent me wrong tshirt. pick up guy rejected once but when i contacted customer support, they refunded me beforehand and picked up the tshirt the next day. Sure 😊 bhai FK ke itne scams sun ke darr ke maine jab mobile order kia tha puri video record ki delivery ke time no risk at all sab start krdo ye krna Should be a separate sub for fkartscam ? Same with me I ordered adidas shoes from myntra but got trash clothes inside instead. Myntra has become such a scam these days there's this one r/FuckFlipkart Its a scam.. nothing in that sub 🤣 I have no idea why are people still ordering from KlipFart. Does the court even do anything useful? yeah it was created 3d ago probably and that would work too for scams maybe Bhai itna time invest karne ke bad kuch pasand ata hai, 5 minute aur laga or unboxing video bhi bana Lia Karo irrespective of the item ordered Ye Myntra Flipkart dono ne Aisa khel chalu kar diya hai pehle nahi karte the abhi July maine redtape ke shoes mangaye the lekin mere pass bhi different product aaya tha lekin tab bina kuch pucheble gaya tha ab pata kya chutiyapa shuru kiya hai inhone. And yet people keep buying from them! If you used a CC for the purchase, raise a dispute. You have all the proof needed, and banks usually act in consumers' favor. Wow, shopped for more than 10 lakhs. Welcome to digital India. Post this on r/flopkart I made one by the name of r/flopkart. There is not much activity there yet. I am trying to promote it under such posts. Be great if you guys could post such posts there as well. Amazon has their tool kit out there to destroy Flipkart to ashes with these scams. Why are you leaking trade secrets I always got original products at good price till now 😞😞. The customer support is not denying to for the return but delivery executive always cancelled it. They are rearranging the pickup again and again. Why do people continue to use Flipkart👁👄👁 I got pepma. Double scam. Yes it takes time but they’ll resolve for sure. It happened to me couple of times. I have already sent the images to Flipkart support and they accepted my return that i got different product in the box and they are continuously saying that wishmaster should've pick your order but the wishmaster telling me that he needs the exact product which is a white colored puma shoes. But when he fails the product he writes the reason \"product damaged\". I don't know if the courier team is behind all this. I forgor... why are people still ordering from flipkart? The prices are attractive 😭 Listen, never order these things from flipkart/amazon even though the prices are super good and cheap … control your urge. The best platform to purchase shoes , clothes etc. is AJIO or the official website of the brands. Unfortunately no video😭. Sixfivesix? Was the upma worth what you paid for the puma? I used it once as the pixel line-up is unfortunately a Flipkart exclusive and not available offline The shoes that you recieved are from sixfivesix brand Yeah that's how they do it. Soon the 'return window' will be closed. So u won't be eligible for return/refund. This happened to me once, ans I just switched to Croma after that. Ur complaint will be like a post on any social media. They will see it, but will they like and reply? Who knows. Nahh bro it's a local brand. They probably copied their logo but this brand name is AIRDRON Ofc it is. They get paid BY the Flipkart. And most probably paid hefty extra, just to be able to do this. Bruh lmao The local brand airdron seems like a ripoff of sixfivesix Its gonna be tough then . bro got a pair of airjordans and is complaining. 💀💀 It would still have been acceptable if that seller had given a shoe of a well known brand lets say Wrogn or lee cooper etc, but this one never even saw anywhere ugh. Sorry u had to face this issue bro. I really like flipkart cuz I get the most bizzare pricing there as compared to amazon. Got 20 pairs of shoes thanks to flipkart and myntra. But with all these recent scams going on with flipkart, kinda losing trust. Also flipkart’s customer service is shit. I dont know why it even exists. Also they bought myntra so ig in a couple of months the same thing will start happening to myntra users as well. Out of topic question, i am also a Plus Premium member like you. Could you tell me how many supercoins u got for the shoe order. Cuz flipkart shows that if u are plus premium u get upto 300 supercoins. But for some reason my supercoins are limited to only 100 even though I am plus premium. Post it in X Similiar happened with me today, I have ordered a size 9 Black shoe, but today I received a size 10 -White shoe of a different model. Let's hope they approve my return🤞 been there, done that. i once ordered a 'Noise Smartwatch' for my cousins bday. never received it. and everytime i made a call to their customer service, woh bas hold pe dal dete hai. pata nahi kaha kaha se log bitha rakhna hai inhone. i threatened to take the matter to court thats when i got my refund. took me 2 months. ive learnt my lesson, never again. Always make a video of opening a package. I always do after Vega helmets scammed me. Because there are many abusive customers who will put cheap shoes inside original packaging and ask for replacement by hiding the original one, that way they keep both. This is exactly the reason why I use credit cards. You will have the chance to dispute and get the money back from the credit card company. Classic - if it’s too good to be true - then you know 1. Consumer court 2. Chargeback/Dispute the transaction if paid using credit card, debit card or UPI 🥲🙏 Wasn't their open delivery service provided to u? Nowadays Flipkart courier guy opens the package right in front of me, to assure that it is what I ordered? Man u could have atleast recorded ur order🤦🏽‍♂️ Flipkart as of for the sales and discounts are good it's just their system is bad when it comes to delivery. Some loophole being used by the middle man during the process. Atleast record ur unboxing vid even if it's not Flipkart Scam and Flipkart? I thought they were straight as an Arrow. If they keep this up it might become next SnapDeal. We need competition, letting Amazon become a market monopoly is going to suck. Not that it is going to be of any help. They are now selling a new loyalty program named VIP for 499 which supposedly have priority customer support access. forget or file a case Help me with your order id Once I got PUMP ;( And after that if you complains again and again they will do nothing and will block your account With the upcoming sale, a PSA is important for everyone I think: 1) ALWAYS make a video of your unboxings. And not with one hand opening the box and other holding the phone/camera.. place it somewhere or give the camera to a friend/family member to record.. There should be no cuts and the box should be visible at all times. 2) If you're opting for open box delivery be 150% certain the product is perfectly fine. Do NOT compromise at all. If you feel even 0.1% doubt that there's something wrong with it, reject the order. Because once you accept an OTD delivery and then you discover an issue FK will fuck you six ways to Sundays. 3) If you're exchanging an old mobile, again: RECORD the exchange.. and ask the delivery boy's name _on camera_. Trust me. When they know their name and face are on film their tendency to do bullshit reduces a LOT. 4) Finally, do not buy something just because it's on sale, or it _looks_ to be under a discount. Use a price tracker app/website like Keepa to check a product's price history. Chances are the product was always available at the same price but just inflated to MRP 1-2 days before the sale then lowered again and being shown to you as a discount. Hahhahaha🤣🤣🤣 Make some pinned posts on it first. Something like PSA for Flipkart users Or \"Got Scammed by Flipkart? Read this first\" And write a neat and concise helpful article giving people helpful tips and tricks and advice on what to do _before_ they buy from Flipkart and after they get scammed. YOU need to be active over there to get people to be active over there. If you want some assistance let me know I can be a mod And just FYI to people who think they can return indefinitely: Amazon suspends/bans your account if you return too many products. If a specific area has more returns than normal they ban the entire pincode sometimes I was thinking of buying a Google Pixel 7a, but because they only sell on Flipkart. So now I am buying an iPhone 15. Never trust Flipkart. Just tweet on X with all Flipkart handles you can find… worked for me once on Myntra.. as it directly goes to marketing heads etc. they may call you and refund.. worth a try Amazon Executive: Sir what should we do to destroy Flipkart? Boss: Wait. AE: Yes, sir.. waiting.. what to do? Boss: No I mean we just have to wait and they'll destroy themselves Hey try Twitter. Same happened to me. I complained via tweet & they responded soon & my query got resolved that is why i never purchase anything from flipkart for shoes i usually buy then from Ajio it has huge discounts too Faced similar case a month during an apparel purchase. Rejected my request multiple times. Had to write to their grievance department and then they accepted You got the Air Lebrons! The airledrons 😂😂 I was planning to order mobile worth 50k.. thanks for the headsup man.. Another day another Flipkart scam 😒 Idk about getting blocked, but I do agree there is some high resistance in contacting support after the delays in pickup starts to happen. If you’re still ordering from flipkart after seeing so many horror stories on here it’s your fault. Just file a customer court complaint online, there are several videos on it on youtube. I did the same for my A.C when they were not taking it back for a month. Hey thanks man. That’s great advice. I’ll take care of this first. And sure I’d love to have another mod. Since I don’t have as much know how about Reddit as others. Reach out on Twitter. They'll contact you directly. Also, look for grievance officer of flipkart and email directly. Worked for me. Buy a 3rd copy and exchange it. DO NOT BUY BRANDED SHOES FROM FLIPKART,MYNTRA ,AMAZON. They sale first copies. Buy directly from their store or check tataliq luxury. Seems like from Flipkart warehouse, the shoes inside were Puma only, but later on somebody changed it and took the real one. they are limited edition Airdrons..lucky u I miss my grandma's upma with rasam. Really good. He has already raised the returh request within the return window. It doesn't matter now I'll keep that in mind 100 is the maximum limit per order Same brand? How can i dispute the upi transaction? Open box delivery is not available for every product 😕 Order ID - OD329093801604364100 Are you with Flipkart though? But 100 is for Plus members only. In flipkart it shows that Plus Premium members get upto 300 per order 👺👺 Yeah, the brand was atleast the same! You really Raised your budget from 40k to 75k They contacted me through Instagram comments but still it didn't help. I have to make an account to post on X 😕 Good hai bhai be educated + and blind dumbfucks 🗿🗣️ This is what happens when you deal with Flipkart, Myntra, phone pe. I just hate that without Flipkart Amazon gets to have a monopoly. Will they respond to a new account with zero followers? Can you share contact information of their grievance department? Keep on trying and don't talk to usual customer care executives, ask for their superior. Ask them for justification for rejection request. I have a similar experience with flipkart. I ordered one co-ord set of a well known brand but received a cheap knockoff of a local brand. I tried replacing it but the delivery person won't accept the package citing different product. I tried to return for 15 days straight,went on call with numerous customer care agents. In the end, they said we cant do anything as return window is closed. Such a scam company. Am I the only one who has never faced any issues with Flipkart but faced all kinds of issues with amazon I will auction them soon. Do you wanna bid? You sell this to me, I will pay 100 good rupees Yes definitely It's not your fault. I know people who ordered brand new shoes and then return their torn shoes to flipkart 🤣🤣 that's why now myntra flipkart are very strict in return of products Try the NCH Open box delivery hoti to order karna safe hai? Why do you all recommend non standard paths as the first step? Just start with a police complaint. Just send them a message saying you're going to the police. Did u make an unboxing video? The same thing happened with me I ordered a pair of Nike sneakers and received Jordans worth 3x of what i ordered Stopped purchasing from Flipkart since 2017. Is pixel worth buying in India?? Heard that phone overheats and battery life is terrible. Also after sales service is very slow. Something similar happened to me, at the end only a strong worded tweet was able to get me a refund. Haven't ordered from Flipkart since. It's ridiculous that the delivery executive won't accept the product because it doesn't look like the product that's seen on the site, when that's exactly the reason you're returning the product! sigh. Did you pay via credit card? If yes, then raise a dispute. Keep all the communications. Also try raising a case on INGRAM [https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/user/](https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/user/) I have heard the resolutions are quicker here. Lol loved the name Why do people keep buying from Flipkart is beyond my understanding! r/onlinescamsindia I'm sorry you had a bad experience, however at this point willingly buying from Flipkart is like going to a casino drunk. I've Ingram does nothing from their end, I've confirmed it on their helpline. It's only the platform where you register a complaint, it's on the company whether they resolve it or not. Excitel shit is not refunding my security money for more than 6 months and I've my complaint from over a month on Ingram and those Excitel pos didn't bother to return my money. You have to lodge complaint on edaakhil. Thanks. :) Jokes on you I got Anupama instead; no complains at all — ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Croma is lit. I once went and tested speakers for quite long twice there and the staff was very cooperative. Didn't force us to buy either. It was 500 cheaper on Amazon but because of their service, we felt it right to purchase it from there. You support the things you want to see after all Well people are forced to buy because of the brand exclusive deals. Like they only sell on flipkart. Especially smartphone brands. I wish this practice was made illegal. You are lucky. At least you didn’t PAMA Stop using flipkart. It's time for this company to go. Yeah well AJIO fucked up for me, I placed a return request and pickup guy re arranged it for the next day, next day no one came, I called the pickup company number and they said that that guy who was supposed to pick it up is on leave, we will pick next day. Guess what , on the next once again no one came and now it's showing that my pick-up is on hold. Meanwhile all Ajio customer support doing is nothing..same message we are investigating this blah blah. Also it's impossible to get in touch with a real human from Ajio support over call. In a discount store I found a pair of \"Adidos\" sneakers in a genuine (looking) Adidas box. It was pretty funny. Really bad stitching and color, they were a crap knockoff ohhh , thats so frustrating. Although I recommended it only because of the fact that the sellers on AJIO are directly the brands so there is a less chance of getting scammed. It's likely that someone replaced it. Retailnet is a very reputed seller. I am guessing it's Flipkart itself through some dodgy holding companies. Idk why y'all keep ordering from there. Order from Amazon and if still skeptical check seller rating before buying . Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I think you should tweet and share it to us we will retweet and add fire to you problems maybe they will then respond same problem happened to me they will reach you directly in DMs and try to solve issue why do people still even order from there I've had same experience with LG TV of 30k. File a grievance at the e-consumer court website. Here your case will be resolved within a week. First day ordering shoes online buddy 🙂 I've stopped buying from Flipkart, only Amazon or directly from companys website Same happened with me! It totally has!!? Immediately file a report against filpkart in consumer court I only purchase on Flipkart if its the cheaper alternatve and I always avail the open box delivery option, no issues so far. Have you used edaakhil? I’m willing to file one. I’d appreciate any guidance or steps. bhai ko puma ke dam mein Airdrondon mil gaye Hehe Lol wtf is Airdron? It's shit. Battery life is absolute trash. That’s Nike Jordan’s cousin , X Airdron’s. You earned em.. 😊 So I used Consumer Court against Amazon for the first time in my life a few months ago, yes it was useful but people throw it around here as if it's easy and free (it's not). Firstly you have to make a free online complaint using the Court's portal website against the company - and most people write a long rant which gets automatically rejected, you have to use short standard legal sentences which stick to the facts. After the company inevitably lies saying they've refunded you or you signed to accept delivery and so the product must be legit / fine, you then have to pay a flat Rs. 5000 fee (no matter how much you're claiming) for a judge to look at your case and decide... That's when the company will actually back down and refund you, but it takes about 2 months and most people don't know how to write the Court complaint properly. People are not forced to buy, they are persuaded to buy. You can just not buy it from there Wtf? Why pay more to judge when we already pay our taxes so these govt employees can get paid, when we already paid for a non-delivered product? We're just getting a refund back and the judge just has to click a button to send a strict notice to the company for a simple refund lol...? You always have to pay a nominal fee when you want to escalate a case to real court, that's how most legal systems work, otherwise people would be spamming them with time wasting cases. From what ik service isn't available, which makes it a bad choice imo. Tax stuff? Flipkart is notoriously bad and they will never refund you and their customer service sucks ass. Best bet would be to charge back with your bank. Omg, this is all so stupid. If Gobiji can just pass anti-consumer protection laws across India like US has and start penalizing these companies into bankruptcy, they'll all fall in line in terms of proper refunds and fix their nonsense supply and shipment operations. Also, looks like a startup can fix a lot of these issues the govt has with AI based solutions to cut down on the amount of work involved JUST for a simple refund. Or hell even have the filer call in...₹5k and 2 months+ for resolution smh. Will you get reinforcement for the 5k? Some phones are exclusively sold on Flipkart :( I could ask for it yes, and I could even bill for my time dealing with the matter (based on hours dealing it * my current hourly salary) but once I finally got the refund I was so tired I just gave up. Stop offering them any business. These asswipes need to die down as a company filled with Indian scam filth. Yes, the open-box delivery option was not there?Or did you provide OTP to the delivery guy without checking? I was thinking about getting an ipad during big billion days, now I'm contemplating whether I should or not. *Chuna Log bol bol ke thak chuke hain ki flipkart pe mehenge/ reasonably mehenge item na khareedo, par sabko vahin jaake apna paisa dena hai. Jhelo ab. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Are you sure for shoes it's not available? I purchased a mobile, ac, fridge all were open box delivery. Not buying means missing out on a great product. Other resellers always sell at an inflated price and unofficial support. Funny thing. My friend ordered Apple Macbook Air 7 months ago. He received it fortunately but serial number is different from the invoice. Based upon the activation he got a mail after 6 months that his product is going out of warranty. He contacted flipkart, they gave an option for refund or replacement. He has been communicating from past two weeks or so, yet they didnt initiated the process. Why do you keep ordering from flipkart, don't you see a post regularly about flipkart scams. If you had enough braincells you would have shifted to amazon. Enjoy premium plus member of flipkart.

I didn't do much.. don't make the same mistake.. Contact Flipkart. Explicitly explaining the issue. If the return isn't don't maybe file a consumer court complaint against Flipkart. (process is completely online) Never ever buy shoes online. Always try and buy. Most online shoes are fake. Still ordering from Flipkart, are we? Likes to live life dangerously, don’t we? I lost ₹3499/- from Flipkart. Never got back the amount. It was for a graphic tablet. Had booked it for cash on delivery, but then i had an option to pay online through UPI before the delivery happens. So i did that. But when the delivery guy came he said that there's no payment done against my order. But when i told him that i have paid using GPay, he said that the payment will get refunded back to my account, so no worries. And i paid him during delivery. Again. No amount was refunded. Contacted Flipkart, and they said they've refunded to my account, contacted the bank but they never got it. It became a cycle of contacting both these parties for 3 months. Until i was fed up. Never used Flipkart again. I had been scammed once too my return order was also cancelled I called to an executive and gave him a piece of my mind Welcome to the club. File a chargeback through your credit/debit card if you can, because they haven't delivered the product. Also start a case through consumer court. Don't trust Flipkart, they don't want to help you. Amazon pices are a bit higher, but I received correct product most of the time…and if not, they replace or refund without much hassle. Fuck flipkart, they act like they doing some charity when asked return or refund It's not Flipkart, it's the people who do this. I've worked at Amazon in a management role, while I'll agree to this but I think its obvious why they do this, most of the times the delivery operatives are the root cause, we wait clear the staff, recaliberate the modus operandi and restart the function. half of puma shoes circulated in the cities are fake.

Well I mean it's believable, let's say you buy groceries they'll easily be 3-5k, add same random shit which you think you've always needed but you never use easily 500-1k, I for one have bought a lot of shoes online and buy a pair every alternate month 3-4k, add phones, earphones, random electronics add that it could easily go to 1.5L and I haven't added big ticket items like tv fridge etc. the audacity ! If you are a supposed Flipkart dedicated buyer then I can't say, I feel sorry for you. It's been 5 years since Flipkart service quality has dropped down at the bottom. STOP BUYING FROM THAT SHITTY SITE AND CRYING ABOUT IT ONLINE. I got scammed 5 years ago and I never purchased anything after that. I trust Amazon a lot more than Flipkart. Haa almost safe hota, agar scam nikla to delivery boy wapis lekar chala jata I bought one from Amazon a few years ago and it's been working absolutely fine. I still recorded the entire unboxing experience but there were no issues. My advice is either get it via offline shops, where you may get a better deal since those shops are under a lot more pressure to make a sale because of online shopping... Or get it from Amazon. Avoid Flipkart if you can. Amazon isn't perfect either but their support is leagues better than Flipkart, that's for sure my reddit day is incomplete without the regular flipkart scam It is operating in India as before so tax is the same as before selling to Walmart. But the methods of doing business and all have been changed after selling to Walmart. there is this same post (different stuff) every single day for flipkart scams. u guys don't have to buy ANYTHING from flipkart . its not worth it. The consequences of consumerism... Yeah but Flipkart clearly doesn’t care about its customers either. Hi.. I want some help on buying speakers. We previously had a Sony HT but looking for a change. Can I DM? Congratulations you got your First Airdron. Lucky guy, still a dream for many. Airdron or air jordan? This All businesses care for their customers brother. It's obviously your fault. Why order from Flipkart when everyone knows that it's always a scam. Ok I'm gonna do this It's just an empty sub, not a scam. Idk why people say scam to mean they're disappointed. Open box option was not there Bro I'm not active here😞 I'm also losing hope Can I file chargeback on an upi transaction? Are you a Flipkart employee? I think it's a collaboration of nike with a drone company 😢 No. File a case with consumer court. Also it seems Puma has it's own website where it sells and ships stuff. Many brands like Samsung, Agaro etc. have their own websites. Seems better than going through Amazon and Flipkart. This has been happening for quite some time and the likelihood of such events will increase even more. I myself experienced it once. Customer support will keep on delaying it inordinately as it involves no amount of profit to the company. This is the reason I always say there needs to be a well-defined law ordering delivery companies to make open order deliveries, wherein a customer may open and verify the authenticity of the package at the time of delivery. If unsatisfied, the customer may cancel the order right away and hand over the package back to the delivery agent immediately. That'd save a lot of time and trouble for both ends. This should be made mandatory. No. Being in business teaches you to care for customers. Rarely, it happens that a company tends to be an asshole and mostly happens when they don't have competition in the market Sure 10 lakh ka kya kharid liya hai flipkart se aaj tak be??? Anyways, AIRDRON Been there OP is in an even worse situation. Ordered puma received AIRDRON. Yes, stop shopping from Flipkart I'm not sure whether I would be upset Every time I have an issue with Flipkart and they take days to resolve it, I always resort to \"If this isn't resolved by tomorrow, I'll have no choice but to start using Amazon for all my purchases. I'm a longtime customer of Flipkart and I've never been so disappointed with your service\". It always works and I get a refund or replacement within the next few hours. I use Amazon a lot too but sometimes Flipkart has better deals for stuff like Dettol cleaning liquid, Godrej handwash, etc. But I don't tell them that and just give them an ultimatum and that lights a fire under their asses to make sure my issue is resolved. Most recent example was when I bought 2x handwash packs but got only one despite paying for both. Went back and forth for a week where they said they'd look into it until I gave them that ultimatum. Amazon, on the other hand, has been flawless. That's good to know. I remember reading that there are some pincodes in UP which are banned because there were a lot of cases of customer taking the order and beating up the delivery when he asked for payment Bhai mobile phones, ACs, fridge, washing machine and so on in the span of 9-10 years will add up to that amount Ohhh achha ha to thik hai. Me choti cheeze hi mangwata hu to relate nai kar paya achanak se. Dind a lawyer friend and send them a legal notice Well I'm from UP as well that was very rare and in these instances the products are insuredand the driver would've been paid for his losses after an investigation, what the issue we had to deal with a lot was customers exploiting return policies buying local electronics, shoes etc and trying to return them as original and get the refund. Thus we had to put this cross verification system in place, so to be really blunt if you don't check your product at the time of purchase don't expect the delivery operative to be the same. Completely agree. Which is why I tell everyone to make unboxing videos since even if the customer is saying the truth, the e-commerce has no idea without proof. well unboxing videos can be disputed as well, there are certain things you should keep in mind 1) Shoot the package BEFORE you're opening it ensuring its not tampered with. 2) Make no cuts in the video. 3) If possible try to get it unboxed it infront of the delivery executive and shoot that aswell. 4) Avoid buying electronics/ pc components/perfumes >5-10k on these website. That account ban is something Flipkart does too lol and at a much less offense too. Amazon's account banning for multiple returns are more robust and has higher counts. That even gets reset after a particular period of time, if returns reduces. Plus Amazon gives warning as well if it detects too much of such activities. Flipkart on the other hand would just randomly ban accounts. A few people got their accounts banned for very less offense. > FK will fuck you six ways to Sundays. r/brandnewsentence Lmfao Yes I actually know a few people who got their Flipkart account banned just after a couple of returns. What I don't understand is one of those Friends bitched about FK's support to me for over a week, all gaalis abc swear words were used, she never got her refund, But she's STILL shopping from Flipkart. Says she gets better deals and all she had to do was make another account. It's like someone dumping you and you make a fake account to continue to chat with them. Completely baffling. Yo lmao Poma File complaint in consumer court, threaten Flipkart with it over customer support and social media. Works better than the regular way Does this have open box delivery? Yeah I agree but I doubt I'll get a better deal offline because its going to be on sale for less than 20k Which iPad is getting under 20K bro? Don't buy the older gens if you're thinking about it. You can get those in under 15K offline or second hand. Bhai I think Tera reason galat ja rha hai return ke liye, esliye delivery boy cancel kr rha hai , mtlb agr reason shi hoga jaise received wrong item (completely diff. product) to i think delivery boy accept kr lega Yaar Bhai agr 500-1000₹ ka item hai, to court Jana jyada mehnga padega instead of refund I’ve ordered 6 pairs of shoes over the past few months from Flipkart and each time it has been an open-box delivery. The first time around, I received a soiled product but didn’t realize it while receiving the product as I was in a hurry. I raised a complaint explaining everything and they still accepted the return without any fuss. Keep trying I don't understand why people still order products from Flipkart. Flipkart is going down soon just like jabong / snapdeal Only Amazon will live Haan Binny Bansal ne personally aake tere box mai duplicate shoes rakhe. Got it! Learn the difference between Flipkart and the seller first and always opt for open box deliveries second. Flipkart sucks Its 9th gen so it seems like a good deal other than that in the 30k range the new xaiomi pad 6 is actually very good Never order shoes from e commerce sites You got klipfarted. #ScamKart Bro didn't even get an Abibas You guys still using Flipkart? I was under the impression that consumer courts were less tedious, I guess Indian bureaucratic system remains the same everywhere. Never do shopping with Flipkart full of scammers i always shop from Amazon only trustworthy even if sellers try to dupe or scam they support customers that's the most important thing u need to know about amazon Lmao There is a shoe called \" Abibas\" but it's fake copy \"Adidas\" is being sold on Flipkart Don't expect better support from Flipkart. Contact National Consumer Helpline. Your issue will be sorted in 2 days. Now bhut shutney and enjaay! Atleast you haven’t got pumba 😂 When will people learn to unbox expensive shit with video recordings? You can't prove anything now with these 2 pics. Ah my bad I forgot Walmart acquired it a while ago, I thought they too registered on one of those countries with low taxes. Fuck Flipkart and Amazon is 💯 times better in terms of service and delivery"
