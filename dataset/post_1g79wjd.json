The child enthusiastically wants to go abroad, he sees a new dream; but there is no assessment of which institution he is going to, which country he is going to,\" said Mr Dhankhar \n\n\"It is estimated that in 2024, about 13 lakh students went abroad. An assessment is being made about what will happen to their future, people are now understanding how bright their future would have been if they had studied here,\" said Mr Dhankhar.\n\nThis drain, said the Vice President has created a \"hole of $6 billion in our foreign exchange\".\n\nThe Vice President called upon industry leaders to make students aware and help stop the brain drain and loss of foreign exchange.\n\n\"Imagine: if 6 billion US dollars are funneled into improving infrastructure of educational institutions, where we will stand! I call this a forex drain and brain drain. This should not happen. It is the responsibility of the institutions to make their students aware of the foreign situation,\" he said further.\n\nEducation morphing into a business is not good for the future of the nation, underscored the Vice President.\n\n\"In some cases, it is even taking the shape of extortion. This is a matter of concern,\" he said, calling for optimum use of technology to give quality education to the students.\n\nThe Vice President also praised the National Education Policy which he called a \"game changer\".",
