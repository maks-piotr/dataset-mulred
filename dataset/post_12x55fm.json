        "So, two things to remember :\n\n1) Yes, you are allowed to use the camera and click photos. In fact, when you come down the stairs in the beginning, the first thing you'll notice is people getting their photos clicked right next to the Amrit Sarovar.\nI saw the photos you've provided in the post, and people take such photos all the time. All good.\n\n2) However, you need to remember one thing. This is a religious site, a place of worship for millions. This is not a tourist hub. If you are gonna come here, then partake in Langar Seva (Free food) and try to listen and understand the prayers. \n\nThere are English translations provided on the last display as well. Try to understand the message that is being propagated. It's a fantastic religion. Full of love.\n\nI hope you have a great time here :)",
