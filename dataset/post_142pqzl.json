Now unfortunately he lost the cook book (it seemed v handy) and all my googling couldn't help me, couldn't even find the spice brand (due to it being local, or simply more generic, I think).\n\nDo any of you know more about this brand, how to use it best or even have the cookbook? I'd love to use it as a guide :)\n\nThanks in advance! \n\n[Pic of one of the spice packages](https://imgur.com/a/jL93ZQY), I have Hot Chili, Super Tea Masala, Chicken Masala and I think Bombay Curry",
