        "> The defendant side went on to submit that they chose the name because “Defendant No. 1 (Keshav Tulsiani, partner/director of Adidas Weaving Mills, Adidas Textile Industries and Adidas Merchandise Private Limited) held deep admiration for his elder sister, addressed as ‘ADI’ in the Sindhi community. This admiration was so profound that he was commonly described as her devotee (‘Das’ in Sindhi). Consequently, the term “ADIDAS” (to mean devotee of elder sister) was conceived, combining ‘ADI’ (elder sister) and ‘DAS’ (devotee), to reflect this familial devotion.”\n\nIs this a stupid comedy show going on? 😂 what is this argument, and how did this case run for 13 long years.
