        "It's been a week since I deleted Valorant, I don't think I will go another week but I'll try. So far, I'm going out and spending my time more effectively. I'm going into offline games too, currently playing RDR2 and Spiderman remastered.",
        "currently i have been playing Apex legends mobile a lot, and currently enjoying a lot, and this is growing a lot in the INDIA gaming community.",
        "Xenoblade chronicles 3 on Switch. So damn charming, beautiful, and full of depth that I will probably go through the entire series afterwards.",
        "I liked the game a lot but all of my friends still prefer playing PUBG/BGMI so couldn't play much. I am getting a new laptop tho so I'll most probably shift to playing PC games now.",
        "Started playing valorant, though I usually play rpg games and should have stuck to them, well turns out I suck at shooting games",
        "Right now Making the most inbred dynasty in crusader king 3",
        "nameless cat, it's a solid platformer game for android, really short and sweet. 10/10 highly recommend",
        "Man i would love to buy crusader king 3 but it looks like one of those game which has steep of a learning curve, whic is kind of intimidating. Will you recommend it to someone who's never played any crusader king games ?",
        "I started with CK3. It is very beginner friendly compared to most of other paradox interactive games of same type. But it has a very steep learning curve. It is nowhere beginner friedndly in what to do next. You probably need to watch hours of tutorail to get going. Also your are going to fail your first 5-6 campaigns. But once you learn the ropes it is very fun game. You can do almost anything. It feels good but it lacks content as compared to ck2 as it is newer. But is more astthtically pleasant. And have a better UI",
        "I see, i don't mind watching tutorials at all. I like the type of games that puts you in the action right away without any sort of hand holding and lets you test the game mechanics, civ 5 is the best example and i absolutely love that game. Part of the reason CK 3 caught my eyes is how similar it looked to civ 5, i mean it may not be similar at all but the strategy element was there and im a huge fan of that. Thanks a lot for replying kind stranger, i will most certainly be grabbing the game right away."
