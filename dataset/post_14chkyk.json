Less women are working now than they were in the past, only about 30% of women are doing paid work. Dowry is also much more common than it was in the past, now 80-90% of Hindu weddings involve dowry.",

        "Dowry is less common now than it was even 10 years ago, you just didn't know about it. \n\nAlso what you are talking about is low workforce participation of Women and not Unemployment.

And who can blame them, working long hours for little money as envisioned by our Capitalist Society is a tiresome chore. Household chores are way less exhausting than 8-9 hours of manual labour.",

To ensure divorced women don't have to struggle to survive and also discouraging marriage for the sole purpose of divorce. \n\nSecondly Filing False cases of DV should be treated as Extortion under IPC and carry a 3 year prison sentence.",

        "Look up some stats. Dowry rates have increased significantly. \n\nWomen don't quit because they want to, they are mostly forced by their family or husband to quit their job. Housewives are more likely to die due to suicide than someone who's working. Women who are not working are more desirable to men. Women mostly don't want to quit their jobs but quit out of pressure. If household chores are less exhausting then why don't men do them? the majority of men can't do household chores and even if the wife is working they still expect her to do everything.",

        "Have you ever wondered why only less than 20% of women work? The official number of female taxpayers is somewhere like 18-20% \n\nIt is because of ONLY ONE thing/notion - \"before a wedding, a girl is the responsibility of father and after the wedding, she is the responsibility of husband\"\n\nIndian courts, including the Supreme court, constantly reinforce this notion. It is because of this notion, wives \"demand\" maintenance and courts grant the maintenance\n\nWith this notion, females and their family have to ensure that they get married to a man with good salary. If marriage doesn't work, she will get maintenance from courts. If marriage works, then also all good - Females will say they will take care of household work... Where washing is done by Washing machine and they have maids or servants for cleaning, cooking etc\n\nJust imagine if this notion was absent, then what would happen. Females will also have to think about getting a job like males do. And when that happens, females would strive to get a job before marriage\n\nNow, it is a common understanding that the probability of giving dowry in the wedding of a working girl is lesser than that of the non-working girl\n\nSame goes with female foeticide, domestic violence, reporting of rape and almost all the bad things or crimes associated with females in India\n\n\nAnother perspective on dowry is like this...\n\nTake all the dowry cases filed in India in the last 10 years.. atleast in 80% of the cases, you will find that the wife has alleged that husband and his family demanded dowry before wedding and yet the girl and her family still went ahead with the wedding. It is like i know that the other party wants dowry but still i married him and now i am \"surprised\" or \"harassed\" because the other party is asking for dowry.\nBy the way, in all these 80% cases, the wife would be alleging that the husband and family would have demanded an exorbitant amount of dowry or some luxury car and the bride would have paid some amount with a promise to pay remaining in few days/months and/or given Fortuner instead of Mercedes/Audi etc\n\nMy question is simple - why didn't the girl and her family back out of the wedding when the dowry demand was made? Were they expecting some change of heart OR some miracle? Unfortunately, not even the Indian courts ask this question. They mechanically assume that the girl's allegations are true\n\nAnother aspect....if a groom is asking for 25L/50L/1Cr as cash at the time of wedding, then he is asking for dowry\nBut if a wife is asking for 25L/50L/1Cr as maintenance/alimony for giving divorce in court, then it is considered her \"right\"? Why shouldn't it considered as extortion?\n\n\nAnother thing which i have observed personally in many weddings is if a groom doesn't want or accepts dowry, then the bride and her family members \"assume\" that the groom has something wrong in his past. Simply put, bride and her family wants to give dowry\n\n\nSo if you ask me, in a nutshell, all the bad things/crimes associated with females in today's world can be significantly reduced if the concept of maintenance is addressed properly\n\nIf you ask me, wives should not get maintenance unless she has stayed for minimum 5 years with the husband and if she has stayed for 5 years without any breaks, then she should get max 1 month of maintenance per 1 year of cohabitation. And this is applicable for non-working women or women who left their jobs to take care of children. And this 1 month of maintenance per year of cohabitation would put pressure on the wife to get a job. Anyways, there are organisations who run special hiring for women with career breaks - what is stopping these women to opt for these hiring programs and integrate in working force again. \n\nIn the long run, either the Indian Judiciary should allow prenuptial agreements or ban maintenance altogether. That way, females will always be working and earning and hence it will be difficult for anyone including the husbands to take them for granted.\n\nIf Females really want to be considered equal to Males, they have to first forego all the benefits and entitlements they have as females. You can't be considered equal if you keep getting benefits\n\n\nI will give you a real life example - You can Google to verify my claims. Read the life story of Neena Gupta, a veteran actress. She became pregnant and her boyfriend/father of her child was Vivian Richards who asked Neena Gupta to abort the child. But Neena Gupta went ahead with the child and raised that child. This was possible only because Neena Gupta was working and was financially independent.\nThis was in the era around 1980 when gender determination was legal in India and advertisements used to be run by clinics saying pay XYZ amount now to avoid dowry in the future\n\nJust reverse the situation and put a non-working and dependent wife in a similar situation. Can a wife avoid abortion if her husband or his family force her?",
        "The woman's family wants them to marry someone 'good' and most of those grooms take dowry. In fact the more they earn the more dowry they take. The woman's parents want someone with money to marry so they are fine paying dowry for the sake of this. \n\nI'm all for prenups but maintenance after marriage is needed. I'm also for women paying alimony or child support after divorce if she earns more and men don't take dowry or are abusive. If a man's family takes dowry then he should pay maintenance, if he doesn't want to then he shouldn't ask for dowry or ask his wife to quit her job.  \n\nWhat if the husband is abusive and forces her to quit her job? She can't stay for 5 years for the sake of maintenance. This will be different if she's earning but outright banning it can't be done.",
        "If the husband is abusive, she will know in the first year and she can walk out of the marriage and find a job. \n\nBy the way, forcing a wife to leave her job is also considered domestic violence or harassment. If she is earning, she can walk out of the marriage instead of leaving the job.\n\nAnd what about divorces where wives were abusive and harassed husband? Aren't husbands humans too?\n\nIf there are children from marriage, then it is the responsibility of both the parents not only husbands. A lot of divorces happen because of incompatibility between husband and wife.\n\n\nI am against maintenance for lifetime. Put a limit on the time period. I can show many cases where wife stayed for 5 days after wedding and then left the house and got maintenance for life. Even if you don't agree with the minimum 5 year limit on maintenance, Courts and government can't run lifetime pension for the wife at the expense of husband. There has to be a limit on the maximum number of months a wife is eligible for maintenance. For example, children are eligible for maintenance till they attain 18 years of age. But if a wife gets divorced at the age of 25 say, she is eligible for 50 years of maintenance assuming she lives till 75 years of age.\n\nIf the husband is at fault, there are criminal laws and women use them to file cases on the husband to the extent that the supreme court has called it  \"Legal Terrorism\". But where r the criminal laws to prosecute wife if they have harassed husband? Why aren't all the laws gender neutral?\n\nIn a way, you are saying a wife should NOT be staying with an abusive husband but she should be ok to get money from him? Is that what you call equality?\nThat's exactly the survey the OP has posted about.\n\n\nAnd your first statement about finding a \"good\" and \"earning\" husband is what I am talking about. Why can't the girl earning good enough herself before and after the wedding? What is stopping her?\n\nAlso, if a guy and his family is asking for dowry, why has she to marry that good earning guy? If the girl is earning herself, then she can decide whom she wants to marry. \n\nEffectively, you are supporting my point that a girl and her family has following 3 options:\n\nOption 1- Give high dowry to high earning guy and be harassed for more dowry later\nOption 2- Select a low earning guy and live happily without being harassed for dowry\nOption 3- Don't marry and stay single\n\nIf you see, of all the 3 options, Option 1 is the worse and yet most of the girls and their families will choose that option. My point is simple - Girl and their families can't claim innocence if they knowingly married a guy who has asked for dowry\n\nOption 2 and 3 require the girl to be working as well which they will do only if they want to work\n\nIf you ask me, if a sufficient number of girls refuse to marry dowry seeker guys, then the demand for dowry will reduce over time because these dowry seeker guys will also have a choice between Dowry less marriage OR remaining unmarried",
        "I also mentioned in that reply that I believe even women should pay alimony if they earns more. Even if the roles were switched I believe the same thing should happen. If the wife was abusive to the husband and she earns more then she should pay alimony. \n\nI said it depends on the case, I don't agree with a complete ban on maintenance or a 5 year waiting period. It should be on a case to case basis, there is no one size fits all. I'm not saying that the husband should pay alimony in every case nor am I saying that alimony shouldn't be given at all.\n\nAbuse is not always visible initially, and it doesn't always start in the first year of marriage.",
        "Bro did he just say feminism=love jihad? \n\nCan you please explain me how would that work?",
        "Given the choice bw long working hours and being a homemaker i too would choose being a homemaker, but if i become a homemaker who will earn money for me? No woman would ever marry a guy who doesn't earn a single rupee. A job isn't an achievement or a privilege it's working all day for pennies so that someone else can buy a fifth bungalow.\n\nBeing a homemaker is safer and easier, Suicide Rates for men >>>> Suicide Rates for Women.",
        "And exactly this is my point... Why it has to be conditional on who earns more and who earns less? \n\nMaintenance, in India, is conditional on case by case basis atleast for the last 2 generations, i.e. last 20-40 years.\n\nI have NOT suggested a complete ban on maintenance. My only point is it cannot be lifelong\n\nPut a limit on the number of months for maintenance\n\nWhat state do you want a woman to be? Remain dependent on maintenance from husband for life OR become earning and financially independent on her own\n\n\nHere, maintenance means maintenance for wife. I am in favour of changing maintenance for children till they attain 18 years of age",
        "It really depends on the case whether to have a limit or not.",
        "Then no limit should be in the rarest of the rare cases. It should be an exception not a rule.",
        "Women don't always choose to be a homemaker. Having a career gives people freedom and autonomy, and even if the guy doesn't earn a lot he still asks wife to leave her job. I'm not saying that a guy shouldn't earn but if he and his wife are earning similar they still don't do household work and childcare. Women do want to work, not everyone wants to be a housewife. Housewives don't have as much freedom and fall victim to domestic violence and abuse more than working women. \n\nThere are women who are willing to work and earn more than their husbands but even then they are pressured to quit their jobs.\n\nSuicide rate for housewives>>> suicide rate for working women (I'm not talking about men in this, why are you bringing it up)"

And what about divorces where wives were abusive and harassed husband? Aren't husbands humans too? If there are children from marriage, then it is the responsibility of both the parents not only husbands. A lot of divorces happen because of incompatibility between husband and wife. I am against maintenance for lifetime. Put a limit on the time period. I can show many cases where wife stayed for 5 days after wedding and then left the house and got maintenance for life. Even if you don't agree with the minimum 5 year limit on maintenance, Courts and government can't run lifetime pension for the wife at the expense of husband. There has to be a limit on the maximum number of months a wife is eligible for maintenance. For example, children are eligible for maintenance till they attain 18 years of age. But if a wife gets divorced at the age of 25 say, she is eligible for 50 years of maintenance assuming she lives till 75 years of age. If the husband is at fault, there are criminal laws and women use them to file cases on the husband to the extent that the supreme court has called it \"Legal Terrorism\". But where r the criminal laws to prosecute wife if they have harassed husband? Why aren't all the laws gender neutral? In a way, you are saying a wife should NOT be staying with an abusive husband but she should be ok to get money from him? Is that what you call equality? That's exactly the survey the OP has posted about. And your first statement about finding a \"good\" and \"earning\" husband is what I am talking about. Why can't the girl earning good enough herself before and after the wedding? What is stopping her? Also, if a guy and his family is asking for dowry, why has she to marry that good earning guy? If the girl is earning herself, then she can decide whom she wants to marry. Effectively, you are supporting my point that a girl and her family has following 3 options: Option 1- Give high dowry to high earning guy and be harassed for more dowry later Option 2- Select a low earning guy and live happily without being harassed for dowry Option 3- Don't marry and stay single If you see, of all the 3 options, Option 1 is the worse and yet most of the girls and their families will choose that option. My point is simple - Girl and their families can't claim innocence if they knowingly married a guy who has asked for dowry Option 2 and 3 require the girl to be working as well which they will do only if they want to work If you ask me, if a sufficient number of girls refuse to marry dowry seeker guys, then the demand for dowry will reduce over time because these dowry seeker guys will also have a choice between Dowry less marriage OR remaining unmarried I also mentioned in that reply that I believe even women should pay alimony if they earns more. Even if the roles were switched I believe the same thing should happen. If the wife was abusive to the husband and she earns more then she should pay alimony. I said it depends on the case, I don't agree with a complete ban on maintenance or a 5 year waiting period. It should be on a case to case basis, there is no one size fits all. I'm not saying that the husband should pay alimony in every case nor am I saying that alimony shouldn't be given at all. Abuse is not always visible initially, and it doesn't always start in the first year of marriage. Bro did he just say feminism=love jihad? Can you please explain me how would that work? Given the choice bw long working hours and being a homemaker i too would choose being a homemaker, but if i become a homemaker who will earn money for me? No woman would ever marry a guy who doesn't earn a single rupee. A job isn't an achievement or a privilege it's working all day for pennies so that someone else can buy a fifth bungalow. Being a homemaker is safer and easier, Suicide Rates for men >>>> Suicide Rates for Women. And exactly this is my point... Why it has to be conditional on who earns more and who earns less? Maintenance, in India, is conditional on case by case basis atleast for the last 2 generations, i.e. last 20-40 years. I have NOT suggested a complete ban on maintenance. My only point is it cannot be lifelong Put a limit on the number of months for maintenance What state do you want a woman to be? Remain dependent on maintenance from husband for life OR become earning and financially independent on her own Here, maintenance means maintenance for wife. I am in favour of changing maintenance for children till they attain 18 years of age It really depends on the case whether to have a limit or not. Then no limit should be in the rarest of the rare cases. It should be an exception not a rule. Women don't always choose to be a homemaker. Having a career gives people freedom and autonomy, and even if the guy doesn't earn a lot he still asks wife to leave her job. I'm not saying that a guy shouldn't earn but if he and his wife are earning similar they still don't do household work and childcare. Women do want to work, not everyone wants to be a housewife. Housewives don't have as much freedom and fall victim to domestic violence and abuse more than working women. There are women who are willing to work and earn more than their husbands but even then they are pressured to quit their jobs. Suicide rate for housewives>>> suicide rate for working women (I'm not talking about men in this, why are you bringing it up)"
