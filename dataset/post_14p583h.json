        "Hi,\n\nI am 18, and I recently started earning. I am currently investing 10% of my overall income in safe smallcases like All Weather Investing. I also have many future plans when my income increases, but I would love to hear from you all, if there is something I should do or learn early for my future investment journey.",

I want to keep my diet healthy and yet keep my budget low. My monthly pocket money is ₹15k. Need to keep it near it.Help me achieve that.",
        "A few questions:\n\n* Emergency funds - why is there a 3k contribution to emergency fund every month. Is it because you are building it up? Since, at one point, you'll stop contributing in it, that will reduce that 3k allocation\n* Mobile - I'm assuming this is more than just mobile. It might include your primary internet, but if not, you can reduce the allocation here. There are plenty of options to reduce that\n* Why invest in MF if your expenses > 'income'. First build you emergency fund, and then, once it is built, then start contributing to MFs. Just by optimizing on these two, you should be able to get your outgo lower than income.\n* For food, look for tiffin services or something. I'm assuming you are 'eating out' every time. Aside from it being relatively unhealthy, it is definitely a huge expense burden. Tiffin services would be your best option. Even better would be if you can cook yourself. I suspect you won't have the time and/or skill. I can tell you, not only will you eat healthy but your expenses would go down to less than to 20-25%",
        "How do u increase your cibil or experian credit score? And owning how many accounts start affecting the cibil n experian rating?       \n(I have 6 acc and an app says it's fair, what would make it good or excellent?)",
