        "So one thing I've been trying to get a good grasp on lately is comp ranges. I know 1.6lpm is a big meme here and all, but lacking something like levels.fyi I'm having a hard time understanding what's a reasonable target to negotiate for. It kind of bit me when I was negotiating recently and I went slightly above what they considered reasonable. It's fine and all, and I ended up getting a good deal anyway, but I wanted to know what kind of comp ranges are \"expected\" for different experience levels. Thanks in advance!",

This method of quoting a figure higher than their expectation actually will turn them on their head. Also, make sure you know how much you think you are worth.
