        "An average restaurant takes 20 mins to deliver a dish in your hand. Swiggy/Zomato takes 40 minutes to pick it from the restaurant and deliver even from a restaurant that is 2km away from home. Many times on weekends or if the delivery person is new to the region it takes more time than this. Better take a pick up, wait for 20 mins and then take it back in 5-10 minutes. The quality of food is retained better than online delivery.\n\nAlso, if food doesn't come as per quality, you have a person to complain to. Swiggy Zomato barely takes any responsibility for missed items in delivery or quality of food. I have had bad experience with a dish that I personally took. The restaurant accepted the mistake and compensated with an extra dish on the next order. Yes, I visit that restaurant frequently, so the person who takes orders knows me by face.",
