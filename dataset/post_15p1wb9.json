Hinduism like other polytheistic beliefs have elaborate myths surrounding each god and it is hard even for a Hindu to completely know each and every myth. The 10 mile view from above is that there are major gods and minor gods, this god depicted here *could* be a major goddess. The role of each god in the Hindu pantheon is fluid so nobody can tell you with certainty what is the role of this god particularly. \n\nTLDR: it is very complicated like other polytheistic beliefs to understand each and every god. The consensus seems to be she is avatar or form of a major Hindu goddess mahashakthi.",

The sages like Shree Ramakrishna, Bamdev, or any sage, so to speak, had followed one of these 10 methods in their whole spiritual journey, so I won't classify it as either history or mythology, but just as knowledge, methods, manuals, or whatever fits this particular basis. Now the question is whether the methods are authentic or not. I don't have any proof except to refer to the sages and rishis like Shree Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Vamdev, Ramprasad, etc.",
        "While you are not wrong that Shiva is the God of Dance (Nataraaj), he is a primordial God of many attributes, and many of his attributes like his beauty and love of art are described as very graceful and feminine. \"Bhairavi\" is the female embodiment of \"Bhairav.\"  \n\nIn Hindu mythology, Shiva is often genderfluid because he came into being before Brahma even began creating the universe. As such, even though Shiva embodies strong masculine aspects and is a symbol of masculine fertility, he himself is not of either gender because he came into being before the concept of gender was created.  \n\nSo you are not wrong: this is indeed a statue of dancing Shiva, represented as Bhairavi. Just as a statue of Krishna is also a statue of warrior Vishnu.",

In both cultures meditation acts as a medium for transcendence, Detachment, Enlightenment etc but Buddhism is more like Hindusim without the woven tribal practices (Which is what Siddhartha Gautama wanted to renounce and found barbaric).\n\nLong story short: Its a far-eastern way of depiction of a a goddess who is an offshoot of Kali.

    "light_cleaned_comments": "just ask the indians around you, theres a lot of indians in canada Yeah I'll be the crazy white dude walking around with a statue asking what it is , did I ask an offense question? nah, if they get offensive, tell them to go back to india I love India are you some bot trying to bait me ? Have a good day buddy nah not bot, just an indian who knows theres a fuckton of indians in canada Enjoy yourself today, legitimately asking about this statue I have . Goddess Kali i guess no idea about the drink Ohh thanks , interesting thank you ! Welcome To me it looks like a version of Avalokite≈õvara. Buddhist deity. Looks like rice and vermilion stuck to some glue Some stupid idol which the idol worshipers(idiotic Hindus )pray and devote their life to F u Interesting, my mom left me her , it says goddess of darkness ,death and destruction , but also creation circle of life or something. Hey thanks! Have a great day Yeah by that description that's definitely Goddess Kali. At least we don't worship pedosüòÇ Yeah pretty much same can be said about your black stone. Which you must visit and Circle around. Pray in its direction. Idolatory much? Wtf is wrong with you? Ignore the turnip. yes exactly, must be some ghee from long time never even stated that though so quite wild to assume that, but theres a good amount of hindus in canada so just ask those also go back to india ahem immigrant/migrant whatever the name you want to call yourself ahem ahem At least I made it out. People like you will stay in the shithole you were raised in with those opinions. Mf had to poop in a simple discussion! Natyarani Real id se aao BJP IT CELL.. This guy got two brain cells, both fighting for third position. Godess Durga, we call Maa(mother) Durga Looks like safe for work goddess kaali without the decapitated head. Don't know what the other thing is. im so confused, can you give some context for this From the description in your comment, seems like Kali but I don't see any weapons so I really doubt it. Most probably some other deity. Goddess Kali At least we don't worship pedophile and a suicide bomber with no body he died b4 his face reveal Avg terrorist Maa durga The goddess has ten different forms as a part of Mahashakti. Some are common like goddess Durga, Goddess Kali, Goddess Laxmi. My guess is this a statue of Goddess Bhairavi. This may be a Buddhist depiction of a goddess too as a part of Buddhism practices tantra and has their own depiction of Mahavidyas (the goddesses). Avalokitesvara man if you're gonna troll find a better username Well we don't shove our religion to someone else by loudspeakers... Typical pedo worshipers, blah blah blah!! Haha, you make these joke coz this is the only religion you can joke about. Yeah, it's my religion, and I can joke about it. You don't own it. That's why we're better. Sorry what's the joke here? Well said! Lateer Buddhist, not Hindu, hence the confusion here. You're better off asking r/Thailand - they do late Buddhism that is all about political monks, badly imitated Hindu deities, and little about the Middle Path, which is essentially non-deist. Yup, make fun of other religions and get stoned. I get stoned while making fun of my own religion. Shaivites who smoke chillums are literally this. So chill. i think that's poorly prepared teeka because there is rice oil and kumkum someone didn't follow directions right oh what's the joke you insecure duckling. Bro go watch Indiana Jones üòÇ Adi Shakti üòÅGood One. It's like some people are just wanting to invite radicalism in their religion as they don't like some of the only things that are better in their religion. It has become dick measuring contest at this point... contesting which of them can actually come out as the worst. And do it with your religion get lynched or beaten to death. As the dearly departed Hitchens said - they read 1984 thinking it was an instruction manual instead of a cautionary tale. Are these story's parables ? I've looked this up now, thanks for all the help peoples! It's pretty confusing and extremely interesting. I don‚Äôt really know about the Idol itself but the second Picture has ‚ÄòRosary pea‚Äô (the seeds) in it. Now as far as I am aware Rosary Pea is mostly associated with Lord Vishnu/Krishna and often used in Religious Practices/rituals. Have you heard about Google lens? I'd suggest you to check it out if you haven't Mythology would be more fitting than parables. She seems to be Goddess Durga - worshipped for power . She usually rides a Lion and each of their 8 to 16 or more hands - depending upon which puran or story , parable to go for has weapons of destruction ( to destroy demon Asura) and weapons of creation . Imo it is a statue of dancing Shiva. That‚Äôs Justin Trudeau‚Äôs mother Nope its maa durga dancing shiva natraja pose is different and he doesn't have multiple hands equipping different weapons. Why adi and not puri? That‚Äôs yo mama! Also, the universal mama!üòÇ Hoping your comment was sarcasm/joke. Plissss man. Yep I sorry I got broken humour Hahahaha. Have fun brother! Brother I definitely tried that , it gave me 5 different answers, I'd suggest having a nice day ... Adi(‡§Ü‡§¶‡§ø) means 'first' or 'the beginning'. Aadhi(‡§Ü‡§ß‡§ø) means half. What book can I read to learn about all this , super interesting That could be Tara maa too ( goddess Tara devi) she is oftenly worshipped in western parts of India . You can know more if you search TRS on YouTube and watch the Rajarshi nandy sir Bro Sidha bol ki akhay kumar hun. Ok thank you . Appreciate it :) This idol has eight arms. Godess Durga is depicted with 8 or 10 arms. So that matches. Next identifier is - what does she carry in each of her hands? What she carries is not cast in stone - these are the common ones - chakra, trident, mace, spear, bow and arrow, sword, lotus , conch I don't see any arms in this picture - I can see the conch and the lotus. This is why the most popular answer says it's a buddhist incarnation of Godess Durga. Buddhism has a tantric sect. Godess Durga is a Tantric Godess. Godess Durga is not worshipped in a domestic altar because of tantric methods of worship. In this picture someone bought a tantric buddhist idol of Durga and lit a lamp in front of it. That is the boss villian of The Black Company. Takes just about a lifetime to get into all Hindu gods and mythology I know bro. It was just a stupid joke in a similar sense to [this](https://youtube.com/shorts/hzTvsdxZ7_0?feature=share) I think it‚Äôs the same I saw at Angkor wat I was confused as well , the nice people from r/india did a nice job of answering my questions I have better pics , I have candles lit around it because it's beautiful Possibly, also known as Guanyin. Just some black magic stuff nothing harmful In West Bengal state of India, we call her Maa Durga (Mother = Maa) Vajrayan bodhisattava . A well lit picture would help understand more what he/she holds in hand and that can be very helpful avg nri I don't know how to post another pic . Maa durga Have a good day , enjoy every moment Is this some type of inside joke lol That's hastar Tum badhiya insaan ho, sorry I judged you . The closest analogy is ancient Egyptian and Greek gods. Every god has multiple different names and origin story (avatar) depending on period, region and local culture. Hinduism like other polytheistic beliefs have elaborate myths surrounding each god and it is hard even for a Hindu to completely know each and every myth. The 10 mile view from above is that there are major gods and minor gods, this god depicted here *could* be a major goddess. The role of each god in the Hindu pantheon is fluid so nobody can tell you with certainty what is the role of this god particularly. TLDR: it is very complicated like other polytheistic beliefs to understand each and every god. The consensus seems to be she is avatar or form of a major Hindu goddess mahashakthi. Yeah I searched it up and I'm even more confused. Is this why the Buddhist meditate , it's a lot to process Start with Devi by devdutt patnaik . Its a great book . Thank you , I just opened up to a new world , I'm excited to explore. no im genuinely saying ive no idea about the drink Pic 1 is of goddess kali You're welcome. I would recommend you explore hinduism from books rather than asking practitioners. There study of hinduism from western scholars perspective might be less overwhelming to non-practitioner. Bro decapitated head goddess is Chinnamasta. Agreed devdutt patnaik have whole series of books related to Indian mythology he also had a tv show in EPIC now I don't exactly remember the language it was presented. Nahh the Buddhist meditate to take their minds off this convoluted mess, all of it is staggeringly hard to make heads and tails of This makes the old testament 1+1 lol . Thanks for you're insight, I appreciate it . Its looks like devil Guanyin Bodhisattva Correction! Not myth or mythology it's our history. wrong sub Looks like just some black magic stuff going on. Nothing serious /s It was in hindi . It was called devlok with devdutt pattnaik . I meant in hand. Chinnamasta with Shiv paintings are raunchy though. üòÇ white guy couldn't follow the recipe it seems The second one is paayasam i think. No, it's not history; it's knowledge. The dasho maha vidya represents the 10 different knowledges of tantra and each comprises different methods to attain enlightenment, some methods are considered tougher than others. The sages like Shree Ramakrishna, Bamdev, or any sage, so to speak, had followed one of these 10 methods in their whole spiritual journey, so I won't classify it as either history or mythology, but just as knowledge, methods, manuals, or whatever fits this particular basis. Now the question is whether the methods are authentic or not. I don't have any proof except to refer to the sages and rishis like Shree Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Vamdev, Ramprasad, etc. While you are not wrong that Shiva is the God of Dance (Nataraaj), he is a primordial God of many attributes, and many of his attributes like his beauty and love of art are described as very graceful and feminine. \"Bhairavi\" is the female embodiment of \"Bhairav.\" In Hindu mythology, Shiva is often genderfluid because he came into being before Brahma even began creating the universe. As such, even though Shiva embodies strong masculine aspects and is a symbol of masculine fertility, he himself is not of either gender because he came into being before the concept of gender was created. So you are not wrong: this is indeed a statue of dancing Shiva, represented as Bhairavi. Just as a statue of Krishna is also a statue of warrior Vishnu. Not the western but the eastern part of India. > Not myth or mythology it's our history. Correction! it's not history it's definitely mythology and folklore Words have meanings Goddess Kali, derived from word Kaal . Kaali symbolises Time as a force of universe Exactly! Every religion, and society likes to call myths history. There are several [books](https://books.google.com/books?id=CaIUAAAAQBAJ) written on this very topic. Goes to show how blinded are by our own stories. Lol this comment wouldn't be out of place in a Douglas Adams book Try giving this goddess food as offering aka Bhog, everyday. I would love if you give a explanation when downvoting. You've just stumbled upon an ancient Canadian deity - the Goddess of Maple Syrup! üçÅü•û First Pic - Hindu Goddess Second Pic - Ghee, vermillion, rice and moong beans (Materials used for worshipping or arti/pooja) Lord \"SHIVA \" Upon Close Observation.... Definitely it's 'Mahakaal' Sorry bud don't know This is BUDDHA ü§£ü§£ I guess this a previously used idol. So when you place idols in the temple of your home, you do a ritual before placing it. Seems like dried kumkum powder, rice and maybe it was stuck down with industrial glue Tim Durga is commonly depicted with three eyes, and commonly is riding a lion. Don't see either of those features here, but that doesn't mean it isn't her Is this Chris must list YouTube guy? I will not call it stories as it is an active part of religion or Dharma for some people. It can be called mythology though if you want to give a name. Hindu literature/scripture is huge. There is actually no end if you want to learn in depth. Every single thing has doble and triple underlying meaning. Like the concept of Mahavidya or Goddesses, some may say they are actual deities but for some it is the manifestation of outcome of certain type of human nature, for some different form of energy or shakti. I only know a little. I read about these as the philosophies are very interesting. There are different sects of Buddhism - keep in mind that they have different ways of understanding the world In the beginning the universe was made by who knows which god, this has made many people very angry and is widely regarded as a controversial move. That is not a drink , it's just the bottom part of the idol #2 Looks like someone made an undercooked omelette to offer the Goddess. Yes, I agree. I'm assuming it's the Godsess Annapoorna, a form of goddess Parvati. Annapoorna is the goddess of food and nourishment. We in South India, keep the idol on a small saucer like thing filled with rice. This is Goddess Durga who has different avatars like in Kali etc. There are also Family Clan deities (this is how that often mentioned figure of India having like 3 Million or was it 33 Million Gods comes from, no one knows exactly how many there are). Basically nearly every Indian has (had for those who converted to another religion) a Family God (that can be from among the Major God's or it's Avatars but often isn't either). But many Indians (depending on class, urban-rural, generational dynamic) don't even know their own Family/Clan dieties. And most if not basically super majority of these are undocumented so there's no Wikipedia pages, heck they likely won't even be known to other Indians in other parts of the same State, let alone region of India. This is South Asia's memetic (original meaning) contribution to human species. Only peer South Asia would have is entire Africa as whole. No other society has a quicker dynamic to creating God's than South Asia/India. Even Mahatma Gandhi is an example of this, that's not his real name, he just got semi-deified. Give it another century or so it could be more than just Semi. idk but that feel like lord Vishnu. (Hardcore Hindu) To me it seems like a non-classical form of Nataraja, or possibly Shiva in one of his \"Nrittamurti\" or dancing forms. However, the figure certainly has some Buddhist iconographical elements‚Äîseemingly from Hevajra, but I could be wrong. The only iconographical elements I can spot are the khatvanga, vajra, sutra, the halo of fire, legs in the araimandi pose, and a fruit that's possibly shreephal or a pomegranate. It's a really interesting sculpture, and I'm sure that a clearer image would make it easier to unpack its iconography. If I'm not wrong I'm pretty sure that is the destroyer of worlds Shiva himself Yes I don't think it is Durga, but maybe it was made by someone non-Hindu You should give a read to devi bhagavatam or devi mahatmya. Also,if you are a convert/trying to practice Hinduism/please do naam jaap(chanting the name of lord), whatever deity you believe in. At last,if you are trying to learn about my religion,please definitely read these 3 books:- Ramayana, Mahabharata (not a religious scripture, but you will enjoy it's story definitely) and bhagvat geeta(not to forget mentioning that every diety has also it's geeta such as Shiva geeta,Parvati geeta etc.) Might be, mother of hastar Hinduism is an amoral, perverse, and degenerate religion. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. OP, I highly encourage you to research it to better appreciate your own Western heritage. Start with the book \"Mysticism and morality\" by Arthur Danto. He was an analytical philosopher best known for his theories on art, and he did a fantastic job picking apart the worldview of Hinduism, as well it's very questionable ethical framework. RIP Danto (2013). Nah bro, no trishul Can u send a normal picture, cos most of the details are not clear due to darkness and picture quality Looks like ma Durga or kali (cos there is a skull on one hand) Hinduism is a woven set of cultures, practices and religion from multiple regionswhich makes it very difficult to know the complete idea of each and every practice. A female goddess holding a unblommed lotus, skull, conch and weapons? She is more like a offshoot of a Kali Deity although in a buddhist form. Buddhism is an mixed offshoot from Hinduism, it incorporates the practices of Far-eastern religions/cultures hence you will find a lot of things similar, for example : meditation. In both cultures meditation acts as a medium for transcendence, Detachment, Enlightenment etc but Buddhism is more like Hindusim without the woven tribal practices (Which is what Siddhartha Gautama wanted to renounce and found barbaric). Long story short: Its a far-eastern way of depiction of a a goddess who is an offshoot of Kali. What it defines: Motherly figure. I would put it in line of China/Nepal or a wild guess at Thailand. I may be wrong of the Land of Origin. Feel free to correct me, I find all this very interesting! Google Sinbad vs Kali. Good scrap! Why'd you look at her bottom Hi op. Fellow non-Indian & non Hindu here.. [This here video](https://youtu.be/czN0fzK1LVI) might be of interest. India and Hinduism are amazingly immersive if you‚Äôre interested in them. I can only speak from my outsider perspective but I have travelled the country for many years and her religion is as vast and diverse as the country and people themselves. It was the British Empire as I understand it , for the sake of classifying the spoils in its plunder-house, who tried to ringfence it as a single spiritual philosophy (‚Äúthe religion of the Hindoo‚Äù) but that didn‚Äôt end too well lol. If you think it‚Äôll be something you might enjoy maybe research and practice a little [basic yoga](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ds9-mtL6Bdo?feature=share) You might find places like [Varanasi](https://youtu.be/cxBuiWE5OsI) very interesting too. I‚Äôm heading out for trip number 12 in a few days! Bhadrakali I believe Where did you find/buy it? Did someone give it to you? Okay Hope that made you feel better. Text me on tg - onelifeonelegacy, I will share you complete material to understand hindusim, it's quite interesting and logical once you start reading. You can easily understand everything and nothing is complicated as these other people in comment section says. how many gods do you have? Stinky Hinduism isn't an Abrahamic religion it's more like combined collection of different faiths and beliefs in india every clan,family,region,caste has different beliefs and over the years more beliefs are being added about same deity but afaik this is a statue of ma durga If you are atheist then ok but if not then don't call it mythology The deity is shown in abhaya mudra I guess Thanks for not answering the question. It is Vishnu, The Hindu God. Oh just stfu. 33 million is a little bit too much. I guess you were talking about \"33 koti\" Gods and Goddesses we hear so frequently. But here 'koti' means 'types of' not 'crore'. Get lost bitch. No one's giving out bones here. Drool somewhere else Happens when you are inconsistent about the stories you tell across a millennia. The Dude from overwatch In our family we have a tradition of worshipping Devi Durga with 18 arms. But your probably correct it does seems like a Buddhist incarnation. Dude. Studying comparative religions is awesome. Regardless of your background, learning about other faiths is eye-opening. There are Catholic experts on Buddhism, atheists teaching biblical history, christians who are experts in islam. None of them are weak-minded snowflakes whose own beliefs wither in the light of day fck im blind Oh yeah I didnt notice. My bad , sry That's Avalokeshwara bodhisattva Cancel God on social media ? Envisaged by shamans of yore. You might identify it as paganism. It is beautiful! Where did you find it? In any case don‚Äôt call it a mythology ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I can‚Äôt find any better matching term to describe different versions of religious epics, folklore and gods. Idk bro argue kya hi krun inseh You should ask in Indonesian or Thailand subs. You may find the exact answer there. It might be associated with Balinese hinduism or Buddhism. It's an whole story,if you want, I can tell you. Devi /u/Better-Mud-6023 is a spammer! **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.

Bodhisattva Tara Devi Not able to find a better term and having no interest in finding out more about your culture does not imply you would reduce it down to calling it mythical. You were free to help out finding another term but you just didn‚Äôt. I am fine to call it my culture/religion. But not a myth. And I would rather be more interested in finding out why it is so at the first place rather than disregarding it completely :) Only one disregarding is you. Well, I would rather be amazed by finding out how a tale with so many available historic evidences spanning regions would have been built up. Must be an interesting thing to explore. Hence for now, I don‚Äôt think it I would reduce it down to a term like that, neither I need to explain who is disregarding what. The wide spread and diversity is truely amazing."
