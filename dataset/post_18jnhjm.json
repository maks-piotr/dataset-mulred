        "Does anyone still use Flipkart? And why?",
        "Thatâ€™s the trick you donâ€™t",
        "You mail them your concern and they'll probably call you in 2 days.",
        "type something like - human - agent",
        "Call ?",
        "Try swearing, the bots will escalate if they detect certain emotions like anger and frustration. So cussing them out will most likely get you a human rep",
        "Unless that entire loop is broken, then thereâ€™s no point lol",
        "I buy lots and lots of products from Flipkart ðŸ¤­\n\nWait I'll teach you: \n\nWrite: \"I wanna talk to your customer care agent\"\n\nThen they'll give you two options: \"Request a call\" & \"End chat\" \n\nClick on \"Request a call\" and select your phone number.\n\nThey'll then call you within 5 minutes.",
        "Define Real ðŸ¤­",
        "Directly type in your phone number and they'll ask you to select a language and call time. This worked the last time I used Flipkart. Keep us posted :)",
        "Call this no.-+91 44 4561 4700",
        "That's the neat thing, you don't.",
        "Anyother platform other than amazon for a tier 2 city people ?",
        "Just put\n Live Agent \nOr\nLive Support. They worked for me against most bots",
        "Why everyone should use Amazon only?",
        "1) Better customer support (based on my experience)\n2) Better variety and range of products\n3) Better discounts whenever applicable\n4) Not a concrete reason, but better UI/UX\n\nThese are some of the points on top of my mind.",
        "When I used to live in a tier 3 city few years back, I used to only rely on Amazon. For clothes and fashion - Myntra. For groceries, nearby subzi mandi and departmental store.",
        "India lacks a law that guides online business to operate with a minimum way to reach further and these kindof companies are just thriving by throwing customers. You see Ola, Uber everyone has setup only an automated channel that gives you limited options (what they feel they can respond as if other issues are both their problem).\n\nI hope there is an advocate who will file PIL to drive a law that makes it mandatory for companies to put up an Email complaint receiving center on which a max number of days become binding for companies to resolve issue",
        "Just abuse them and say that you want to talk to an agent, always works",
        "1. They have worst customer support ( based on my experiences)\n2. For a normal person or professional Flipkart too have all the products and range.\n3. Best discounts when it comes to steal deal on phones, appliances, etc.\n4. I guess UI/UX should be simple to appeal to people, unlike Amazon where the drill down of menus and different menus makes you feel you're lost.",

        ">when it comes to steal deal on phones,\n\nI think you misunderstood, they will literally steal your phones.",
        "This, their chat is useless",
        "Generally, if you see a chat text box that lets you type in your question, just write \"Talk to a human\" or \"Talk to a customer care agent\".\n\nI've seen this work on multiple platforms, and you get connected directly to an agent.",
        "I have seen a lot of smartphone only available on flipkart.",
        "Write consumer court. You'll get an instant call back.",
        "Not just them, every company does this nowadays. To avoid hiring human customer support for the peanuts they are paid, companies spend large amounts on AI and IVRS systems that won't give you the answer you need and won't help you with problems.\n\nThey're intentional dark patterns to prevent you from complaining and getting help from the company.\n\nWe all need to start taking legal action against companies more often.",
        "The reason you buy online is, it saves some money. Be prepared to loose that money one few of these similar situations. That is how online shopping works in India. \n\nSecond option is to buy from store near you, they will serve your all your life. You will actually save far more in money terms if you stop shopping online since many things we buy online were not even planned.",
        "I get your point...but I ve seen that in Amazon too.",
        "They're exclusive official Pixel seller. Warranty is void if you don't buy from Flipkart. Also Flipkart runs the repair/insurance service, and the same people get sent to examine the device if you try to return/refund.\n\nFlipkart is running a scam with Google's blessing.",
        "Which one? How do I do this?",
        "Also they sell nothing phone and some others too.",
        "Just say I've filed a case to consumer court. Gaand fat jaati hai unki",
        "Yeah, that too. I got a defective Pixel 6a from them. Was planning to fight them all the way, but now screw it. I'll just use the defective phone.",
        "I want to file an actual case in consumer court. And get them legally summoned to court.",

        "Damn. Shit just got serious!",
        "Connect to an agent",
        "Maybe it will turn out well, maybe it won't. My advice, better not to take such a chance. That thing is overpriced anyway. You can get basically the same experience with the cheaper a series devices. Wait a few months and buy the Pixel 7a at a heavy discount.",
        "Is it not worth at 60k ?",
        "Please don't use flipkart, myntra. Use Amazon.",
        "I use it for small electronic items. \n\n\"Appario Retail\" on amazon would be my first choice, but their prices are often quite high - so it's either flipkart or local shop.",
        "Not at all. My brother bought Pixel 7 at 50k at launch like an idiot. And he regrets it. It may have some \"premium\" features. But in reality, it's all bespoke nonsense that's just meant to have a \"premium\" feel.\n\nIt fails to record video sometimes, saying that it's overheating.......... because the amazing tech talent at Google won't use the inbuilt video encoder hardware.......",
        "Post your complain with proper order id of the product on twitter and tag flipkart and walmart.. I have worked as a customer service associate in Flipkart.",
        "It's the only way I can consider getting certain brands of mobile phones (Motorola, Nothing, Poco and Google Pixel). It sucks but I don't have an alternative (except for certain motos which can be bought in person).",
