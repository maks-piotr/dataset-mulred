        "We're going to become the worlds first 4th world country in the next 50 years.",
        "I don’t see anything wrong in this image do you guys?",
        "Isn’t India stuck 1970? All we see is technological development but no mind development",
        "This is what makes us Indians.",
        "If today every school adapts the japanese culture of basic etiquette and social customs. Then it'd take another 10 years for Indians to develop that way of living. \n\nOur way is, apna ghar saaf rahe bhale pados mein kachra fenkna pade.",
        "Is this Karnatak?",
        "Yep",
        "I think the 19870s were better than this shit.",
        "Problem is there are no strict rules and even if they are then there is corruption..if you fine rs1000 for throwing garbage he will give rs250 to policemen and he will be fine",
        "Civic sense is a big issue. It just pains to see the lack of it. But blame is hardly useful for systemic issues.\n\nWe also need to look at the other side. Humans take the path of least resistance. Are there garbage bins nearby? Are those regularly maintained? (this is also an issue when it comes to access to clean toilets or water)\n\nThere is also the broken windows theory that might explain it. If there is disorder, it leads to more. Contrarily, this is the reason why metro/airports are comparatively cleaner (yes, I have seen those pan stains in Mumbai metro :-) \n\nTLDR (IMO): If the place was proactively cleaned up (and people fined), there would be less of it.",
        "So time-travelling is a thing in 19870s?",
        "Citizens of our country only care about their culture. Rest everything comes later. Ohh guy n girl are talking! Ohh he/she is still unmarried! Ohh he/she is spending moneyy! Ohh he/she is an atheist! Ohh he/she doesn’t stand up for national anthem!\n\nTo fuck with all these things! When will we learn to become humans first?! When will we realise yeh zameen humare baap ki jaidaad nahi hain! Stupid technological changes aren’t enough. We behave like well dressed chimpanzees holding mobile phones.",
        "What's the deal with Indian society's weird relationship to garbage? Are there no garbagemen paid to collect this every day? It's not rocket science.",
        "oh my, hahaha.",
        "Stop using polythene bags for garbage disposal..",
        "It’s no 🚀 science for sure. But people who are responsible for managing the waste don’t give a 🐀’s ass & the one’s responsible to throw the waste inside waste bins don’t do so.",
        "This is what happens when garbage collectors ask money to take ur garbage",
        "Image is from Bangalore, I feel gulty, but I am one of those people dump their garbage at such places, but I’m left with no other choice. I leave for work before 9 AM, while the BBMP collection vehicle arrives around 10 AM. My area no longer has public bins or collection points. Previously, we had a towable garbage tank that the BBMP emptied regularly, but it was removed without any replacement. Now, I have to leave my trash where the old tank used to be. I wish there were better waste disposal options to avoid this situation.",
        "Plastic was a disaster to this country. Organic waste used to become one with the soil within 1 month.",

        "Piraud momant saar 🫡",
        "Nah this looks like Uttaram Pradesham",
        "Hygiene is illegal here",
        "For something as visible as garbage like that in the OP picture, that's amazing. Are there many jobs like that in India where you get paid but don't actually have to do anything? Where do I sign up?",
        "People see u either pay 100 and wait for him in the morning and hand it over to him without going to ur job like a obedient bitch because they will not pick it up even if u give them valid reasons and money or be batman",
        "Come to a 3rd world country habibi",
        "I see you have a beef with garbage collector because in our apartment building the guy collects everyone's garbage.",
        "Personal responsibility and etiquette?",
        "Hahaha! And yet I've never seen people, rich or poor, so smartly dressed and groomed as I see in India, be it on the metro in Bangalore, in a slum in Chennai, walking around the Chaminar in Hyderabad or sitting  by the river at Jog Falls... everyone impresses me with their personal hygiene (I always look sweaty and grimy and wrinkled).",
        "pic goes hard for some reason.",
        "They lack the knowledge to dress appropriately for the occasion. Personal hygiene is something I've never seen the majority of our countrymen ever care about. Most of them don't care.",

        "Filthy minds, filthy cities. \n\nLet the downvoting begin for being anti-national.",
        "Itni samajh hoti to baat hi kya thi",
        "Ah that explains why I hear people in my office say “carru”, “bussu”, “computerru”, etc.",
        "Karnataka has a lot of these scenes. The government has put up a lot of these don't litter posters but do absolutely nothing to stop it from happening.",
        "Lol fine 😂 \nLogo ne waha fine padh k aur phek k chale gaye kyu ki sab ko pata hai ki koe ky h nahi ukhad sakta.",
        "We're already there. Other 3rd world countries like Thailand, Vietnam aren't as shit as India",
        "We're already there. I've been to Palestine (West Bank) and it's nowhere as shit as India lmao",
        "Yup, that would be why haha",
        "This has to be enforced by govt>municipal corporation \nExample of such a shift can be seen in Indore. It’s not there yet but I’ve seen a lot of people going through that consciousness shift.\nMost, if not all, people in Indore do not litter in public places, they find the dustbins.\n\nThe municipality had to increase the sanitary workers and levy hefty fines along with humiliating individuals in public places whenever they caught someone littering. This thing has caught on and people have slowly started becoming conscious. \n\nEvery food stall keeps a dustbin and people use it.\n\nI wouldn’t say it is perfect but it is happening. That consciousness isn’t going come on it’s own, people need schooling to teach them this harsh lesson.",
        "Law enforcement and Judiciary are completely dysfunctional like most government systems here so no negative consequences for anything as such whether you just throw garbage and don't pickup even if its your job. There is also \"Caste system\" angle to it and in the past this job was outsourced to certain castes. Not having to deal with your own shit is subconsciously considered sign of \"superiority\"",
        "I think you're onto something there. with that subcoscious superiority. But it still amazes me, especially in Indian society where everyone seems so hypersenstive to being criticized (by their aunties, their in-laws, their neighbors, etc.) about their behavior. \n\nI mean, no one in India walks out their door saying \"Gee, I wish there were MORE shit in the street, wouldn't that be lovely?\"",
        "Exactly. Unless it is humiliation or monetary, punishments do not seem to land on Indians.",
        "Same for me also, and the bbmp guys are not regular, they come to collect randomly at random times. One weekend I was there and when I went to give he forcefully took my hand and told me without extra money he will not take the garbage.\n\nI am left with no choice. People dump it in a blank spot near my street it's the easiest thing in the world just keep a damn box there and collect from it if you don't have strict timings.",
        "It will probably make people uncomfortable, but when cleaning and sweeping is so deeply related to caste and caste pride is the first thing that is infused in most people, this is bound to happen."
