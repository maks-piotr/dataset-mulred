He was awarded the prize in literature for Gitanjali, of which this poem is a part.\n\nHowever, two audio clips began circulating on social media claiming that sister Prabha had made disparaging comments about Hindu religious practices and political leaders.\n\nOn 10 February, four persons — parents of the school’s students — approached Headmistress Sister Anitha with a complaint that Sr Prabha had made some derogatory statements against the Hindu religion and the prime minister while teaching the poem.",
