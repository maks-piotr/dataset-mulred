Let's take it 3 here for example.\n* Current GDP: $3.73 Trillion\n* Current Population: 1.43 Billion\n\nSo the total wealth of the country can be **stated as $11.19 trillion**, which also aligns with some reports from the IMF.\n\n**Top 10% of the population holds about $8.62 trillion of it, crazy!!**\n\n143 million people have this amount of wealth, which equals a GDP contribution of $2.87 trillion. This means a per capita income of about $20,084.\n\nThe PPP conversion factor for India (GDP PPP/GDP) currently stands at 3.4, which is considerably high. **As a result, the GDP PPP per capita for the top 10% of the population is approximately $68,425, surpassing the GDP per capita (PPP) of the United States, which is $64,702**. This highlights that the top 10% of India's population possesses financial resources almost on par with those in the USA. Although services in India are still developing, there is a noticeable increase in investments in this sector, indicating promising progress and potential for improvement.\n\nThis is somewhat similar to China as well, illustrating that the upper echelon of the population gains purchasing power and, consequently, a better quality of life, akin to that of a developed country. Meanwhile, the situation continues to deteriorate for the bottom 90% in a highly populated nation like ours.\n\n**Conclusion:** If these 14 million people were the only ones in the country, our nation would easily be considered developed, with vast resources and numerous opportunities. Additionally, we are currently witnessing the rise of the middle class and an all-time high growth rate. **However, it is primarily the top 10% who are contributing to or benefiting the most from these positive changes in the end.**",
