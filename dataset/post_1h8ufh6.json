    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nIâ€™m an 18-year-old male, and I had a really humiliating experience at a Bank of India branch yesterday. I need advice on what to do next. Hereâ€™s what happened:\n\nI went to deposit some money through the cash deposit machine. The first two attempts were unsuccessful, and I ended up with two useless receipts, which I tore up and threw into the dustbin nearby. A bank employeeâ€”a womanâ€”was observing me the entire time.\n\nAfter successfully depositing the money, I went to update my passbook. When I went to get it verified, another agent told me that only the woman I mentioned earlier could handle the verification. So, I approached her.\n\nOut of nowhere, she rudely accused me of spitting in the dustbin! She started yelling at me in front of at least 30 people in the bank, making me feel extremely embarrassed.\n\nI firmly told her I had not spit and asked her to check the CCTV footage to confirm. However, she refused to show the footage and kept scolding me loudly. Despite trying to defend myself, everyone in the bank seemed to believe I was at fault. I even raised my voice a bit in frustration, but honestly, I was so shaken that I couldnâ€™t handle the situation well.\n\nNow, Iâ€™m left feeling humiliated and helpless because I know I didnâ€™t do anything wrong.\n\nðŸ‘‰ What should I do next?  \nðŸ‘‰ Should I escalate this to the branch manager or higher authorities?  \nðŸ‘‰ Is it possible to formally request CCTV footage to clear my name?\n\nI am appalled by the service and behavior atÂ [u/BankofIndia\\_IN](https://x.com/BankofIndia_IN)Â Not only have I been waiting over a year for my ATM card despite multiple applications, but today I faced sheer unprofessionalism. While responsibly disposing of an useless receipt in the dustbin, a staff member falsely accused me of spitting and proceeded to lecture me rudely without verifying facts. When I requested to see the CCTV footage, they outright refused.This is not how customers should be treated. I demand immediate access to the CCTV footage, a formal apology, and swift action to resolve my ATM card issue. This level of harassment is unacceptable!Â [\\#CustomerRights](https://x.com/hashtag/CustomerRights?src=hashtag_click)Â [\\#Professionalism](https://x.com/hashtag/Professionalism?src=hashtag_click)Â [\\#BankingIssues](https://x.com/hashtag/BankingIssues?src=hashtag_click)Â Additionally, I am utterly shocked by the sheer incompetence and personal vendetta atÂ [u/BankofIndia\\_IN](https://x.com/BankofIndia_IN)Â After filling out the ATM card application form for the 1000th time and getting my motherâ€™s signature the same agent who previously falsely accused me of spitting intentionally postponed my request and told me to bring my mother again, even though she had already signed. This was nothing but a deliberate attempt to frustrate me and delay my process out of PERSONAL ANGER.  \nThis was my tweet yesterday I got a call from the bank today, but it was on my mom's phone. They mentioned they need her to come in for the ATM card. However, the agent completely ignored my request for the apology letter and the CCTV footage. I was expecting them to address those issues as well, but no mention of it at all. Looks like itâ€™s just about the ATM card for now.",
