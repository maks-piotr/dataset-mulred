It just mentions that they were getting paid in INR. \n\nFrom other articles I found out that monthly they were getting ₹19,500 for working 18 hours daily. In a city like Mumbai a maid charges ₹12000-15000 for cleaning a 3bhk house, and cooking for 4 people. This takes around 2-3 hours per day. They usually work at 3 houses, taking home almost ₹30000-45000.\n\nHinduja, a fkn billionaire family were paying approx 36 rupees per hour.

My monthly health insurance cost is ~INR 40000 and weekly groceries ~INR 10000/week IF I don't eat a single meal or snack outside. And I can afford this comfortably as a PhD student, which is one of the lowest paid among jobs anyway.\n\nAs another example, the average salary at McDonald's here is >INR 2500 an hour or an annual salary of around 50 lacs.",

        ">They reached a settlement with the victims before trial. The prosecution still chose to proceed and they still managed to get convicted. \n\nI'm not very familiar with the Swiss legal system. However, your comment makes it seem as if the following occurred:\n\n1. The victims filed a legal action against members of the Hinduja family in a **civil court** (or out of court); and\n2. The Swiss prosecutors continued to press a separate legal action against members of the Hinduja family in a **criminal court**. \n\nAgain, I'm not very familiar with the Swiss legal system. But, here in the United States, the defendant in a criminal complaint cannot evade or negate prosecution by reaching an out-of-court settlement with the victim. This is because the *victim* is not the *plaintiff*. Instead, the plaintiff is the government entity charged with enforcing whichever rules the defendant allegedly violated. \n\nSo far as I'm aware, there are cases in which a victim's decision to forgive or \"settle\" with the defendant might prompt the prosecutors to drop their claim. The same holds true if the victim insists that, for whatever reason, charges not be pressed or pursued. But the prosecutor can still make an independent decision, because writing the law--and enforcing its provisions--is not the responsibility of the victim, but the responsibility of the state. \n\nIn a situation like this, I can understand why the Swiss government might elect to overlook the provisions of a civil or out-of-court settlement. If the Swiss government did not prosecute, it would be sending a message: \"if you have money, we will overlook labor and trafficking violations so long as you make amends with the victim whensoever such violations are discovered.\" \n\n>High profile people like them don't get punished like this unless someone is out to get them. Sorry I am being cynical but this is what I have always seen.\n\nI do agree with you here. \n\nSimply being sentenced to prison for a length of time does not mean that the convicted person(s) will actually serve their entire sentence behind bars. Depending on how Swiss law is structured, the sentence could be commuted, or the convicted person could reach some sort of agreement to serve their remaining sentence in or under house arrest.",

I am sure there was lobbying effort by Hindujas. So why did they fail? They are not some random rich businessmen. They are super connected.\n\nAfter the settlement, it would have been easy to drop the case. So what's the motivating factor? Is there election in the country this year? No. Is the prosecutor wanting to enter into politics or wanting? Couldn't find anything....you know like Preet Bharara whose cases later unravelled and there was evidence of a certain bias in prosecution?\n\nThis prosecutor could very well be a very honest and upright man, but generally system doesn't allow people to reach these positions.

Again, I don't know much about the Swiss judiciary, but it typically takes some time for charges to be filed and for a case to proceed to trial. \n\nYour article indicates that the \"case\" stems from an investigation that was opened in 2018, yet a settlement was only reached and announced during the trial. If I were the prosecutor or the judge, I would find the timing at least somewhat suspect. \n\n>Yes definitely, but I looked up the prosecutor and he has dropped other high profile criminal cases when initially he was very certain about criminality.\n\nI don't know what decision-making process the prosecutor has employed, either now or in the past, but your article states that the judge explicitly referred to the civil sentence when imposing and lowering the defendants' fines and fees. \n\nSo the provisions of the settlement were considered in sentencing--if not by the prosecutor, then by the judge. \n\n>This prosecutor could very well be a very honest and upright man, but generally system doesn't allow people to reach these positions. As I said, sorry for being cynical.\n\nMaybe you're right (or maybe you're not). \n\nIf members of this family broke the law, then they are--at the very least--being held accountable. I wouldn't lament political motivations if it ensures that a pack of wealthy cunts are held liable for a gross abuse of labor. \n\nAlso, so far as accountability goes: none of the defendants bothered to attend the initial judgment hearing, citing the \"ill health\" of elder relatives.

No. They wouldn't read this Not just that they were made to work 18 hours per day. They weren't getting paid enough either, the article doesn't mention this. It just mentions that they were getting paid in INR. From other articles I found out that monthly they were getting ₹19,500 for working 18 hours daily. In a city like Mumbai a maid charges ₹12000-15000 for cleaning a 3bhk house, and cooking for 4 people. This takes around 2-3 hours per day. They usually work at 3 houses, taking home almost ₹30000-45000. Hinduja, a fkn billionaire family were paying approx 36 rupees per hour. While in Mumbai maid makes 134 rupees per hour, not a lot I know. But not too bad when you realise a b.tech graduate fresher in tcs makes 130 rupees per hour. And here... Write a 300 word essay and get bailed.. Big W though... They consented without force hence those charges were dropped. Which essentially means they are helpless and got exploited = 4 years Jail for that. Horrible people, horrible values. They don’t hire locals or people with legal permits because they if they did they wouldn’t be able to pay them slave wages and expect them to work unreasonable hours. They’re billionaires, they couldn’t paid the minimum wage and it wouldn’t make a dent in their net worth. They want to be cruel, they’re feudal lords in Hermès. That applies to many women trafficked for sex as well. They are helpless by their circumstances (which traffickers didn’t create I.e their own poverty back home). I’m so happy that Swiss courts decided to defend Law and Order instead of buckling to Money and political power Imagine getting a MLA, MP, Indian Oligarch prosecuted impartially in India for mistreating a worker But they don’t consent to being in a brothel or being sold, they are kidnapped. The workers have no choice but to accept the meagre wages as there are millions at home to take their place. It's also a kind of blackmail To give more context about the degree of exploitation and how little their salary would mean here, as a person residing in Switzerland, my rent for a room in a five person flat is ~INR 75000 and I do not even live in a city or an 'expensive' area. My monthly expense for transport to work is ~INR 9500 (quite cheap because I only need to take a bus and its 15 mins away). My monthly health insurance cost is ~INR 40000 and weekly groceries ~INR 10000/week IF I don't eat a single meal or snack outside. And I can afford this comfortably as a PhD student, which is one of the lowest paid among jobs anyway. As another example, the average salary at McDonald's here is >INR 2500 an hour or an annual salary of around 50 lacs. Dude thought he was living in UP 😂 I have no idea why tf are you listing all this in INR Atleast the bank is legit, unlike Byjus with their scammy tactics in the past. Because he is trying to give some perspective in /r/india? The original comment itself was talking in INR so switching currencies will only make it confusing Elites in India can do whatever the fuck they want and get out or consequences with an essay at most, the length of the essay would be inversely proportional to their net worth. They were also involved in Bofors. And later in cash-for-passport scandal in UK: Their citizenship application was initially denied in 1990. Subsequently they lobbied and donated money to Labour under Tony Blair and were granted British citizenship around 2000. Hard to say. Someone has a hard-on for them because they had reached an out of court settlement with those employees, yet prosecution decided to proceed and judge chose to convict. Given how high profile they are, this doesn't happen without political nudge. > instead of buckling to Money and political power It is quite possible that their crimes are being punished *because* of political reasons. They reached a settlement with the victims before trial. The prosecution still chose to proceed and they still managed to get convicted. High profile people like them don't get punished like this unless someone is out to them. Sorry I am being cynical but this is what I have always seen. > as a person residing in Switzerland, my rent for a room in a five person flat is ~INR 75000 Hindusja's lawyer claimed that compensation included board/lodging provided by the employer. Not taking away from the crime and the visa shenanigans, only addressing the 'rental' part of your comment. > Their conviction springs from a case that began in 2018 when, following a tipoff, Swiss prosecutors raided the villa as well as the offices of Hinduja Bank and other local businesses that belong to the sprawling Hinduja Group, taking documents relating to the Swiss Hinduja family’s accounts and hard drives. Generational criminals You mean the same Swiss who built their economy out of Nazi Gold made out of the teeth of industrially murdered Jews? Those Swiss? “wHiTE peOplE tReaT uS IndiAnS sO bAd” 🤡 If you dig up old records, literally each nation or ruler will have a dark past. What matters is how they are now. I understand. I just wanted to point out the cost of living here in general and how if you are paid a pittance, you have little power to step away from your enslaver to be able to live out on your own, seek legal counsel or go back home. Totally agree with you. Because this is r/india and not many people are familiar with the CHF to INR conversion rate nor the cost of living here? Also, I was replying to the original comment, which mentioned the payment in INR. Exactly! Thank you! Okay. The same Switzerland that refuses to take a stand against Russia and still claims neutrality like it did for the Nazis? Billionaires, but they stink of human trash. Repulsive 👎 Dude neutrality has its place too. When you have two countries going at it either one will not be willing to have any sort of mediator who is allied with their one enemy. If the swiss took Russia's side it would ruin their ties with Ukraine and vice versa. I don't always agree with staying neutral especially when it's clear whose the bad guy but there's definitely some sense to it. Also sometimes countries don't want to be involved in others problems. Sure buddy You can never take India out of Indian. Throw the keys away, please They too. Including the NRIs. It was alleged that workers who came to build the largest Temple outside India in New Jersey were underpaid and made to work long hours. None of them have ever been Indian. Republic of India came into existence in 1947. Unless you believe the whole \"Akhand Bharar\" shtick. Indian caste system in operation. Next time someone talks about how the educated elite no longer follow caste system, show these to them. This kind of legal proceedings and judgement is the only reason these NRIs miss India. Isn't there any judge to order a **one-page essay** on the topic 'dealing with domestic workers'? On the other hand indian law considers writing 300 word essay as a punishment for hit and run murder It's fuck all money even if they pay them as per swiss rules but they still chose to pay nothing and treat them as slaves. Classic Indian mentality, always treating servants and maids as low class and not worth the money they pay for. Many Indian diplomats have been caught before doing the same in other countries but escaped with immunity. > \"Our clients have been acquitted of all human trafficking charges. We are appalled and disappointed by the rest of the decision made in this court of first instance, and we have of course filed an appeal to the higher court thereby making this part of the judgement not effective,\" reads the statement signed by lawyers Yael Hayat and Robert Assael and Roman Jordan. There's still work remaining. Who is representing the workers? How can we help them? How law should be! Probably brother rivalry. With each brother looking to take the biggest piece of the pie, it wont be of surprise if one of the brother is behind the push for prosecution. I think they were legally Indian citizens from partition up until the late 90s/early 00s, when they acquired British (Srichand, Gopichand, Ashok) and Swiss (Prakash) citizenship. And they say that UK doesn't offer Golden Passports... >They reached a settlement with the victims before trial. The prosecution still chose to proceed and they still managed to get convicted. I'm not very familiar with the Swiss legal system. However, your comment makes it seem as if the following occurred: 1. The victims filed a legal action against members of the Hinduja family in a **civil court** (or out of court); and 2. The Swiss prosecutors continued to press a separate legal action against members of the Hinduja family in a **criminal court**. Again, I'm not very familiar with the Swiss legal system. But, here in the United States, the defendant in a criminal complaint cannot evade or negate prosecution by reaching an out-of-court settlement with the victim. This is because the *victim* is not the *plaintiff*. Instead, the plaintiff is the government entity charged with enforcing whichever rules the defendant allegedly violated. So far as I'm aware, there are cases in which a victim's decision to forgive or \"settle\" with the defendant might prompt the prosecutors to drop their claim. The same holds true if the victim insists that, for whatever reason, charges not be pressed or pursued. But the prosecutor can still make an independent decision, because writing the law--and enforcing its provisions--is not the responsibility of the victim, but the responsibility of the state. In a situation like this, I can understand why the Swiss government might elect to overlook the provisions of a civil or out-of-court settlement. If the Swiss government did not prosecute, it would be sending a message: \"if you have money, we will overlook labor and trafficking violations so long as you make amends with the victim whensoever such violations are discovered.\" >High profile people like them don't get punished like this unless someone is out to get them. Sorry I am being cynical but this is what I have always seen. I do agree with you here. Simply being sentenced to prison for a length of time does not mean that the convicted person(s) will actually serve their entire sentence behind bars. Depending on how Swiss law is structured, the sentence could be commuted, or the convicted person could reach some sort of agreement to serve their remaining sentence in or under house arrest. The most serious of the charges, human trafficking, against them were completely dismissed by the court on Friday, Yes kanoon andha hai > The victims filed a legal action against members of the Hinduja family in a civil court (or out of court) No, I posted an article in the thread which says they received a tip off and raided. They decided to prosecute, Hindujas settled with the victim, prosecutor decided to still proceed with prosecution. > But the prosecutor can still make an independent decision, because writing the law--and enforcing its provisions--is not the responsibility of the victim, but the responsibility of the state. Yes definitely, but I looked up the prosecutor and he has dropped other high profile criminal cases when initially he was very certain about criminality. Generally prosecutors work within a system and when really big fish get fried there are other people who want it done. I am sure there was lobbying effort by Hindujas. So why did they fail? They are not some random rich businessmen. They are super connected. After the settlement, it would have been easy to drop the case. So what's the motivating factor? Is there election in the country this year? No. Is the prosecutor wanting to enter into politics or wanting? Couldn't find anything....you know like Preet Bharara whose cases later unravelled and there was evidence of a certain bias in prosecution? This prosecutor could very well be a very honest and upright man, but generally system doesn't allow people to reach these positions. As I said, sorry for being cynical. Weren't they volunteers? Company scrip is no excuse - which these food and lodgings effectively are. Fuck these people. >No, I posted an article in the thread which says they received a tip off and raided. They decided to prosecute, Hindujas settled with the victim, prosecutor decided to still proceed with prosecution. Thanks for sharing an additional resource. >They decided to prosecute, Hindujas settled with the victim, prosecutor decided to still proceed with prosecution. I read the article that you posted. So far as I can tell--and please do correct me if I'm wrong--the settlement was reached with the victims during the actual course of the trial. Again, I don't know much about the Swiss judiciary, but it typically takes some time for charges to be filed and for a case to proceed to trial. Your article indicates that the \"case\" stems from an investigation that was opened in 2018, yet a settlement was only reached and announced during the trial. If I were the prosecutor or the judge, I would find the timing at least somewhat suspect. >Yes definitely, but I looked up the prosecutor and he has dropped other high profile criminal cases when initially he was very certain about criminality. I don't know what decision-making process the prosecutor has employed, either now or in the past, but your article states that the judge explicitly referred to the civil sentence when imposing and lowering the defendants' fines and fees. So the provisions of the settlement were considered in sentencing--if not by the prosecutor, then by the judge. >This prosecutor could very well be a very honest and upright man, but generally system doesn't allow people to reach these positions. As I said, sorry for being cynical. Maybe you're right (or maybe you're not). If members of this family broke the law, then they are--at the very least--being held accountable. I wouldn't lament political motivations if it ensures that a pack of wealthy cunts are held liable for a gross abuse of labor. Also, so far as accountability goes: none of the defendants bothered to attend the initial judgment hearing, citing the \"ill health\" of elder relatives. They aren't even present in the country where they've bee sentenced. Human trafficking is kidnapping buddy, they consented to come and later were exploited. > If members of this family broke the law, then they are--at the very least--being held accountable. I wouldn't lament political motivations Not lamenting at all. Just curious. > Company scrip is no excuse That's what I said. Meanwhile a millionaires son runs over and kills 2 people in front of witnesses and gets granted bail in no time with a circus going on in the family to shift blame. That is our system for you. Ik but these were some of charges which were later dropped stating that the workers signed some papers which they didn't know, as per their spokesperson. Hmm what?? Switzerland has already sanctioned Russia. What else do you want? Them to send Swiss soldiers to Ukraine and fight? Yeah as a counsel for the plaintiff you want maximum punishment so a barrage of sections are applied,sometimes they make sense sometimes they don’t. It’s Swiss Courts, they have logic, so does Indian Courts but politicians and rich people can armtwist people here. Laws like these in India when?? >The same Switzerland that refuses to take a stand against Russia Those are political decisions dumbass and those decisions are made by taking many foreign relation aspects into consideration. Those foreign policies have nothing to do with how a common person is treated on Swiss soil and their human rights on Swiss soil. They had money to pay the worker fairly. So it is now clear they did they from pure evilness. If only India had labor laws Well said, my liege! I wonder why this comment is down voted so much! That is just CEO & shartkank motivation... #startups #entreprenuer Excellent.I wish this would happen in India but money and status buys you freedom from any punishment. Respect to Switzerland court. It's showcasing law is equal for every individual irrespective on their income level.🙏🏻 another example of, money cannot buy class. enjoy your jail time wannabe slave drivers. Genuinely, so sarcasm or anything, I genuinely want to know why would a family worth 40bn dollars not give fair wage to their house help? There's just 4 of them. I would maybe understand not paying factory workers fairly bc there are tons of them and they want to make more profits (not good obvv but can make sense) but why 4 house workers? What was the thinking behind it really? Greed expanding to evil levels. Squeeze and suck the poor dry of his life even if it benefits 0.0000001% monetarily. otherwise america wont give them visa. casteist beliefs. Probably thought the system there is very similar to India"
