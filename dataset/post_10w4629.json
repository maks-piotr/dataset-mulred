        "The concept is flawed, because it is incredibly easy for young women to find a partner if they want to, so they won't register for something like this unless they get paid or are desperate for some reason. \n\nIt's the same problem as with the paid matchmaking services for middle aged and older women: the majority of men in that age group don't need to pay to meet someone willing to date them, so the few that sign up are bound to have 'something wrong' with them, and the women will end up disappointed and waste money and time.",

I will rephrase if something sounds like that.\n\nThanks. Hoping for a constructive feedback.",

        "Do you even comprehend the percentage of people who fall under LGBTQ category against the total human population? That my dear friend no matter how you want to twist people's words,  is what's meant by negligible. \nAlso, i have a simple philosophy wherein a cow should be called a cow even if it feels bad thinking that it identifies itself as a fish or a bird.",
        "The reason is hotel where the event held had high concentration mallus / afghan bachelors living in singles accommodation so maybe coz of proximity. Organizer was smart he knew that if hold a event in area where there are lot of bachelors living in hostels the turn out would be high ‚Ä¶cheaper hotels and high turnout innit so they can make profit",
        "I don't think they should be described as 'desperate' just because they're looking for a partner. There are a lot of middle aged women that are financially secure and single, and they are often looking for a partner close to them in age that is on a similar income level and presentable etc. \n\nThe problem is, presentable looking middle aged men who are educated and well to do have many women to choose from, so they're extremely unlikely to pay to use a matchmaking service. Some women pay, then they feel scammed by the agency.",
        "Okay.\n\nYour (absurd ) analogy is for trans people. \n\nWhat about sexuality? Your views on gay and lesbians? As the event is for hetero couples only and I called out that only.\n\nPlease stick to one point.\n\nStill you haven't pointed out a line which says \"sexuality is my personality\" shows the shallowness of your arguments.",
        "Shallowness of argument? The whole fuss you've made (and make over every random thing) is about sexuality. \n\nBy all means, go like anyone you want male/female whoever you want, but stop trying to change the rest of the people's beliefs/lifestyle just because YOU wish so. That's all.",
        "I talked about homosexual relationships and not gender identity.\n\nThe event does not have any option for gay/lesbians.",
        "They made a heterosexual event, it's MEANT for heterosexuals, not for you to call them out. You wish a similar event, GO to an LGBTQ specific event..?",
        "Because they didn't intend to make one so?  Join/Organise an LGBTQ event , rather than feeling so priveleged to be sitting in your room and name calling and deciding how companies (who have zero relation to you) should be operating. Again, to be clear to you if you still didn't get it, I have nothing against your choice of lifestyle, I'm pointing out the poor reaction you publically make over something unrelated to you.",
        "I hear you. I used the word 'desperate' only because you used that word. I agree. No one needs to be desperate. If there is a genuine need for companionship, there shouldn't be a problem seeking it, whether you are a man or woman. Women shouldn't have to feel that seeking companionship is improper.",
