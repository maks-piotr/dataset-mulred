        "It is different here. The UK has had a stagnant gdp since 15 years and an aging population kept afloat by foreign workers. Even the firms in the UK havent seen extreme gains in profits in last 15 years exceot during the covid wealth transfer. India has however grown 250% in last 15 years. However wages have declined by 10- 50% in white collar jobs after adjusted for inflation and tax. The blue collar jobs were dependent on govt handouts 15 years back but now earn more than white collar folks and are eating their tax money. The corporate orgs are refusing to pay inflation linked wages because they need to keep investors and political parties happy. The education sector never decreases their costs to keep real estate sector happy. Overall common man who pays taxes is bring silently killed in Indua by providing 4th eotkd services after looting his money.",
        "The private sector has its own agenda. Issue is how the government is so fully reliant on the private sector to create jobs and put money in the hands of the working class. Ainâ€™t happening. This is in direct conflict with the private sectorâ€™s goal of profit maximisation. The day we all realise this and vote for a government that will take responsibility will be the day we change for the better."
