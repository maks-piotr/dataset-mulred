Look at this thread, anyone questioning the validity of this study is downvoted oblivion. Nobody has any interest in questioning the government, they are just cheering their respective sides. The government isn't naive the people are, the government knows this. Says the guys quoting a dudious study from a government finance institute, but doesn't have intellectual bandwith to engage anyone questioning the study only to name-call them. You fullfill all criteria of r/UsernameChecksOut far far better. I believe the free bus rides will positively impact employment of women. But any fudged survey, is likely to be questioned. I am sure some newspaper will analyse this. It’s fitting data into the gaping hole, not a “study”. That was only the presumption for the quantification of the impact. It looks like the data collected (however good or bad) was able to indicate that the there is an increased labor force participation rate. And even if we don’t assume that the money saved is not being spent, it would still increase the social security of the women involved. Public transportation exists make commuting cheaper. Not make a profit All the study shows that when poor people get the money, they spend it. They spend it because they don't have enough. The concept of opportunity cost of money needs to be kept in mind whenever we are talking about government expenditure. I am sure it would benefit some women, but the massive amount of expenditure on this could have been better spent on lots of thing which produce more tangential results. [Laws that limit women’s employment in India | IDR (idronline.org)](https://idronline.org/article/gender/laws-that-limit-womens-employment-in-india/) Indian labor laws are biased against women and there are plenty of prohibitions from employing women at late hours, these prohibitions exist because of an endemic sexual assault problem in our society which while long term needs revisiting of education but at short and medium terms have to be addressed by heavy police presence. Indian states including karnataka have very low police to population ratio, karnataka has a serious shortfall, [Twofold problem of vacancies and low ratio to population - The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/twofold-problem-of-vacancies-and-low-ration-to-population/article66571699.ece#:~:text=The%20police%20population%20ratio%20is,per%20lakh%20of%20the%20population.). This money that's going to be making every women travel for free could have been better spent on making sure that women who have to travel, can travel freely and unmolested. > This money that's going to be making every women travel for free could have been better spent on making sure that women who have to travel, can travel freely and unmolested How? Put a cop in every bus? I think hiring private security guards in buses, if that will help. But I do see the bigger point. But, can we wait for perfect conditions to happen, before free rides for women? I say, start something, measure, improve/change as situation demands. >How? Put a cop in every bus? I think hiring private security guards in buses, if that will help. Get the Cop to population ratio to 250 to every 100,000, as the UN recommends and it might not sound so impossible to execute. That being said, regular patrolling and a heavy presence of police such that they are visibly there in a reliable manner, can work wonders >But I do see the bigger point. But, can we wait for perfect conditions to happen, before free rides for women? I say look at east asia, these countries be it Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Now China and Vietnam have pulled most people out of poverty in shortest amount of time and for the most part they didn't fall to populist schemes rather by India standards they were blatantly capatalist. [Govt plans to build dormitories near manufacturing clusters so workers don't leave | Today News (livemint.com)](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-plans-to-build-dormitories-near-manufacturing-clusters-so-workers-dont-leave-11716893177341.html) Above plan needs to be followed through, you won't need free bus rides if women are housed next to factory. Such scenes are common in China. How costly is the bus ride that they give up their jobs due to the bus costs? Even if it is 50rs per day, it leads to 1500 rs per month. Which means their salaries must not be more than 4000rs if they are willing to leave their jobs instead of paying bus tickets. I too was pleasantly surprised by the huge workforce of women in HK/China when I visited first. I agree on dorms near manufacturing clusters(China style). Awesome achievement. Again, as I said, do we wait for clusters and dorms to happen? I vote for free rides now, and once the situation improves, changing it as needed. > How? Put a cop in every bus? I think hiring private security guards in buses, if that will help. Doesn't conductor already cover private security position? Yes. But may be an extra hand for a ladies only bus, IF security is a concern in women’s labour participation. But I think free rides are a good idea for now, till we have dorms in place. While idea is good, the govt needs to be funding it without trying to make shortfall from others. And, funding needs to increase to improve public transport and not just let it ruin under increased load. > But I think free rides are a good idea for now, till we have dorms in place. The main thing blocking women is families, then safety to live. It really depends on the society adapting really. Though, overall ridership numbers for bus services in Karnataka are lower than they were in 2017-18, just above with this growth to 2018-19 numbers. Which is mostly due to govt not improving last mile connectivity. > But may be an extra hand for a ladies only bus, IF security is a concern in women’s labour participation. There is a plan to introduce ladies only buses. Overall, the Shakti scheme's success in Karnataka reflects a progressive approach towards women's empowerment, economic growth, and social inclusion, setting a positive example for other regions to follow. Let us hope things improve. Industrialization is one sure way to lift the masses out of poverty. Not against this scheme, but this is a modest return. The word \"presumably\" tells the story in full. It may have happened. Shakti scheme costs the state exchequer 5000 crores a year or \\~420 crores a month. The bump in GST translates to \\~34 crores a month, or 10 times less. The scheme should continue. It has helped lakhs of women across the state. But, let's not quantify it in this manner. It's unnecessary and goes against the stated goal of the scheme. Can't put a monetary value on the freedom it brings. The labour study still holds up. LFPR and WPR rose by quite a bit in the quarter when this scheme was implemented. If more people join the workforce, expenditure, and thus GST collections rise. Unless they’re stashing all the money they earn under their pillows. This shows trickle up economics work better than trickle down. More power to the Karnataka govt. Glad they did a study to show how welfare schemes affect the economy in a positive way. Oops, too much truth... The cost of Freebies is paid in the future. The state wil come to regret that just as West Bengal is finding out now. Infrastructure development and maintenance has come to grinding halt here. So sad. Not against free bus rides .. it's better than disasters like old pension scheme... But state government must fully subsidise the loss inccured by KSRTC and make sure that the ride quality (Bus condition, maintanence, frequency, rush in buses) don't suffer due to these freebies But oh wait, Gand me goo nahi hain aur suaro ko dawat Dene chale... Government doesn't back KSRTC and then people who actually needed the bus are now relying on private players for transportation.. Overall, a failed concept! Also, Loss inccured by KSRTC is more than 320 odd crore of GST collection by improved employment.. Also, now that the women are actually earning, can't they afford the bus fare? Public transport should be as accessible and as affordable as possible. This scheme should be implemented nationwide. We need more & more women to join the workforce. Boys & girls. The key point here is not the increase in GST collection. *It is the increase in women labour force participation* [India starts survey to assess women participation in workforce - The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-starts-survey-to-assess-women-participation-in-workforce/article67793871.ece#:~:text=Latest%20PLFS%20data,23%2C%20it%20was%2037%25.) The women's labour force participation rate has been increasing since 2017, across India. Credit goes to modi !, might as well because correlation is causation without any proof. [Press Information Bureau (pib.gov.in)](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1805783), A dozen states have better WLFR than Karnataka without any free bus service.

WLFR has been in an increasing trend since 2017-18, Might as well credit mudi ji for it if we are going to make disparate connection without any proof. [Press Information Bureau (pib.gov.in)](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1805783), A dozen states have better WLFR without price tag of 5000 crores per annum. >The scheme should continue. It has helped lakhs of women across the state. But, let's not quantify it in this manner Quantification when done honestly could and should open eyes, and help conclude whether it's a failure or a success. And the conclusion is the scheme is a failure. [Press Information Bureau (pib.gov.in)](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1805783) A dozen states have better WLFR rates than Karnataka without 5000 per annum crore price tag. It's very difficult to pull back subsidies once given, barring a major financial crisis they won't. Punjab and Kerala are tittering on verge of bankruptcy but can't really fathom to pull back on free electricity or pension they are doling out. And you did correlate all the data from your armchair at your house right? So the cost of the scheme is 5000 cr, GST revenue is 300 cr. So the taxpayer bears the burden of 4700 cr with interest. This seems like a silly proposition as a tax payer. Leaving aside the intangible benefits, Karnataka spent 4-5 thousand crores on the scheme and that added 300-400 crore to GST. Is that a good ROI? I hope that it doesn't go amiss that the study was done by state sponsored Fiscal Policy Institute (FPI). :/ looksl ike a good investment opportunity: 310 cr annual return on 4381 cr annual expense > And the conclusion is the scheme is a failure. Who declared this? The link I have posted shows WLFP participation rate in 2019-20 in Karnataka as 31.7%, it has declined to 28.7% as per the \"report\". 31.7% > 28.7% Oh and you got 31.7% without 5000 crore per annum expenditure. Not my fault that I am a better analyst than folks at fiscal policy institute of Karnataka. Although I do think its because I am not bound to show failing schemes as successful. Please walk us through your process of your analysis? [Press Information Bureau (pib.gov.in)](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1805783) The above link shows WLFPR for karnataka in 2019-20 at 31.7% which is greater than 28.7% it currently has as per the \"report\" and oh that is without a 5000 crore per annum price tag. Also to note how WLFR has been surging across India since 2017, [Press Information Bureau (pib.gov.in)](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1967291). If anything Karnataka has been in decline relative to rest of India stats. You make lot of assumptions sitting at your home! Firstafaaal, you don't have complete data! You have no idea/data what happened during covid and its aftermath. You make blind deductions and act all smart. I can highlight all your mistakes(rookie assumptions) but that'll not make you learn anything. I have seen this effect on some labourers, who get free ration everywhere, and some sort of cash transfer to ladies etc. Then they do not want to work everyday. Once they run out of money, they will go work for couple of days in a week. So, factories who depend on a steady stream of labourers are stuck with inadequate manpower. While there will always be leeches in the system, I think still free rides can help kickstart local economies. May be keep the free rides for a couple of years? > Anyone who doesn't declare this scheme a failure is either illiterate or a congress toadie. In that case I am an illiterate. But seriously, what is the consensus or what did the experts say?"
