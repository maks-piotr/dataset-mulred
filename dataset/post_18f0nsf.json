        "Most people in this sub know very little about economy . Lemme explain \n\nMost states in South India depend on alcohol tax for revenue. It funds a lot of consumption taxes which States charge . Essentially they have officers to keep track of the supply so that there is no revenue shortfall. But because it's difficult to find government employees who are ready to do the third shift, government has decided to stop third shift. \n\n\nOtherwise scummy alcohol companies can fiddle with stats by producing more in shifts where officials are not likely to be present. Essentially Karnataka government is protecting its revenue source . I don't see anything wrong with this. Alcohol is not price sensitive to that extent. They can produce the same quantity in two shifts . My opinion is that all breweries were scamming the govt",
        "If all the breweries were scamming the govt, I think that'd be a great incentive for the govt to go after the breweries for the lost revenue. Since alcohol is still looked down upon by society in general, there would not be much blow back from it also.\nIMO, finding officers for the 3rd shift can be achieved by offering higher wages/compensation and since this would bring in more revenue, should not be difficult to get the wages approved. \nAlso, brewery capacity expansion is capital intensive and the machinery and brewery tanks are crazy expensive (source: dad worked in engg firms which produce these) so don't think alco producers can easily produce 150% the quantity they are currently set up for\n\nEdit: missed a word",
        ">My opinion is that all breweries were scamming the govt\n\nIsn't it weird that you operate with the presumption that the companies *must* be doing something bad even when it's the government failing to do its job? Employees will lose jobs, companies will lose revenue, and they will be forced to curtail production because the government first insisted that they have a nanny sitting at production doing nothing but supervising them, and then they can't find enough nannies?\n\nInstead of punishing the companies, why don't they pay their excise supervisors more for doing third shifts? The government simply doesn't want to do its work so someone else should suffer for it rather than the government fix itself?",
