All I can say is this would be allowed here because they say: Contains jowar and they clearly mention the ingredients in decreasing order of the %. \n\nIt is your mums fault in this case, but unlike most consumers she has realized and this is what is needed: Informed consumers. \n\nYou responded to the top comment here saying this is false advertising. It is not. They did not say \"it is made with millets\" as you claim, they say \"contains jowar\". There is a huge difference with made with and contains. If you look at various food items you may find them mentioning that the product may contain xyz (allergens) because they are produced in the same factory environment. Contains does not mean it is a big percentage and unfortunately even with tougher regulations this would pass without a need for change in the wording.\n\nDo not get me wrong, I totally agree that this is an immoral thing to do. But even with stringent laws this will not change unless you add a clause about how much percentage of something is needed before someone can claim it contains xyz. But in this case companies will not need to mention possible trace allergens.",
        "food is regulated, that's why it says \"contains Jowar\" and not made from it. they're also bound to show exactly how much on the packaging.\n\nIt is deceptive practice, but considering the strictest countries in the US also suffers from this same issue, it's something that more regulation cannot fix, perhaps better and different regulations like Mexico, that banned cartoons from being depicted on high sugar foods.",

        "While this might be an OP problem since regulation stops a product from outright lying and is the reason the product used the word \"**Contains**\" Jowar; but lets not kid ourselves of good food regulation in India. Companies can just label a product ayurvedic and obfuscate all ingredients as \"special propriety ayurvedic mixture\" thereby bypassing any checks for lead, mercury or any harmful substance. Herbal shampoos similarly hide ethyl lauryl sulphate under \"propriety herbal mixture\".

Each word variation in the above three have certain distinct meaning. \n\nI know this for a fact in the petfoods I buy. They will use the wording **contains** chicken **matter**. Going through global regulation standards, the matter imply the chicken is of reject parts like kidneys and livers. The **contains** is regulated for use when specific ingredient is 5-15% or 5-25%. If **with** was used instead of **contains** it indicates 15-40% or 25-40% and so on I forget the rest.",

        "Hey! Professional baker here.\n\nAllow me to clarify why this is normal and actually better for you (relatively) \n\nFact 1. Maida isn't the devil and isn't unhealthy. It's actually the lowest caloric flour with a lot of protein (gliadin and glutenin). The problem here is it has very little fiber and micronutrients, as it's processed to provide us with the best texture. Even the fats are filtered out, the healthy fats. \n\n\nFact 2. Maida is the backbone of most baked goods that taste good. You may say no that's false but again, baked goods are based on preference and most people prefer a light crunchy biscuit, neither of which can be achieved without maida. Actually. The rule of thumb usually is only 10-33% of the flour weight Can be substituted with whole grain flour. Maida is just aata that has been stripped off.\n\nFact 3. Bakers calculator works like this.\n\nFlour is considered 100% and all other ingredients like butter sugar salt etc are a percentage of the flour weight.\n\nAnd then the ingredients you see, are given based off of total biscuit. As in 5% of this BISCUIT is jowar. What it does is this, the amount of nutrition stripped off of aata to make maida, is added back by heavy grains like jowar, wheat bran, and fiber. That is them making up for what is lost with maida. You get best of both worlds like this.\n\nThis is so exciting for bakers because we are now able to directly calculate what needs to be added in what amount without compromising taste and texture. \n\nTrust me, you won't like 100% jowar biscuits. And if you actually do wanna try!! (Next point)\n\n\nFact 4. If you actually want something healthier or customised to your choice, go to a local baker and ask them for a request. A small bakery will not only do exactly what you want, they (we) will actually be elated to have received a challenge like this. A lot of them (us) are out there just enjoying the challenges baking provides.\n\nReach out to your local bakers. PAY THE PREMIUM AS WE DONT BUY BULK INGREDIENTS. And enjoy exactly what you ask for.\n\nHell we use the same ingredients you'd use at your home by the same brand. \n\nJust my 2 dollars on this, since I've spent the last 4-5 years perfecting my own understanding of everything it takes to be a baker. \n\nShit isn't easy. You have to pay a premium to enjoy exactly what you want.\n\nThat's why I started baking to begin with. Lol",

Which makes sense to me.\nSo, using palm oil in place of other oils is better for environment.\n\nAbout exploitation of humans, we as Indians can't say that working conditions are bad, because in India's farming and manufacturing exploitation has been normalized, so we are already consuming many many products made by exploiting people.

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Poor mom thought these were healthier as it is advertised as made with jowar and millets but has only 5% of jowar (sourgham) flour :/ and is mostly maida and sugar. Way too scammy . Such marketing should be stopped.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Refined palm oil means wtf ? Cholesterol bomb :/ And also artificial flavors just cheeee Says clearly, \"contains\" and also gives the %. Don't see what's wrong in it. Kinda like, I have been sober for 1 year but was a drunker for 30 years. ( don't know if the example is good with it) Oh right! Im reminded of atta maggi. Though tbh at least they are required to make disclosures. From our side we have to be proactive, read the ingredients and make good choices for our own health. Consumers needs to be more vigilant. You can't complain against them because they have not written any lies, just designed it so that product appears healthy while it's not. Buy Britannia digestive it has 0 percent maida written on it This is exactly how the marketing people get away with it. Placing huge information and graphics of the healthy ingredient on the packet when they barely make the content. Its just an illusion. Yes. Reading the ingredient list is what caught my eye. But the general public often buys food which looks relatively healthy and comes at a better price. That is why i wish there were stricter laws for food and its marketing. This is exactly what grinds my gears. Sure they are right technically. But placing huge graphics and vitamins and fiber content and saying its made with millets when in reality its barely 5% is shady marketing. Cheeni maida tel. Recipe of obesity. True it's the same with brown bread. Ads are always misleading Noted If only you could turn the package over before purchasing it. Damn corporations! It's not only india bro, this shit has spread everywhere I did. But parents often miss it when they go monthly grocery shopping. They grab the ‚Äòhealthier‚Äô looking product, but I‚Äôm trying to make them read before buying. But still sucks that they are advertised in this way Worse than palm oil as it loses (some of) its antioxidant content. Bad for health and bad for the environment. Plus jowar doesn't have a statistically / medically significant amount of antioxidants. It's similar to most other grains. Few mg ¬± per unit serving isn't exactly \"RICH IN ...\" Even the \"LOWER GI\" claim is bogus from health/medical viewpoint. Damn you are right. My mom thought these biscuits were ok for eating in diabetes, but this is the exact opposite of what she should have! It is clearly mentioned 'contains' meaning Jowar is one of the ingredients . Also you cannot make biscuits of Jowar purely because it has a strong taste compared to wheat and does not have other properties of wheat like fine texture or sticky. That would make the biscuits brittle, hard and slightly bitter in taste. To yaar ye to normal baat hai, aapko kya lgta hai boost dhoni, aur Kohli ki energy ka secret hai kya, shakkar hai wo to Aur sb biscuits ke saath esa hi hai, esa hi mislead krte hai Bakery wgera se liya kro, ya online bhi mil jayenge lakin ho skta hai thode menhnge pde False advertisements are way too common now. Pan-masalas use similar tactics to advertise their illegal products. They have paved their ways through indian Laws, which should've been updated a long ago. all fried snacks in market are fried in palm oil. And maida 40%ü§£ü§£ü§£ i bought once sona chandi chyawanprash...but u know... Ain't surprised for a bit after seeing this post. 100% fruit juice with no sugar contains barely 9% of fruit extract and almost 95% of sugar solution. Big food chains like Dominos, KFC, McDonald's etc sells cancer in the name of food. you literally just have to flip the packet to see real contents. Yes very unhealthy 14.4g added sugar out of 15.6g total sugar. üíÄ Even if regulated nothing can be done here. It's written what's inside. It's just that most people don't read the fine print on the back of the pack and if you spend time and read, people will look at you weird. The front wrapper always uses targetted words and colours to sell and it works. Red to capture attention (using the keywords to sell), Pink for women's products/romance (look up pink tax), Green for healthy illusion, Blue for trust, Yellow for positivity, Gold for luxury. Black is to overwhelm the consumer with a bunch of text so people won't read into it (this is where they put all the ingredients and bad stuff). Next time before you buy anything just spend a minute reading the ingredients. Something similar I've noticed last day while buying groceries at Spencers, saw Spencers egg noodles, checked the ingredients list, says \"contains 4% egg\" in small letters lol there's not a single biscuit in the market that's even remotely healthy no matter what the labels say. stick to nuts if you want healthy snacks with chai. I don't see false advertisement in this case, they clearly mentioned the ingredients on the packet. They say \"contains jowar\" which is also true. \"Made with millets\" which is also true. Where is the false advertisement, its just clever marketing. And if people can't even take 1 second to flip the packet, I think its on them. And if someone tries to spread awareness regarding all these false marketing, they get legal notices from big companiesü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So the mom didn't want to be bothered to flip the package like people in any other country would do. This is also the same kind of behavior that creates this mess in the first place. Just flip the packaging, though in other parts of the world, like in the EU, they often put the percentage next to claims like this, if not always. It is regulated which is why it says contains jowar, and not made from jowar. Deceptive marketing at worst Indian government is only concerned about how much that can tax those biscuits Everything that is edible and is packaged has this... Food is heavily regulated in India. You realised that the product you purchased isn‚Äôt what it claims to be because of stringent regulations, which requires the full list of ingredients to be printed on every packaged food item. This is a you problem. Pay attention to the package next time. Don‚Äôt get carried away by flashy graphics and slick copy. There is no unhealthyness in palm oil, contrary to popular belief (provably arose from the idea that cheap=bad). Yes, it don't have any benefits, but no harm too. It don't have any trans fats, it's almost completely saturated fat, which is good for cooking at high temperatures because MUFA and PUFA are not stable enough for high temperature cooking. I mean they did put the info on the back. I don't know where you live but a lot of independent producers these days make proper millet biscuits and other products. It‚Äôs not the jowar you need to rant about. It‚Äôs the 10s of artificial emulsifiers and stabilizers and flavoring agents that need to be regulated. All the additives are the main reason why we have severe metabolic dysfunction in our population. Most packaged food is utter garbage. The ingredients are written as in descending order in terms of quantity. Tag @foodpramer on instagram or twitter. Health Sutra Ragi High Digestive Biscuits, 320g (Vanilla) Try this, 36% ragi flour, 24% whole wheat flour Brown bread just means colour is brown. If you want healthier bread, you need to look for whole wheat bread which won't have maida This packaging would also be completely fine in other countries. That Revant Himatsingka aka Foodpharmer guy also does a great job about exposing such ‚Äúcreative marketing‚Äù by these companies. It's just how kwality walls sells vegetable fat as ice cream ü§° That's marketing for you Bruh everything has palm oil in it. It's more bad for the environment than for health. Always read the label when buying anything. Forget about jowar or maida or rajma. Look at the carb content on the table. That‚Äôs way too high. Means clogged arteries Atleast be thankful for that 5%. Its safe to say that those are one of the healthiest biscuits available in india. So what do you expect, noodles made out of eggs 100%? Egg noodles means they contain eggs (unlike most noodles). most biscuits in supermarket shelves are maida stuff no matter how they are advertised if u really want to know what stuff goes in the products then go to your local bakery they dont have cheap stuff like a packet of 8 biscuit costs rs60 but thy are healthy and more hygenic and quality control is better Exactly. People buy biscuits and expect it to be healthy lol It's Simple, just ignore front of every packaged food. Look and read the back side of pack and then make your decision. Tell your mother that just like she purchase vegetables looking at every piece, she should spend same time reading back side of food packet. Exactly, I'd like to see OPs face after trying 100% jowar biscuits lol. If you want to eat healthy food, don't eat biscuits. It means this is the first time you read the ingredients list of any packaged food. Yes because it's biscuits lol. Don't want to eat carbs, don't eat biscuits. The majority of the people don't look at whats written at the back of any product before buying and these companies know and use this against us. There are low carb biscuits duh. Reason why I spend alot of time shopping reading the ingredient list. Meanwhile my husband selects items in jiffy and complains I'm a slow shopper It is regulated. Fssai has been doing great job. But it's the manufacturers who find ways to misrepresent things and sugar coat their products, inspite of the regulations. Advertising is such. Hello there, I live in Germany and the EU has some of the best if not the best food regulations in the world. All I can say is this would be allowed here because they say: Contains jowar and they clearly mention the ingredients in decreasing order of the %. It is your mums fault in this case, but unlike most consumers she has realized and this is what is needed: Informed consumers. You responded to the top comment here saying this is false advertising. It is not. They did not say \"it is made with millets\" as you claim, they say \"contains jowar\". There is a huge difference with made with and contains. If you look at various food items you may find them mentioning that the product may contain xyz (allergens) because they are produced in the same factory environment. Contains does not mean it is a big percentage and unfortunately even with tougher regulations this would pass without a need for change in the wording. Do not get me wrong, I totally agree that this is an immoral thing to do. But even with stringent laws this will not change unless you add a clause about how much percentage of something is needed before someone can claim it contains xyz. But in this case companies will not need to mention possible trace allergens. food is regulated, that's why it says \"contains Jowar\" and not made from it. they're also bound to show exactly how much on the packaging. It is deceptive practice, but considering the strictest countries in the US also suffers from this same issue, it's something that more regulation cannot fix, perhaps better and different regulations like Mexico, that banned cartoons from being depicted on high sugar foods. No but in biscuits i am shocked by palm oil Well they are not wrong, it does 'contain' jowar, even if 5%. Even Dettol never claims to kill 100 % of germs, how else will they sell their products. FMCG products works only on advertising! And the worst part is companies have taken the route to threaten YouTubers like FitTuber who expose their lies. So, you can‚Äôt even talk about it in a public forum without risking legal notice (which is of course bogus). Same as brown bread would have 32% Whole wheat and write Refined wheat floor or just wheat floor for maida. Always check for above 50% whole wheat floor and no refined or just wheat floor. This is happening around the world, unfortunately. Not just India And once the farm laws will be implemented...the whole game will be their its not that its not regulated; iirc, they are allowed to add anything in the front as it counts as graphical as long as they provide the right ingredients at the back. Ur se Try patanjali ü§£ü§£ Regulation can exist even the advertising and marketing side. It's not a you problem if the people aren't educated enough, the government isn't putting an effort to inform or teach the people. Always read terms and conditions before buying something... In this case read the ingredients. Nice The thing is Palm Oil is not bad and in fact, has some good qualities too. The problem is what is used in the market is Refined Palm Oil which is bad and also this refined Palm Oil is used for multiple sessions of frying, kept at high temp for loooong - all these make it extremely unhealthy. Ganda hai par dhandha hai Maida is banned in several countries. Refining actually make Palm oil better for frying. And palm oil being almost fully saturated makes it non affected when using it in long frying sessions. \"refined\" is vilified for no sensible reason around the world. Hopefully this helps - False and tricky advertising is not a you problem. They are misleading customers. Writing 100% Natural on the bottle and then saying it‚Äôs just a name and not a claim. This is pure evil. Check out Instagram page called foodpharmer‚Ä¶ he covers such false advertisings Just because it says 0% maida on the pack doesn‚Äôt mean it is 0. It has to be written in the ingredients list. Because in the back they write - It‚Äôs the name of the brand. Doesn‚Äôt mean it actually is 100% atta or juice or whatever. So false advertising isn‚Äôt to blame????? Also, not everyone is extremely educated. My mom doesn‚Äôt know how to read. What do you expect the general public to do? They rely on true advertising. Why are you trying so hard to absolve corporations of false advertising? Yeah we get that people are supposed to read everything before buying a toffee or biscuit because big corporations can get away with misleading information and marketing. This is atleast misleading but still no blatant lie. I bought Metro (by Kalory) brown bread recently and it explicitly stated being made of 100% Whole Wheat Flour on the front. In the ingredients, it is made entirely of Maida. Yes, not a single percent of whole wheat flour (atta) is mentioned. I filed a consumer complaint but no response Let's be honest, they clearly know what they're doing. I admit that it is tricky to enforce regulations as long as companies use leeway to exploit customers yeah, it is really sad as to what motivations drive these major corps. reflects the level of maturity of human society at large Which countries? idk why you'd be eating biscuits in diabetes at all though Well it doesnt say its made 100% of Jowar. They arent in the wrong, I always assume if they arent boasting about something being 100% of something, then most likely its a gimmick. The reason Palm oil is so competitively cheap in the market is mainly because it‚Äôs cultivated by exploitation of labourers. Secondly, such Palm plantations are detrimental to the environment. This [video](https://youtu.be/fgcfgTTuku0) about how Palm oil is found almost everywhere is worth a watch if you‚Äôre interested. I am just trying to say that consumers too have some responsibility to check what they are eating. If you are expecting the corporations to suddenly become good guys, you are dreaming. they just care about money. And its because of govt regulations that the corporations are forces to put correct ingredients on the package. So everyone is doing something to make this right. You can atleast flip the packet before buying. You should also know that these are digestive biscuits, meaning they have laxative in it, they will help you poop, you can check the table of contents for this, the ingredients are listed in the descending order of their amount, don't make a habit of eating these or there will come a time you won't be able to poop without them üòÜ This. They haven't lied to you. Everyone is well aware of how marketing works. The onus is on your before you buy. I‚Äôm one of those people who stands and reads the ingredients before buying. But not everyone can read English. General public? Literacy rates? Majority of our public won‚Äôt be able to read. Most of them are even not aware of these gimmicks. Our food regulations are good. But don‚Äôt you think there is should be regulations on misleading advertising? There is crime, there should be laws to combat that is all I‚Äôm saying. Recently Bournvita and a couple other brands had to update their packaging because an Instagrammer raised the issue. Had he not, it would keep on going. They are loaded with fat and carbs. If you are consuming a pack every now and then it's not a good choice either. It also uses Maltitol which has a GI value of 52 (60 for table sugar) affecting your blood glucose level and sweetener (955) sucralose which will make you crave more sugar. > Artificial sweeteners may play another trick, too. Research suggests that they may prevent us from associating sweetness with caloric intake. As a result, we may crave more sweets, tend to choose sweet food over nutritious food, and gain weight. If you want something healthy for regular use then look for Tots and Moms or Grandmaa Millets. It is not possible to make cookies, bread, bakery products and even roties without gluten. That is what holds the product. People who want to buy healthy food will never eat products if truly made without maida. People who want to eat healthy food will always prepare their food. mostly because its easiest and cheapest way. I've heard pure wheat flour biscuits will have way less shelf life. We want some disrupters in package food industry. There might be some local level players but nothing at big scale. And the worst part is it's in almost everything. Check the ingredients list between India and UK. You will know how much they can getaway with‚Ä¶ prime example - so called health drinks which is mostly sugar‚Ä¶ It clearly states that it contains Jowar. Isse zyaada regulate kya hoga. Made of jowar = made of jowar Contains jowar/ with jowar = has a wee bit of Jowar alongside the usual stuff. >Tots and Moms They sell mostly kids and baby food. Looks good tho Well they are not false. It does contain jowar, and so they wrote it. @foodpharmer on Instagram has been hammering brands for the past few months now. His work has gone viral and he has received multiple legal notices and threats from big brands. Another example is when brands say, \"made with 100% real tomatoes\" so you think the ketchup has 100% real tomatoes but no, they may have added just 1 or 2 tomatoes and they are real, the rest is all bs. At least they write 5% honestly if u see ayurvedic/homeo medicines/tonics/creams ingredients u'll go crazy they write only 5% ingredients god knows what other 95% it has and my mother believes them like anything | considering the strictest countries in the US EU, UK feels left out. Food laws of the US is one of the worst. She craves a lil treat here and there. She likes biscuits, tries to go for ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô options. Clearly after all the comments, of all the generic ones in the market almost none are on par with the diabetic requirements. Yeah.. putting an image of a bowl of jowar when it is actually majorly made of maida. Sounds right!! Snowflakes Maybe not false in this case.. but misleading due to images. Using technicalities ü§£ü§£ü§£ If you want healthy AND heavily processed food, you can pretty much guarantee not finding anything legit unless you're ready to pay up a sizeable amount. Even then it is better of the worse than something actually beneficial for your health. Came across an ad by Radhika Apte who was endorsing Olive oil consumption for healthy lifestyle. The product she was holding is called as Oleev active . Now we all know that Olive oil is pretty expensive so when I checked the price in big basket I was quite taken aback as to how 1litre of olive oil can cost mere 250 rupees or so. Then I scroll down and see this - 80% rice bran oil and 20% pomace oil. It's not even authentic olive oil! Misleading name, misleading ad! It says \"Contains Jowar\" not \"Made from Jowar\". This is only learning lesson for you mother to do not get minded by marketing. If anyone really wants to buy something healthy it can not be a proceed food most of the time. Also one require extensive research to determine if anything actually healthy or not. That is reason why marketing can get away with labeling any product as healthy even if it does nothing. Government is not just for the people (even though it ideally should prioritise) it's also for the corporates. Government can't micromanage these corporates. That's a beautiful nail polish. üíÖ Contains Jowar ‚â† Made completely with jowar. Legally you cannot do anything. This is on you. The 5% Jowar is what 'Contains Jowar' means. Don't have to bash the country for it. It will be the same for other countries. Foodpharmer's entire content now is full of exploiting people's fear about food for his own gain. He had reliable content when he was starting up and that's why people supported him but beyond a point when he ran out of genuine things to make content about, he just started fear mongering to gain followers. Stop following the likes of him. Who expects biscuits to improve health or a healthy option? Same goes a for a lot of \"brown breads\" out there. Consumers need to read the ingredients list, there is nothing wrong with the labeling or marketing here.It clearly says contains Jowar, it is already as per the regulations. Well, it does contain vitamins and fibers, they are not wrong and there is nothing shady at all. I came across his videos sometime back...I'm not on Instagram right now so can't say about the quality of content now. But it did give a quick insight into the kind of marketing that is being done. 100% real juice isn't even 50% real juice. 100% atta bread is not even 50% atta. These vids allowed me to find better alternatives and not rely on what's written in bold because that is always followed by a \\*. **I do not recommend following anyone religiously, just gain what you can from what little they have to offer.** Thumb rule: anything packed is not real, healthy. You want to eat and feel healthy ? Eat lots of fruits on empty stomach in the morning and lots of salads in between meals. Try this and see the difference in 3 weeks.... Unrefined oils are not suitable for deep frying. By refining, you remove all the nutrition and impurities that break down at low temperatures. Anything fried in unrefined oils will also go rancid within days. Ultimately, deep frying itself is bad, and it is best to limit the amount of deep-fried food in your diet. It gets way worse if your bhatura is deep-fried in reused black oil. Well, in all fairness, they said ‚ÄòContains Jawar‚Äô not Jawar biscuit. Yeah I concur on that. See followers like you are a minority who can differentiate the meaningful content. But majority of his followers are oblivious to his shamelessness Disagree. Look at certain european countries, they have nice regulation on marketing and labels. Yet those companies still make billions in revenue. Do not be brainwashed into thinking corporates HAVE to earn an extra buck by being (kinda) scammy. FSSAI be lackin Don't micromanage, that's why you have regulations. Also, corporates aren't living, breathing thinking entities with feelings, they exist to serve a purpose which is to make human life better. Anything that doesn't make everything better for humans should go away then. You people are confusing **hydrogenated** with **refined** in this thread. Hydrogenated palm oil is mostly saturated fat (~95%) -- which is what we used to call *dalda ghee*. This is refined palm oil, as opposed to pressed palm oil (which is red and has lower shelf life). It only has ~50% saturated fat and ~38% Oleic acid (MUFA). It is actually the *healthier* option for baking which otherwise would use hydrogenated vegetable fats (*dalda* or margarine) or clarified butter. Let the scammy ones die out. Nobody owes corporates anything, let alone a billion bucks. Do you know at what temperature biscuits/cookies are baked at? And do you know what high temperature does to antioxidants? If your biscuits have antioxidants, it's mostly for marketing. Lower GI. Lower to what? And what is the number, they dont say! This is how large-scale companies like parley Scam us!! I kind of feel we should be thankful to parley for even adding 5% jowar!! It does contain jowar. I'm glad they have to label it on the back. It's important for us as consumers to learn to read labels. I recommend watching videos by Fit Tuber, he does a good job with this. So they wrote down the exact percentage as per regulations. Advertised the correct hero ingredient, but you assumed it must be 100% millet biscuit, and that's the company's fault. Please tell me more about the non regulated, predatory practices of the company that gave you all the information that you chose to ignore. Jago ghrahak jago. Like literally. What's worse is they don't even check the ingredients to see if it's actually healthy. They read the word \"healthy for you\" and assume it must be.. says so on the packaging. This is on you though. Why not check ingredients before buying ? Tbh, works both way, we need to be aware as well. Look for safe languages, they played smartly with 'contains jowar', contains doesn't mean completely made of. Also, maida isn't evil, it's about moderation. Eating anything in excess will be harmful, be it maida or jowar. Maida isn't evil, neither is sugar (obviously if you're not diabetic). Instead of fearing the ingredient, and totally avoiding it, once should rather make an informed decision about moderation. Right!? Even chocobar's crust is mostly Refined Palmolein Oil, Sugar and again the oil in slightly different words with 0.9% cocoa powder. :( Tbf to biscuit manufacturers, it says contains Jowar. Not 100% Jowar. And at 5%, it is containing jowar. Tbf to biscuit manufacturers, it says contains Jowar. Not 100% Jowar. And at 5%, it is containing jowar. Fyi Pudin Hara capsules r made of gelatin ( which is made from cow/pig bones and tissue) and alot of religious hindu people take it everytime they have some stomach problem thinking it's ayurvedic ( it is but the coating...) While this might be an OP problem since regulation stops a product from outright lying and is the reason the product used the word \"**Contains**\" Jowar; but lets not kid ourselves of good food regulation in India. Companies can just label a product ayurvedic and obfuscate all ingredients as \"special propriety ayurvedic mixture\" thereby bypassing any checks for lead, mercury or any harmful substance. Herbal shampoos similarly hide ethyl lauryl sulphate under \"propriety herbal mixture\". Strictest regulations will exist only for core foods and medicine needed for survival, not biscuits or chawayprash or liv52. Source, my relatives and chem private teachers worked in BIS and FSSAI. True. I agree. Especially in a country like India where the population can be very easily swindled by media they consume, we should ideally have stricter laws than Europe. Unfortunately at least for this product I can say this sort of misleading is accepted in most countries, or rather it's not entirely misleading. Food regulations have rules on the usage of words on the front side, and this product specifically used the biscuits **contains** jowar, not **made with jowar** nor **made using jowar**. Each word variation in the above three have certain distinct meaning. I know this for a fact in the petfoods I buy. They will use the wording **contains** chicken **matter**. Going through global regulation standards, the matter imply the chicken is of reject parts like kidneys and livers. The **contains** is regulated for use when specific ingredient is 5-15% or 5-25%. If **with** was used instead of **contains** it indicates 15-40% or 25-40% and so on I forget the rest. Try sunfeast biscuit,they have more millets in them Parle thinks we are gawar!? This is pretty much legal in all countries. The regulation forces them to specify their ingredients in descending order on the packaging itself. If you care about the food product, flip the packet and read what it's made from. If you blindly trust any marketing, you're gonna have a bad time. There are little regulations on pictures but definitely stricter regulation on text wordings. Your garam masala packet might show bowls of turmeric, mirch, jeera powders or even roots/leaves but that won't imply those amounts of the ingredients will be present or their original forms. If pictures had regulations then coconut water would have had to stop showing pictures of coconut lest a dumb or litigation troll decided to claim there is no intact coconut lol Parle: kaisa laga mera mazaak ? üòã Yaha log compost bolke mitti bech rahe hai gardening market me, koi regulations nahi hai India me kuch bhi, maida and atta are from the same plant grain. Only difference is the gluten removal. All countries still use wheat with normal gluten levels aka maida. Only a handful of companies all around manufacture or serve gluten-free wheat aka atta and those carry the disclaimer they are gluten free Take it from me who see this in every petfood brand in the petfood industry, there is no strict regulations on pictures around the world but there absolutely is with the texts. In your case the moment I encountered the wording **contains** it automatically clicked the percentage would be ~5%. I don't have a good chart that lists what regulated words corresponds to what percentages, but consumers don't necessarily need to read the ingredient table here. Fittuber sold out almost 10years ago, he routinely shills for the same companies now. Hey! Professional baker here. Allow me to clarify why this is normal and actually better for you (relatively) Fact 1. Maida isn't the devil and isn't unhealthy. It's actually the lowest caloric flour with a lot of protein (gliadin and glutenin). The problem here is it has very little fiber and micronutrients, as it's processed to provide us with the best texture. Even the fats are filtered out, the healthy fats. Fact 2. Maida is the backbone of most baked goods that taste good. You may say no that's false but again, baked goods are based on preference and most people prefer a light crunchy biscuit, neither of which can be achieved without maida. Actually. The rule of thumb usually is only 10-33% of the flour weight Can be substituted with whole grain flour. Maida is just aata that has been stripped off. Fact 3. Bakers calculator works like this. Flour is considered 100% and all other ingredients like butter sugar salt etc are a percentage of the flour weight. And then the ingredients you see, are given based off of total biscuit. As in 5% of this BISCUIT is jowar. What it does is this, the amount of nutrition stripped off of aata to make maida, is added back by heavy grains like jowar, wheat bran, and fiber. That is them making up for what is lost with maida. You get best of both worlds like this. This is so exciting for bakers because we are now able to directly calculate what needs to be added in what amount without compromising taste and texture. Trust me, you won't like 100% jowar biscuits. And if you actually do wanna try!! (Next point) Fact 4. If you actually want something healthier or customised to your choice, go to a local baker and ask them for a request. A small bakery will not only do exactly what you want, they (we) will actually be elated to have received a challenge like this. A lot of them (us) are out there just enjoying the challenges baking provides. Reach out to your local bakers. PAY THE PREMIUM AS WE DONT BUY BULK INGREDIENTS. And enjoy exactly what you ask for. Hell we use the same ingredients you'd use at your home by the same brand. Just my 2 dollars on this, since I've spent the last 4-5 years perfecting my own understanding of everything it takes to be a baker. Shit isn't easy. You have to pay a premium to enjoy exactly what you want. That's why I started baking to begin with. Lol Hate that people can't read packaging properly. r/technicallythetruth Any recommendations for Millet biscuits, noodles or other products? This is the established status quo between regulatory agencies and producer-marketing for decades now and applies globally. What is bad is the government not making the customers aware of this aspect of wordings. It should be taught in schools so that people only needs to read the wordings and not the fineprint or ingredient tables. Had seen it before, the primary reason is still because of the obscene yield of palm oil, the exploitation part comes after because palm can only be cultivated in certain latitude range. Our govt wants to do the same shit now in Manipur with plans for palm oil cultivation. It does not have harm itself, but the demand enables the exploitation of people and loss of habitat of animals. Exactly. The problem here is that people are not taught in schools how to interpret texts in packaged products. The usage of **contains** or **with** has already become a standard globally for decades now. Do you also believe the X% off on all the products listed on Amazon. It is misleading only to an uninformed person, to the rest it's known as standard marketing. This isn't something new anymore, the usage of words like contains is globally accepted. It's not regulated properly anywhere. my man how the fuck am I agreeing with both of you I got to know today that Jawar is called Sorghum in English.. For a second I thought your nail broke from the middle... First things first...Nail design is amazing... secondary... should have read the package better When it comes to packaged products like chips and biscuits, it‚Äôs best to assume that literally almost none of them are good for us. So in general, limit those. Of course we love how it tastes, so we can‚Äôt cut them out altogether. At least I can‚Äôt. :D No brown/wheat bread can taste as good as white bread. Especially when it comes to something like French Toast. Contains jowar part is just gimmick by this brand, sadly many people are naive and fall for it. But almost every brand does it. You should read the ingredients list of almond milk. Lol. ‚Äú2% almonds.‚Äù so yeah. Homemade >>>> everything else. THIS! The only two things that should ever be trusted on any packaging are ingredient list and that nutritional info chart. Everything else is marketing. What is ??????????????? I love paneer on jowar! At this point I know if I want to eat healthyfrom outside, either I've to spend a shit load of money or just get the raw material at whole sale prices(I live on a farm, so it's easy) and make your own stuff that tastes good with the help of internet. The option of spending the same or little more money for a healthier alternative is always a shitty trap. PS. If you want to improve your parents/family's health. Start with a kitchen garden. Cant say enough about Morenga. It doesn't take much space and every family should have a tree. People in flates can grow it in a big pot(20-25 litre soil capacity). Next is forcing your parents to exercise them joints, specially above knees and hips. Start them with a set of 5. It's important you exercise with them. I did it for my parents, 3 months later its in their daily routine and old people hate changing their routine so win win. Take care folks. Escape the marketing trap. Health starts with a change in lifestyle not spending habits. Reminds me of the Snapchat case. The owner criticized Indian users. People started leaving bad reviews for Snapdeal. Tells you what kind of consumer an average indian is and the need for citizen and consumer centric policies. you should avoid products with any seed oils, refined oils, palm oil is the worst. look up latest research papers on these and its effect on body Yeah‚Ä¶ if it has been happening for a long time, then however wrong, it should be okay? Racism, slavery, casteism and so many things have been going for a long time‚Ä¶. These are some extreme examples but I hope you get my point. What‚Äôs wrong is wrong and should in no way be normalised. We are not an ideal world but we can certainly make it better by trying to make things right. I have stopped buying anything without checking the backside of contents, kuch bhi bhechte hai By that logic, people should also never ever lie or mislead even for the best intentions. How can we hope to stop these fundamental marketing lies or misleading when no person exists in the world who hasn't lied or hustled. It's not that it has been happening for long, it is just a basic level of lie and accepted. No one considers it important enough to fight against nor is responsible to protect people from simple lies; It's not remotely comparable to people fighting against racism, slavery and casterism. It makes me laugh when I see people believing that anything that comes pre-made in a packet is healthy. Just check out even your Khakra type snacks and they have used sunflower oil, which is a bad seed oil, for its cooking. Want health? 1. Do not do Swiggy Zomato. 2. Eat organic if your budget permits. 3. Cook your own food. 4. Read basics of Ayurveda of what to eat, when to eat and how to eat. Do not do Virudh Aahar. 5. Moderate exercise. Damn I didn‚Äôt knew that My whole life was a lieüò≠ believing that it's jowar Bought them yesterday.They taste good though scam of the year I live in the US and it is pretty much the same here Not to mention unnecessary chemophobia he promotes. Same with multigrain bread, brown bread etc.only top is sometimes sprinkled with grains. Rest is maida. Brown is colour Maggi atta noodles are actually made of atta instead of maida/refined wheat flour. At least that's what is mentioned in the packaging. WTF is jower? same with atta bread, i am looking at you bonn Yes, you are right, palm cultivation is harming environment and humans are exploited for it. But for environment issue I read another perspective to it some time back, I don't remember where. Assumption - Demand of oil is same or will only increase over time. Now, palm oil is highly efficient compared to other oils, also it can be used for long frying sessions without any harm, refining increase this time even more. So, that person said that if other oils are used in place of palm oil more land would be needed to grow plantations to compensate for palm oil in use today. Which makes sense to me. So, using palm oil in place of other oils is better for environment. About exploitation of humans, we as Indians can't say that working conditions are bad, because in India's farming and manufacturing exploitation has been normalized, so we are already consuming many many products made by exploiting people. I know this is sounding wrong, but Ok nowhere food is regulated‚Ä¶ government are run by corporates everywhere.. some less some more In India, we have to be suspicious of those too. Historically images have been designed to manipulate people and influence their behaviour. We need to scrutinise all the imagery that marketing puts in front of us with utmost care or they will surely make habits for of us which suits their interests. Actually 'dalda' is associated with hydrogenated palm oil using old methods, which introduced trans fats in it, which are very unhealthy. But today hydrogenation don't form trans fats. Also, palm oil from different parts of the fruit have different percent of saturated fats, in frying and baking (high temperature cooking) palm oil with high saturated fats is used. That's why in labels of such products you would see that most of the fat is saturated fats. Read my reply on similar comment. np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/15xvpqi/hate_that_food_is_not_regulated_in_india_mom_got/jx9zidx/ Doesn't seem to be the case here. In OP's pic, 100g digestive contains 9.2g saturated fat, 8.7g MUFA. In the words of Rijuta diwekar. \"fibre is everywhere. Even ghar ka kachra has fibre.\" Food is regulated in India much much much more than it is in other countries. Nutrition labels are accurate and food reporting is to the t. Take this as a lesson and educate your family to read nutrition labels. Wait! Are u saying atta Maggi isn't made of atta?!? Millets Always check the ingredients chart at the back. Another rule to it you can add is checking the amount of sugar since added sugar is responsible for a health pandemic in lots of countries, including India. An average human does not require any amount of added sugar, but if you really want to, then it should not increase more than 35 gms per day maximum. Keep this in your mind, and you will be surprised to see the amount of sugar per cookie, despite some of them being made completely from whole wheat. Another thing people don't know is generally what we call PROTEIN BARS are actually FAT and SUGAR Bars. The thumb rule is that it is a protein bar only if it has more content of protein than fat and sugar. Oh yeah, right I missed that, mb. Hello, I live in Germany and the EU has the strongest laws on food in the world as far as I know. This would totally pass here without issues because consumers are informed and know how to look at ingredient lists. I wrote a much more detailed response earlier today if you are interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/15xvpqi/comment/jx8tvsu/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/15xvpqi/comment/jx8tvsu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I have cycled through digestive biscuits before settling on McVities. Parle and Sunfeast were probably the worst ones that I tried. I worked for a collagen brand that used caramel as one of the ingredients and advertised the product as sugar-free. ü•≤ Farmilite from sun feast is the only brand which genuinely innovates. Try their millets range. I haven‚Äôt tasted a better biscuit in India. FSSAI must be having something on reporting deceptive marketing and mislabeling. Bhyi tera nail cracked lgrhaüò≠ Follow foodpharma on Instagram Join the movement. same goes with \"Atta with Multigrains \", and countless more products This is false advertising and it is unfair to consumers who are looking for gluten-free products. wait till you see the healthy section in USA. also, you could have seen the ingredients before buying it. > atta maggi what off it ?> Plus it tastes worst Total scam artists. Total sugar is 30g for every 100g, but they market it as high fiber which is 6g Should be super high sugar True. Virtually there is no control over food packages. They can claim anything. 5% jowar product marketed as contains Jowar. Creating a false impression the biscuit is made from jowar whereas it is made mostly of Maida and Wheat. Is it the same biscuit which had a song in it's ad, it was something like \"biscuit k naam pe maida kha rahe ho\"(you're eating maida in the name of biscuit)... Meanwhile majority of their biscuit is just maida. You expect 100‚Çπ kg biscuit made from jowar? Scientist here. Bruh plant based ouls don‚Äôt have cholesterol. Also consuming cholesterol isn‚Äôt associated with increased blood cholesterol levels. Check google. Wouldn't the issue of implied message come up, despite the actual message? It's reasonable to assume that jowar is an important constituent in this context, that's got to mean a lot of it went to court. What do you expect in the nation of Andher Nagari Chaupat Raja u/foodpharmer Not a legal expert, but I believe that you can take them to the consumer court and the company can argue that it is in fact an important constituent in terms of its health benefits compared to a biscuit that had 0% jowar. The court would they look at the list of contents where it is clearly labelled. There may be lower courts where you would win, but I doubt the higher courts would see it that way. But then again, I have 0 experience with taking things to court, just using my own assumptions here of how things would go. More sugar in your biscuits than jowar Yes they can literally make the packaging depict it's the healthiest food ever with great pictures and bold texts (misleading information) as long as they mention the ingredients in the back (with small font size which most people ignore) Lol yes, all of these things are a scam. Forget these \"super grains\" and \"multigrain\" crap. And always read the nutrition info and ingredients list. Atleast those aren't lies (I think). Yeah, atta maggi is crap. Better off buying whole wheat spaghetti or noodles. Well actually maida is pretty bad because of the lack of fiber. Digests very quickly and spikes blood glucose due to the lack of fiber. Atta is way better than maida. Bro. That's what I said.! Haha. My problem with such statements is that such blanket statements alone don't solve anything. If something isn't healthy you don't just always cut it out, you try to balance it. Not everything needs to be cut out. The geniuses (i definitely mean that) who get you your bread so cheap have worked to get those lost nutrients from aata, back using wheat bran (the part that's removed from aata to make maida) along with dough conditioner to still allow gluten some extra strength. Then adding other grains to add a lot of the lost fiber. Maida doesn't lose ALL the fiber. It loses most. You can introduce it back with very concentrated fiber carriers we can find in nature. Those same principles also apply to all other \"digestive\" biscuits. Again, if you want exactly what you think you want, ask a local baker to make some for you. Just buy wheafree biscuits if you want no maida. Packaged food is not even the real problem here. The neighborhood subziwalla selling vegetables - you have no idea how much pesticides they contain. India uses pesticides that are banned in other countries. The added sugar here is worse than the maida. Yeah this is typical company marketing tactics. The best way to avoid this is always look at the ingredients list. That is where they have to state the actual ingredients and can't decieve with marketing gimmicks like they do on the front packaging. Great to see people have started reading the back side of the pack where truth is written. Let's start educating the parents. I mean... it does contain Jowar ... and that's all they claim All or 95% of breads and biscuits are maida with a sprinkle of atta, ragi ot whatever healthy shot these companies claim is inside. Better have fruits üçâ Just read the damn ingredients, better safe than sorry The ingredients are always listed in order of magnitude. That‚Äôs the only place to look at. Ad ache kerdo parle ki. Sabi aise hi soch ke lete hai or lete rahenge. Same biscuits which are exported to countries like Singapore have better and different ingredients. They totally avoid maida in exporting biscuits. Gluten free products are clearly listed as such. To believe something is gluten free because you want to believe it is on you I'm curious to see their sugar free label I agree parents and children are the most gullible here. I lose my patience explaining to my parents to not trust whatever is advertised. The steps that I believe we can take is educate about this to innermost circles and ask them to do the same. I also make sure to not buy and keep anything packaged food in my homes. Get a small/medium OTG instead. You can bake almost anything with wholewheat ¬± multigrain flour & reduce upto 80% sugar ¬± fat in the recipes. Philips' OTG range is good (uniform heating/baking is the main criteria @ a good oven). Yes even i got a set of pack 10 paying 275/- later read the ingredients to be 60% maida. AND JOWAR THE WAY THEY PRINTED IN BIG SIZE HAS ONLY 5% IN PACK OF 10. SO IMAGINE THE % OF CHEAT Y do you guys print jowarcin big y cant you print in size equal to the % used. U may remove from comment but when v feel cheated we share it in social media britannia mili bikis says hi. 100% atta biscuits"
