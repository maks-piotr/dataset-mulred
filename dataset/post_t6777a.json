        "I live abroad and the food sucks here. The pasta sauce I bought in stores tasted super artificial. So I decided to make my own Arrabbiata sauce, it’s pretty straightforward.\n\n1. Pour some olive oil onto a pan.\n2. Finely mince 1 clove of garlic, 1/2 a big onion, 1 chilli and 1 capsicum. Again, finely mince.\n3. Let them cook a little bit.\n4. Add a TON of Italian seasoning/oregano and a TON of chilli flakes. Add some salt too. Mix it all in.\n5. After a few mins, add a cup of water, close the lid and let the whole thing cook.\n6. Mince 7-8 tomatoes and add them along with a 1/2 cup water. Mash the tomatoes to make them as less chunky as possible.\n7. If you have Basil, add a lot. It’s optional though. \n8. Cook the whole thing with the lid closed and on medium heat for about 12 mins. Stir now and then.\n9. Done\n\nThis should be enough for two meals (for 1 person). You could probably scale proportionately if you want more."
