    "selftext": "Tl;dr - The pizza i ordered from pizza hut (pic 3) looks nothing like the picture (pic 1 and pic 2), not even 20% close to the advertised pic\n\nNow i'd like to rant about my experience\n\nHi, I am really upset and would like to share my shitty pizza hut experience.\n\nYes I know that a lot of you must be thinking that im an idiot that i ordered from PIZZA HUT when are are multiple better alternatives, but just hear me out please!\n\nI was really hungry today and wanted to fill my stomach, but I wanted to eat something good. Now initially, I thought I can just order 2 subways and call it a day. But my dumb ass wanted to have something else coz i just recently had subway. Then it came across my mind that I haven't eaten pizza in a while. I could've fucking eaten anything but PIZZA, but no I had to eat pizza. I opened zomato and saw that Pizza F-ing Hut is offering some valentines day combo that serves 2 people. I would like to remind y'all that i was really damn hungry, so I looked at the combo which served 2 people. I knew that I could finish that shit easily coz I know my apetite. So i ordered Chicken Sausage Valentines special combo viz. Chicken Sausage medium pizza, EXOTICA VEGGIE GARLIC BREAD and pepsi. Not just that, Zomato even gave me some free EXOTICA KHEEMA GARLIC BREAD.\n\nNow the food looked really good in those pictures. I was so excited to see that I was getting a lot to eat @ just 470rs that I even used zomato's augmented reality (pic 2) to see how my food's going to look. I know that it would not going to look the same, but I didnt expect pizza hut to pack shit and some mayo on top and deliver it to me. The pizza was terrible, but those Garlic Bread, they looked f-ing horrendous. If you look at the pics that i've shared, you can see the first picture which is from the zomato menu and the second picture is from the augmented reality feature from zomato. The third picture is the reality, the shit i got from pizza hut. The garlic bread was literally a piece of bread, a little squeeze of mayo and some sad-ass veggies. The Kheema Garlic Bread also was shitty (did not click pictures of that), but it was just as horrible as this veggie garlic bread. \n\nI am extremely disappointed and it instantly killed my hunger, but i had to stuff this inside me because I did not want to waste food. But pizza hut is f-ing shit and i would recommend everyone to stop ordering from Pizza Hut",

The cheese in their garlic breads and breadsticks got replaced with mayo and the amount of cheese you get on the pizzas is like the 3 kishmish I receive from the pundit during pujas.

They actually do followup.\n\nSecondly, I'm very serious about what I'm saying: Please stop ordering pizzas from anywhere. I stopped ordering bread and pizzas a year ago because they caused me stomach pain. When I started making it at home, I realized how unbelievably easy it is to make it. Bread turns out really tasty. Pizzas are even more tasty. They never cause stomach issues, and I can add as much of toppings as I want and can even add real cheese. Some conflicting info about cheese [here](https://edtimes.in/dominos-using-a-lot-of-synthetic-cheese-and-chemicals-but-indian-media-doesnt-cover-it/) and [here](https://www.jubilantfoodworks.com/Uploads/Files/126akmfile-Offical-Statement.pdf). Just buy a good oven and bake! You are in full control of the quality of the ingredients. Long back someone posted the \"realities\" of working in their industry, and said that he saw a bakery worker drop a whole batch of bread on the floor and he just picked it up without even dusting it, and it was sold to the customer.",

Even the other toppings like capsicum, olives, onion etc were very little in quantity.\n\n\nSo basically the pizza was just the circular pizza bread base, tomato sauce and the disgusting mayonnaise in place of cheese and some miniscule topping.",
        "Pizza hut is really bad. Once I ordered some pizza from there and what I got was some spongy bread base with mayo and some vegetables on top. It tasted like regular bread.\nEven Domino's is not good and value for money.\nIts better to order from a local pizza shop or cafe.",

I always go for their Schezwan corn capsicum and capsicum Onion. Costs around 150-200 depending on offer and app. Worth!",

        "Whats you expect in rs 160 üòÇ",
        "2-3 things in pizza Hut's defence come to mind.\n\n- Pizzas taste best when they come out of the oven straight to your table. That is to say that dining there in the restaurant, the food is hot and fresh and tastes better.\n\n- If you have to order home delivery then I would prefer ordering directly from Domino's or Pizza Hut. That is, not through Zomato or Swiggy. Zomato Swiggy take their own sweet time to deliver and many times food isn't handled properly and the pizza sticks to the box and in general you get a mess. The Domino's or pizza Hut guys deliver faster and better in my opinion as they have a single order to cater to and better thermal bags etc.\n\n- To impress upon point 1, I've also seen restaurants do a better job when the customer is there, sitting in front of them as compared to when they have to hand it over to a delivery guy, where they do a \"casual\" job. I think you were a victim of this. They think customer is not there to complain and there are so many other factors to blame, if they do complain, that they do a poor job as can be seen in the difference between what they advertise and what they actually give to Zomato delivery guy.\n\n- Lastly the cold weather spoils the food. I know cold weather doesn't reduce the garlic bread topping quantity and amount is cheese used, agreed, but whatever they put, that can also be enjoyed if served fresh and hot. And that is not possible in cold weather. \n\n- Final last point - the food you get and the food in the photos is never the same. It's advertising. Accordingly you should not even expect the same. I know this is frustrating, but that's the way it is. I'm India people don't take quality and standards seriously and therefore they save costs by producing poor quality products. This happens everywhere, not just the food industry. The few people who complain and fight it in consumer courts get 3000‚Çπ or so in compensation but for most people it's not worth the effort. It's just easier to lower expectations and at least stay happy. \n\nI'm not condoning the action of pizza Hut. They should have done better. They are exploiting us in a way because we don't raise our voice. Surely. If it really means that much to you, you should sue them in court. But otherwise just let it go. Choose your battles wisely.",
        "Isn't it the same thing? Bruh.... the difference is that the cheese is not evenly spread out and the vegetables are more roughly cut.\n\nBut yeah, they could've made it better. Although i doubt the taste will change much though",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Pizza hut is a goddamn scam.....will never order from pizza hut",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Tl;dr - The pizza i ordered from pizza hut (pic 3) looks nothing like the picture (pic 1 and pic 2), not even 20% close to the advertised pic Now i'd like to rant about my experience Hi, I am really upset and would like to share my shitty pizza hut experience. Yes I know that a lot of you must be thinking that im an idiot that i ordered from PIZZA HUT when are are multiple better alternatives, but just hear me out please! I was really hungry today and wanted to fill my stomach, but I wanted to eat something good. Now initially, I thought I can just order 2 subways and call it a day. But my dumb ass wanted to have something else coz i just recently had subway. Then it came across my mind that I haven't eaten pizza in a while. I could've fucking eaten anything but PIZZA, but no I had to eat pizza. I opened zomato and saw that Pizza F-ing Hut is offering some valentines day combo that serves 2 people. I would like to remind y'all that i was really damn hungry, so I looked at the combo which served 2 people. I knew that I could finish that shit easily coz I know my apetite. So i ordered Chicken Sausage Valentines special combo viz. Chicken Sausage medium pizza, EXOTICA VEGGIE GARLIC BREAD and pepsi. Not just that, Zomato even gave me some free EXOTICA KHEEMA GARLIC BREAD. Now the food looked really good in those pictures. I was so excited to see that I was getting a lot to eat @ just 470rs that I even used zomato's augmented reality (pic 2) to see how my food's going to look. I know that it would not going to look the same, but I didnt expect pizza hut to pack shit and some mayo on top and deliver it to me. The pizza was terrible, but those Garlic Bread, they looked f-ing horrendous. If you look at the pics that i've shared, you can see the first picture which is from the zomato menu and the second picture is from the augmented reality feature from zomato. The third picture is the reality, the shit i got from pizza hut. The garlic bread was literally a piece of bread, a little squeeze of mayo and some sad-ass veggies. The Kheema Garlic Bread also was shitty (did not click pictures of that), but it was just as horrible as this veggie garlic bread. I am extremely disappointed and it instantly killed my hunger, but i had to stuff this inside me because I did not want to waste food. But pizza hut is f-ing shit and i would recommend everyone to stop ordering from Pizza Hut",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "damn üíÄ that's tough jokes aside you should contact Zomato support and put the above description in there they *might* refund you It looks so bad. üò≠üò≠üò≠ it's awful Pizaa Hut be like :- gotcha bitch, Loot liya Bhai ko I reported to zomato, i got 120rs coupon thanks bhai isse ganda aaj tak kn khaaya 120 rupees mein kaunsa pizza aata hai woh bhi pizza hut ka Brooo no way I just had this for dinner but mine was proper lmao sorry for you The storytelling makes this post. Bravo, OP. Lmfaooooo Unlike dominos, pizza hut does have a problem woth consistency. A branch would be way better than another. So while I like thier pizzas more, i tend to skip it if it is an untried branch. They are losing out a great deal of business because of this. Esp now that even normal cafes are churning out really good pizzas wow pizza hut is shit honestly lmao i just wanted to vent kuch to mil gya bhai ü§ß Why would you order from pizza hut for good pizza? bro read my story, you'll know but ok i'll tell you irrespective I was FUCKING HUNGRY AND I GOT A GOOD DEAL FOR JUST 470RS little did i know that I bought shit for 470rs Reality is often disappointingü•≤ No man, ask for the full refund. They know people fall for \"kuch to mila\" trap. You were cheated and you deserve the full refund. Food prices on zomato and pizza hut are already hiked, they charge packaging and taxes and add 70-100 rupees like this. Kisko puchu bhai? udhr kuch baat karne ke liye option hi nhi h To be honest, most western style foods are over rated and overpriced. TF is that??? Looks like someone pooped white shit with some decorations on pizza base. Bruhhh i need Eyebleach please Order history mein jaa karke report karo udhr hi to 120rs mila, ab udhr aur kuch option nahi aaray ek toh waha vo bot hi rehtay, koi human nahi hai Hey I am sry pic 1 and 2 also looks bad how can you order that. I like it more than dominos ngl. To each their own ig Bro that's not pizza. That's garlic bread. Plain and simple. Bro i was damn hungry, and they dont look as bad as the food i've received You call this pizza? Were you scammed like domino pizza, the pizza hut pizzas I order are great. This is pizza hut dude It's different for every branch lol, the one where you got yours is probably shit lol Lmfao open a new ticket bro and start a new claim process if you email them also they will look into it and give u a full refund Pizza Hut used to be golden back when I was 12 - 15 for reference I'm 22 now so around a decade ago, I eat shit food a lot and have ordered from every place including pizza Hut a bunch of times and by a bunch I mean a lot and I've seen the quality slowly decline I'm pretty sure they're going to run out of business and close shop in india. The cheese in their garlic breads and breadsticks got replaced with mayo and the amount of cheese you get on the pizzas is like the 3 kishmish I receive from the pundit during pujas. (Plus mayo in pasta). Don't order from their anymore. Rather let the business shut than tolerate shit business especialy in the fast food industry. There‚Äôs plenty that‚Äôs good. Ordering from a fast food place is not gonna get you the good stuff. Pizza Hut is the bottom of the barrel in the United States. As for the pictured, I'm not even sure what that is. \"Texas toast\" with a few squirts of cheese and minced veggies I guess. there is no option to start a new ticket bhai yaar yeh to kya ka kya nikla. Thank god i don't order from pizza hut. Lmao... I wouldn't order that shit advertised on 1 and 2 No way Wo pizza nahi hai bread hai This is the same thing you experience when you order from AliExpress/ temu/ shein lol Thats hilarious lmao i feel bad for you op I was thinking the same. It is the same shit better put together. OP walk down and get street food lol. Damn üíÄ Ffs can't believe pizza hut is being stingy with cheese but a street sandwich vendor goes crazy with it we have the same issues with pizza hut in the states. I dunno what happened to pizza hut over the last 20-30 years but the brand is ruined everywhere it seems :/ You've ordered Garlic Bread dude. Pic 2 clearly says it's Garlic Bread. Bruschetta Hut I really feel sad for Pizza Hut. It was really far better than dominos and other brands in early to mid 2000s. Most western style food tastes nothing like western style food in India. Almost every western fast food restaurant I tried in India was disappointing. Garlic bread, I've ordered from swiggy last month, the bread only cost me around 150 with some coupon and got 4 pieces as shown in the first pic.. You didn‚Äôt order a pizza lol you ordered garlic bread with some toppings on it. Pizza hut tastes like cardboard Pizza Hut is shit, ordered their pizza and it almost had no sausein it and the cheese was burned . But in the middle east it‚Äôs amazing . Choose local shops over pizza hut Complaint on Twitter That ain‚Äôt a pizza tho? Vent about something that isn‚Äôt pizza. r/ExpectationVsReality ‚ÄúAa bail mujhe maar‚Äù type beat Pizza Hut is known for being trash. You learnt why the hard way. I write all the restaurants name in notes you remind not to order from this place You guys put mayo on garlic bread? ü§î That aside the first 2 pics are diced veg, you got chopped and not enough because workers weren't skilled or didn't care. This was enjoyable to read tho. My family sat on the pavement by the road while we waited for a table when Pizza Hut first came to India. Sad to hear quality is so bad today. Sorry for this... Same is for oven story. Worst is they sent the pizza cold every damn time i ordered. I had to reheat it. Does anyone have any idea is that normal Lost my shit when I opened pic 3 lmaoooo They will die soon. Quality is none Who orders from pizza hut? There are plenty of other options. PH is dead. Ideally, if they didn't refund you the whole amount, you could have followed the proper procedures of approaching a consumer forum. You can even post it on the online consumer forum. They actually do followup. Secondly, I'm very serious about what I'm saying: Please stop ordering pizzas from anywhere. I stopped ordering bread and pizzas a year ago because they caused me stomach pain. When I started making it at home, I realized how unbelievably easy it is to make it. Bread turns out really tasty. Pizzas are even more tasty. They never cause stomach issues, and I can add as much of toppings as I want and can even add real cheese. Some conflicting info about cheese [here](https://edtimes.in/dominos-using-a-lot-of-synthetic-cheese-and-chemicals-but-indian-media-doesnt-cover-it/) and [here](https://www.jubilantfoodworks.com/Uploads/Files/126akmfile-Offical-Statement.pdf). Just buy a good oven and bake! You are in full control of the quality of the ingredients. Long back someone posted the \"realities\" of working in their industry, and said that he saw a bakery worker drop a whole batch of bread on the floor and he just picked it up without even dusting it, and it was sold to the customer. Man pizza Hut is the worst! I don't know how they are still running. Last time I went there only because Domino's was shut. The pizza was so bad and hard plus toppings were bland. Crust looks like huge loaf of bread was sliced to make the crust. So pizza Hut doesn't make the crust from scratch for each pizza? I personally hate any online delivered food they are most of the time shitty and expensive. What's the second picture? Is it AR? Last time I ordered 2 Pizzas from Pizza Hut, they literally just had their disgusting pizza like white sauce on it, which nothing but mayonnaise! There was NO real cheese in sight. Even the other toppings like capsicum, olives, onion etc were very little in quantity. So basically the pizza was just the circular pizza bread base, tomato sauce and the disgusting mayonnaise in place of cheese and some miniscule topping. Pizza hut is really bad. Once I ordered some pizza from there and what I got was some spongy bread base with mayo and some vegetables on top. It tasted like regular bread. Even Domino's is not good and value for money. Its better to order from a local pizza shop or cafe. Why does the cheese looks like Godzilla c*m on 3rd pic ? Lodge a complaint on Pizza hut website/customer care number. I used to order a lot from Pizza hut before covid, and I remember their service being nice. Upon raising a complaint, they would get the manager of said branch to call and usually offered a meal replacement free of cost. Bro.. That's not even Pizza, look like toasted bread with some toppings on it. Twitter pe daal refund milega I once ordered garlic bread from Pizza Hut long back. Never ordered it again. I used to order Dominos until an year ago but found them lacking in quality recently so switched to Pizza Hut. I think quality is dependent on the outlet you order from. There is one just opposite to my house and it serves yummy hot pizzas with fluffy base and delicious toppings. I always go for their Schezwan corn capsicum and capsicum Onion. Costs around 150-200 depending on offer and app. Worth! I happened to go to a Pizza Hut after 15+ years and they dished out a crappy pizza (375rs) which nobody would eat. Unevenly cooked base. Not enough topping, mediocre liquid cheese!! I think street side vendors provide top quality pizza for rs 100 instead of this Pizza Hut. Seriously Dominos is way better than them, even though I find Domino's pizzas very bland & dry! Have decided I will never go to any of these pizza chains ever from now on! Lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ The abruptness of the last picture made this post lol Having said that, there is a reason why they add that disclaimer 'Photos of the product are only for representational purpose' because more than often, this is what happens. And if someone tries to sue them for it, they will say we warned you. What you received actually looks BETTER than the menu pics. Still gross, though. doesnt change the fact that it was shit that's mayo lmao it's not even cheese i was hungry and i was getting plenty of food for under 500rs but i would never order again from PH At this rate OP, next time if you were to order from here, you'll only get the toppings minus the bread. yes Talk to zomato/food app customer care, they'll get your refund. no way Always tweet in such cases. Did it multiple times and always works Bro, that looks straight ass. No way would I accept this. Showed it to my wife as well she had to do a double take after I explained the sequence of photos. ü§£ i have tweeted exactly that last picture looks like shit That explains why I never liked their pizza, I have only ever been to a single branch yes Street food is much better than these scamsters they should shut shop in India Damn, that's dough pls dont order from pizza hut already done yes no problem you can laugh about it that's exactly why I even wrote this post so people can laugh about it,but at the same time they'll know pizza hut's standards Domino's>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>pizza hut both are trash dominos is less trash Where do you order pizza from then? Recommend some This is what happens when u franchise... Mojo Pizza, Oven Story exactly But they have no cheese crust right? Orders a thing, receives the exact same thing; Pizza Hut is a Scam üóø Where in the app do I get this option? It was there somewhere below I really liked their pizza about 8 years ago I think when I went with my friends. I remembered that and went 1 year ago to the same branch. It was shit. Total bullshit. Never going back there ever again They have dude look at those pictures they do not look the same Apart from the mayo not being spread all the way, literally everything is the same The bread was toasted and had those veggie toppings Mayo is the whole point....it's about how you make it, if you cannot fucking make it properly, then that's obviously a problem. On their website/helpline yes I have emailed them thank you First of all, thats garlic bread always order from your local stores Bro I laughed way too hardüòÇ Whats you expect in rs 160 üòÇ 2-3 things in pizza Hut's defence come to mind. - Pizzas taste best when they come out of the oven straight to your table. That is to say that dining there in the restaurant, the food is hot and fresh and tastes better. - If you have to order home delivery then I would prefer ordering directly from Domino's or Pizza Hut. That is, not through Zomato or Swiggy. Zomato Swiggy take their own sweet time to deliver and many times food isn't handled properly and the pizza sticks to the box and in general you get a mess. The Domino's or pizza Hut guys deliver faster and better in my opinion as they have a single order to cater to and better thermal bags etc. - To impress upon point 1, I've also seen restaurants do a better job when the customer is there, sitting in front of them as compared to when they have to hand it over to a delivery guy, where they do a \"casual\" job. I think you were a victim of this. They think customer is not there to complain and there are so many other factors to blame, if they do complain, that they do a poor job as can be seen in the difference between what they advertise and what they actually give to Zomato delivery guy. - Lastly the cold weather spoils the food. I know cold weather doesn't reduce the garlic bread topping quantity and amount is cheese used, agreed, but whatever they put, that can also be enjoyed if served fresh and hot. And that is not possible in cold weather. - Final last point - the food you get and the food in the photos is never the same. It's advertising. Accordingly you should not even expect the same. I know this is frustrating, but that's the way it is. I'm India people don't take quality and standards seriously and therefore they save costs by producing poor quality products. This happens everywhere, not just the food industry. The few people who complain and fight it in consumer courts get 3000‚Çπ or so in compensation but for most people it's not worth the effort. It's just easier to lower expectations and at least stay happy. I'm not condoning the action of pizza Hut. They should have done better. They are exploiting us in a way because we don't raise our voice. Surely. If it really means that much to you, you should sue them in court. But otherwise just let it go. Choose your battles wisely. Isn't it the same thing? Bruh.... the difference is that the cheese is not evenly spread out and the vegetables are more roughly cut. But yeah, they could've made it better. Although i doubt the taste will change much though Slap on tomato ketchup for everything. Western food in India sucks. bhai tera to ganda waala kaata I stopped ordering from Pizza hut, the day I realized that they used Mayo and Cream cheese on Pizza. The taste was disgusting, thankfully it was a personal size, so I didn't have to suffer for long. I really wanted to vomit at every bite. The 3rd one is from Jizza Hut. Unlike dominos? Bro Dominos have the same issue. Some of their outlets are decent while some utter shit. Good thing is that local pizzeria game is now really good. It's been 4-5 years since I ordered from Dominos or Pizza hut I've had the (mis)fortune of trying Pizza Hut in multiple different countries, and from my experience i can confidently gather one thing : Pizza Hut is really consistent. I've never really come across a chain that's nearly as consistent. Consistently dogshit, that is. Bro does Pizza Hut do this in every city? It happened with me every time I ordered online. (Sometimes offline too). Totally bad. Domino's is better imo. Try mozo pizza next time What you received is from cloud kitchen of pizza hut. Untrained, no professional people cook in unhygienic conditions and dont follow steps in cloud kitchens as compared to proper restaurants. also because pizza hut operates half of its business from cloud kitchens. You really dont want to see who, in what conditions and how cooks food in these cloud kitchens. Are you sure mayo? Usually, they use liquid cheese (still cheap, but not mayo). It's the same with all the companies under yum brands which includes KFC and Taco Bell. In my city we had two KFCs. One is way better than the other. I still remember once ordering a singer burger from KFC for 180+rs. I was shocked to see the size of the chicken. I took my weight scale to check its weight, it weighed just 80g. Bhai I can get 400g chicken pakoda for this price. Stopped buying from new branches after that. Stuck to the branches I know have good standards and quality control. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Veg mayonnaise is one of the worst things to put on pizzas and garlic breads. It's cheaper than cheese, tastes awful, and feels worse in the stomach since it is almost all refined oil. I only eat Domino‚Äôs because of Cheese Burst Rich people problems be like But it's not pizza, the item in the menu is clearly stated as Garlic bread? I don't know why OP called it pizza because in the menu pic, it's listed as Garlic bread.. Yeah i had it confused. ik it's garlic bread, but that shit just looks so bad r/shittyfoodporn Dude that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre supposed to look, and me and my friends love the taste, what are you yapping about man /s? its not a /s, ive never had a bad experience with them, and ive eaten in 5 different branches of theirs good for you? Chuthya katgai .. Every big foreign chain in India is a scam This coupon will also expire in 3-4 days. I had a hundred rupees coupon I got for late delivery, it expired as I forgot about it. Indeed People are getting scammed by scammers using names like domino pizza, dominos pizza instead of the original Domino's pizza. So suggested to check if it was a genuine place you ordered."
