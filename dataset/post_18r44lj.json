In this case NCH (consumer helpline).  \n\nHowever, as you can see the company can just claim they had sent a \"correct\" product and easily \"close\" the complaint. In the end, the helpless customer will forever remain vulnerable only.  \n\nNow my last option is to arrange a lawyer to litigate for paltry 1600 Rs. products...

        "Tweet about it by tagging them. Let the world know.\n\nTwitter is very useful for any complaint redressal mechanisms provided the company is responsive on Twitter.",
        "Their investigation is BS. They sent me used ladies pants instead of men's trousers. It came in a sealed Ajio bag.

        "Thanks for stating your experience in support of this post.",
        "So you hate the system because it is working as intended?\n\nThe national consumer helpline doesn't have the power to force the company to agree to anything. They're there to help you escalate. Another level of serious notification to the company that the consumer isn't satisfied and give them a chance to rectify their mistake or place on record their justification.\n\nYou can use all of this documentation to file an actual case in the consumer court, where the magistrate will have the power to force the company through judgement.\n\nAnd yes the process is necessary to avoid frivolous complains.\n\nCheck how to file a consumer court complaint. You don't even need any legal learning. Just determination. You're likely to not only get your money back but also some extra amount in lieu of your time and effort.",
        "See my point is that half of the complaints won't even proceed further if in the first step itself the culpable company denies any claim of wrongdoing.",
        "Tweet about it tagging their CEO, their marketing head, Mr. Ambani also. \nDid the same for Myntra.

Straightaway tweeted, within 2 hrs someone was on the phone with me, got replacement in 2 days.",
        "Sorry my bad.",
        "Just because Ajio replied that to the national consumer helpline does not mean it ends there. I had a similar issue with Jiomart where they blatantly said that I had requested for a refund outside of the return period and tried to close the issue then and there. I had proof that I had contacted Jiomart the very next day and I called up the national helpline and pointed out the attachment that proved my side and the helpline composed a reply back to Jiomart. \n\nIt was a back and forth process and went on for about a month but I did get my refund at the end. \n\nPersevere, follow up with the national helpline. Don't leave it at this.",
        "Trying to sort out with the company directly was the right first step. Consumer forum is the right second step. This forum, as you have found out is just a discussion and records platform. They don't actively mediate anything. The next options are:\n1. Issue chargeback if you used a credit card, or\n2. File a case on edaakhil.\n\nFor edaakhil, court fees etc should be nil, for such small claims. If not they usually get covered by the company if you've won. Also you don't need a lawyer. You can represent yourself. If you have a strong case, with all the evidence, and sufficient time and resources, go for it. If you don't, then this feeling of being cheated by the system will keep bringing you down. Don't let these companies turn you into a pushover.\n\nThis way, you'll also learn a bit more about the system. The system is only as effective as the people who belong to it and how they use it",
