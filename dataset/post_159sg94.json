I knew it was all a sham when I saw ads on YouTube few years ago which were well animated for very simple concepts with the voice of a overly enthusiastic newbie teacher when in reality the actual good teachers with experience would solve highly complex problems on a piece of paper. It's obvious they had more funding to make animations to sell the course than to hire competent teachers. Got what they fucking deserved.",

But the stories are behind a paywall (understandably). \n\nTL;DR: \n\n* Shady sales tactics. \n* Higher salary for sales people (15-18 LPA) vs actual teachers (4-6 LPA) resulting in a culture that pushes sales-at-all-costs including threatening and berating parents for not signing up while not actually delivering any lessons or value. \n* Increased refund request rate which they aren't able to honour since there is no fucking money\n* $1.2 bn term loan whose interest rates have been hiking up alongside the Fed rates (this wasn't a funding raised. It was a loan)\n\n###On a personal note: \n\nGood to see it burn. There is a really kind and nice autodriver in my area whose daugher is in 6th standard this year. They deployed sales tactics where they intentionally targeted economically-challenged people like him, berated them into signing up for high interest rate loans (financed by themselves) for their courses and have used statements such as \"Your child will be a failure in education and life like you if you don't sign up for this course. You'll come crawling back to us when she fails and we can't guarantee this rate later\" and have tried their damndest to bleed money from the poor. \n\nIn the words of Tyrion Lannister, watching this company choke on their greed and die will give me more relief than a thousand lying whores.",

Followed their own whim instead of listening to experienced ppl.  \n\nCommitted some diversion of funds as a result Ministry of corporate affairs started a SFIO (serious frauds investigation office) investigation against them during the past few weeks. \n\nSo yeah byjus is fucked up.

They almost always opt for loans.\n    * These loans are provided by 3rd-party financiers who have a 100% guarantee from Byju's of repayment in case the loan-taker cancels. \n    * The more people cancel, the more Byju's must pay out to the financiers.\n    * The number of refunds are now so high that Byju's is not even able to pay variable salary for their sales teams, let alone the fulfill the money-back guarantee for the financiers. So they are paying back financiers using money from new sales.\n* Acqusitions haven't become new revenue streams (Whitehat Jr. cost 300 million, Aakaash cost 1 Billion and none are revenue positive)\n* Older debt financed rounds still driving up the interest payable\n* Bunch of shady accounting that caused even Deloitte to quit as their accountants\n\nList goes on",

Not sustainable in the long run.\n\nThe current increase in interest rates is going to stop this funding in the near term as purses will tighten up. Many bloated startups will fail.

That's when the new CFO and auditors will release their first financial report. It will be bad. December report for 2023 should be worse. From a different reddit thread I understand that they have sold a product on EMI and have already declared the entire sales value as revenue. I guess the reporting guidelines have changed, there are defaults and sales are now bad. These 3 reasons will result in their YOY revenue taking a plunge. Dec(2023) results should be better as it will be compared to the Sep results(2022). \n\nThey have to ride out 2023 . Its essentially the Byjus family versus the investors.",

Monthly subscription option + just the report, no opinions letting me form my own. \n\nLast I was subscribed to the Ken was back in 2019/2020. Haven't read them in years. So maybe they've improved since then. Take everything below with a HUGE grain of salt.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI honestly just didn't like Ken's reporting style. They'd add in random sentences or their own opinions/positions or how I should feel about a piece of news in the middle of a report probably to appeal to a younger market but was just annoying to read. \n\nFor example \"ABC company today declared an outstanding gross debt of 3000 crores. Jesus, that's a lot of debt\" or condescending statements like \"If you've been listening, man...\" in the middle of a paragraph which I'm reading... so clearly, I am paying attention to that person's writing. What's the point of that sentence? Maybe I'm too traditional in what I expect out of a journalistic feed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, the founding team for Ken is from IIT/IIM and what really annoyed me was they liked to remind you how much bigger their dicks are compared to the rest of us plebs. There was an actual Nutgraf newsletter from H2/2020 where it was supposed to be a small apology section for some error in a previous newsletter/report but it was just them congrasturbating over all their alma maters and how it is normal for them to err occasionally. I cancelled shortly after and never went back.",

        "> Have you heard what is going on inside the company? Are the allegations true?\n\nThe sales tactic was based on dark patterns and guilt tripping parents( you dont care for your child future etc. ) and they would wilfully hide the fact that the monthly coaching fees is in form of a personal loan. Effectively parents wont be stopping paying fees but defaulting on a loan that comes with all its consquences.\n\nThe course itself was underwhelming and you can find better learning in free youtube videos.\n\nThe entire existence of the company is a con job and everyone working there has known this for a long time. I dont know how Byjus employees sleep at night, after mis selling crap courses and tying down poor parents in unpayable EMIs.\n\nI hope this company becomes ashes and each byjus employee deeply introspects their purpose on this planet. Drug dealers have better ethics than them as atleast some wont sell to kids. These people explicitly targeted kids, bottom of the barrel scum people.",

The cost of their products is high - often being higher than the school fees and they constantly try to lock in people into high payment and long term commitments.",

Do you remember last year when their whole legal machinery was bent on destroying one person?  who told the truth about Byjus.(he posted on reddit as well) \n\nByju in the beginning had a good thing going with his tutoring.

    "light_cleaned_title": "Does anyone here know the inside story of what is happening at Byju?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Quite the rollercoaster ride for Byju himself from being a tutor from Azhikode to $22bn company at its peak. Lots of recent departures of board members and lawsuits. There seem to be serious issues around transparency from Indian startups and this sets our startups back a bit on the global scale. They're trying to secure $1bn in equity now. The founder is still fighting for dear life (as one would of course expect) and apparently broke down in tears recently (source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-26/star-founder-broke-down-in-tears-as-crises-engulfed-byju-s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-26/star-founder-broke-down-in-tears-as-crises-engulfed-byju-s)) Have you heard what is going on inside the company? Are the allegations true?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Be kind with people on your way up, you will meet the same people on your way down. He is suffering from musk syndrome but is now reaching terminal stage >apparently broke down in tears Boohoo. Cry me a river Crying.? the company uses predatory practices to gullible parents. Byjus deserves everything that's coming for them Why wasn't that brought to light before or was it always known? Well said! To think, 1 kid took this mega corporation down via twitter! And im glad we all supported him!! Musk isn't a straight up scamster. Always known It was always known. These mofos don't realise the shockwaves of their actions can have on the startup economy. Some other startup douchebags are also caught up in heat with investors. What this means is that Indian VC/PE space becomes less attractive for foreign investors. They'll be extra cautious now and will demand terms not particularly favourable to the startup management. The domestic funding doesn't even begin to satisfy the capital appetite and banks in this cuntry are run on old age boomer mindsets, so cross out that option too. On top of that nirmala has removed indexation for debt funds, another blow to debt funding. I haven't been following this story much - what started all of this? A guy named Pradeep Poonia started a campaign against them. Just google his name, the entire story will come up. All they were good at is marketing their brand/courses saying this and that to gullible parents and students that'll fall into the trap through the advertisements they see on YouTube. You can only hide it for the first few years before the results come out n everyone realizes nobody who took their classes got good ranks. I knew it was all a sham when I saw ads on YouTube few years ago which were well animated for very simple concepts with the voice of a overly enthusiastic newbie teacher when in reality the actual good teachers with experience would solve highly complex problems on a piece of paper. It's obvious they had more funding to make animations to sell the course than to hire competent teachers. Got what they fucking deserved. It was always known. Everybody knows byjus has a scam business model. Had a friend who worked in byjus in sales. The whole thing was a scam. The tutors hired werent tutors, they had no technical knowledge whatsoever. Sales were instructed to target less educated folks and tie up loans in the call itself. The environment was extremely toxic with a mad rush to get numbers by hook or by crook. That was whitehat jr [The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/all-stories?search=Byju) actually has a lot of articles with insider sources on Byju's. But the stories are behind a paywall (understandably). TL;DR: * Shady sales tactics. * Higher salary for sales people (15-18 LPA) vs actual teachers (4-6 LPA) resulting in a culture that pushes sales-at-all-costs including threatening and berating parents for not signing up while not actually delivering any lessons or value. * Increased refund request rate which they aren't able to honour since there is no fucking money * $1.2 bn term loan whose interest rates have been hiking up alongside the Fed rates (this wasn't a funding raised. It was a loan) ###On a personal note: Good to see it burn. There is a really kind and nice autodriver in my area whose daugher is in 6th standard this year. They deployed sales tactics where they intentionally targeted economically-challenged people like him, berated them into signing up for high interest rate loans (financed by themselves) for their courses and have used statements such as \"Your child will be a failure in education and life like you if you don't sign up for this course. You'll come crawling back to us when she fails and we can't guarantee this rate later\" and have tried their damndest to bleed money from the poor. In the words of Tyrion Lannister, watching this company choke on their greed and die will give me more relief than a thousand lying whores. Naa he's botching up Twitter right now but he's actually built two fantastic companies in spacex and Tesla. Byjus meanwhile is a straight up scam Educational startups are like pyramid schemes , at investment stages founders and investors can make a lot of money , but in the long run they are rarely sustainable, several companies that came to my school with their products I wonder where are they now ...... EDIT: Khan acadamy is the only legit one i know , but they also has/had their fair share of money problems... After Musks takeover of twitter, these kind of twitter activism will become difficult. Fuck Musk Squid game S2 plot with happy ending: put top byjus executives through squid game to harvest their organs at the end of each game and pay back the employees with the money owned. being a ex byjus student , its a scam and im glad it's shutting down it's stupid. I can go on and on about my hatred towards byjus lol Yes, and that's owned by BYJU's Want me to call a wham-bulance. Wahm wahm wahm wahm. Pradeep Poonia was one of the first to expose Byju's. I'll dig up his reddit username but if you check the news, Byju's launched a multi-crore lawsuit against him in an effort to silence him. are there any good start ups? all of them seem to be unsustainable business models following a lossleader strategy >Byju's-owned WhiteHat Jr had filed a defamation case against software engineer Poonia in Delhi High Court in November 2020 on charges of defaming and spreading misinformation about the start-up. Edtech start-up WhiteHat Jr has withdrawn its defamation suit worth Rs 20 crore against its critic Pradeep Poonia What really! Their own company ratted them out? >In the words of Tyrion Lannister, watching this company choke on their greed and die will give me more relief than a thousand lying whores. Fuck yeah. Byju's deserves to be burned to the ground. I'm going to remember this forever now. Umm were you under a rock. 1. Byjus negative reports and tactics was trickling out since 2020 if not earlier. 2. Search Pradeep poona, whitehat Jr and byjus. You'll get a sense of how bad the Rot is. Pradeep poonia is a legend, man single-handedly fought the good fight. Lily? [ye dekh](https://youtu.be/czCFyzTVDR8) [ye bhi dekh](https://youtu.be/QR5z88iBH3o) The duck do they need a 1.2 fucking billion loan? 1.2 billion can be used for so much stuff—you can build 5000 primary schools and run them for like 10 years in that budget. [byjus sucks](https://youtu.be/QR5z88iBH3o) [fuck byjus](https://youtu.be/czCFyzTVDR8) Couldn’t have happened to a better company. Every single tear is so fuckin well deserved. Arrogance and money caught up the leadership. Look at Girish at freshworks. Still humble and down to earth. Byjus is one of the most arrogant ppl Never wanted so much ill to a company like Byju's in my life lol. Let them die horribly! There are plenty, and yes many are overvalued but they are doing a decent job. their horrible business practices aside, just imagine how much their employees would have been ridiculed by their friends and family regarding company reputation and business practices. Other companies might also show apprehension from hiring ex-Byju's employees due to the company reputation. Focused on scamming parents by guilt tripping into buying expensive useless courses. Focused more on brand endorsement. Hired srk, messi, sponsored sports teams etc. Useless expenditure. As a result had to lay off 1000s of employees. In education sector word of mouth is the most important. Their marketing failed to change their image of a greedy stupid as fuck corporation. Hence less goodwill compared to PW and other competitors. Multiple Internal corporate governance lapses. Ignored what their director's and advisor's and investor's had advised. Followed their own whim instead of listening to experienced ppl. Committed some diversion of funds as a result Ministry of corporate affairs started a SFIO (serious frauds investigation office) investigation against them during the past few weeks. So yeah byjus is fucked up. I hope it closes down and the founders get a huge slap to their ego. They really really like ssrly really deserve it. Multiple reasons: * A failing offline-tuition business where the numbers are so skewed, there is no way to profitability * The target market for Byju's cannot afford or will not pay the course fees in full, one-time payment. They almost always opt for loans. * These loans are provided by 3rd-party financiers who have a 100% guarantee from Byju's of repayment in case the loan-taker cancels. * The more people cancel, the more Byju's must pay out to the financiers. * The number of refunds are now so high that Byju's is not even able to pay variable salary for their sales teams, let alone the fulfill the money-back guarantee for the financiers. So they are paying back financiers using money from new sales. * Acqusitions haven't become new revenue streams (Whitehat Jr. cost 300 million, Aakaash cost 1 Billion and none are revenue positive) * Older debt financed rounds still driving up the interest payable * Bunch of shady accounting that caused even Deloitte to quit as their accountants List goes on Good riddance, now crocodiles cry. Scum should be hanged upside down and flogged publicly by the parents he scammed. The pandemic inflated Byju's relevance, and the growth possibility is now limited. This makes me so happy. If not for corrupt governments, this man would be behind bars. what no lol. pradeep punia aka whitehatsr ratted out byju’s baby whitehatjr which kind of started this whole domino. You 're thinking of white hat Junior. Not Byjus Yeah exactly lol.. scamming folks without any regret. And now crying How? He posted on his private account which he can still get. How exactly would musks Twitter stop this activism? Provide concrete evidence, not your opinion of what might happen. He built what?? 😂 And it’s looks like he won Jo hua achha hua... In madarchodo ne parents k darr ko business bana diya hai... My brother had received call from BYJUs for his 5 year old daughter... I know how they trick you into selling their courses... May I know which rock you live under? This is pretty much well known. I am surprised that you know this only now He's only against the woke corporate media and blue ticks who waste their time. Not against common people who mostly get bullied by big mouths on Twatter. Which ones. I only know the popular ones ofcourse. And it seems to be that they arent really solid business models. Yep, Byjus (the Company) was working more as moneylender than as a tutor. Yeah...I remember the first time he'd posted here asking for help...detailing the lowblow tactics that these companies were using to shut him up, the amount of time, money and effort spent doing was kinda unbelievable initially and then all of it spiraled. He should do an update post. White Hat Jr <= Byjus like Jio <= Reliance \"Broke down while pacing his **Dubai condo**\" Lol These people haven't paid my brother in law's three months salary. Postman. To sponsor Indian Cricket team and to pay SRK. When you are doing immoral and unethical things blatantly (stealing from poor), it means you generally don't have a single ounce of morality. So, you drive the thing down with your immorality and ego. He's gonna walk away with 50s of millions if not hundreds (already earned). Leadership will walk away with millions. Being immoral generally pays well even if it doesn't last long. It is the parents and children who purchased the course or are waiting for refund will suffer. Trust in EdTech will be broken and it will probably crumble. Hopefully then we can see rise of edtech that is actually useful. Claire? Dope quote ! It was always known. I used to have a roommate who worked on the sales team for Byjus. Used to gloat on how they utilise parents’ ego to upsell their crap products and always used to sound proud while saying so. one of the dialogues that stuck with me is “if you tell the parents that their kid is going to fail horribly and be nothing, they almost always are willing to pay any amount for the courses” I kinda felt sorry for the kids, parents and the education system that day What's the impact of indexation on Debt Funding ? Idk so I ask the same. Postman is excellent, but arent they just a software product company? The product exploded in popularity, but they are still just a software product company no? He has been active on LinkedIn since then after his Reddit and main Twitter handle were suspended. Yes yes yes. So many shameless psychological manipulations and absurd and unethical practices. Our man Pradeep Poonia really exposed this back in 2020 itself. I remember he posted a balloon video back then showing how the two companies WhiteHatJr and Byjus will die out, quite a prediction that video was Ye, ngl my first two thoughts were, wow this guy has balls and I just hope he doesn't get screwed. Preach ✨ Not yet. Not till byju and his wife get a jail sentence Yeah which is why the crocodile tears from Byju's now do not help a bit. Been there when they tried to stamp out all bad publicity. Serves them right. Where are all the stars who did Byju ads? Shahrukh, Akshay etc should pay up. They are already under scanner for financial misappropriations, however these things take time. You cannot just hold a guy and put him in jail. You have to first build a case and fight it out in court. Logon ka Paisa kha kha kar kitna dur jaogy ! Cough cough Mars by 2022, fsd in 2020 and etc Its well known. Even their auditors and board members resigned in last years. This tells you serious the situation is. Apart from that he has been shuffling the investors money into the subsidiary which is owned by him which means he just doesn't give the shit about the company and has lot of gain even if every goes down. He couped the og founders of tesla, and space ex won't survive without government contracts and have yet to reach the moon Most of the Byju's people I met weren't even making 14k a month let alone 16-18 Lakh per annum. They were screwing EVERYONE from employees to customers. Any company worth that much in such a short time definitely has multiple skeletons in their closet. +1 Is the morning context worth the subscription? I've been thinking about it for a while now It's just karma hitting back! I know a lot of parents that have cried over their malpractices. Pretty sure these issues predate the Messi brand endorsement of $500M but glad Messi charged these idiots that much. That’s half a Bill right there lol. Their finances are bs. Lol... Some of the comments here are plain dumb. Thousands of parents got screwed over. A few billions is worth a decade in the slammer, if worst comes to worst. Curious to know what will happen to Aakash if Byjus hits the dust? Although I agree with this. But one of my friend who started his company in 2015 and recently had to shut it down recently countered this argument by saying that \"if you are nice to people on your way, you will always remain on your way, you won't ever reach up.\" He confused me with this counter. Pour some wine, sit back and watch as it topples 😌 What happens to all companies eventually, greed . When he started out he had a aim , to provide quality education that was affordable because it is online. Then once it took off his aim changed, his priorities changed . He wanted to become profitable when his goal should have been to just break even. And now he doesn't want to let go and will soon either be forced out of his company or take them down with him and soon he will become another mallya or nirav modi . Aise broke down Hume bhi Dede lol A friend who was doing really well for himself at Byjus quit a few years ago. We were surprised that he was throwing away something like that. He was actually managing pretty well besides the company's reputation for slave-driving. We asked him why and he pretty much said he's tired of exploiting poor people out of their money. Up until that point I was under the illusion that their customer base was upper-middle class. Nope. Their customer base were lower middle class/ uneducated people. Very fucking predetory. I honestly can't believe how they are not being sued/taken to task by the govt. Their customer interactions are closer to mlm schemes like qnet. Every breath I take is only to see the downfall of this man! What a grade A cunt! Also on the list 1. The sham that is Cred 2. Unacademy 3. OYO 4. Ola Your friend is right. You cannot run a company, be nice and kind. Your employees will take you for a ride, because that’s what people do! Unless you get a feeling of ownership, people cannot be motivated and it’s a fact. It’s very rare to find someone who gives their all to a job. the founder already made money tht even his generations would not have to work. Now hes just playing god, tweaking something to see how it turns out. Hes already retired and now chilling I worked in Educational initiatives. It is like a competition to byjus. When I started before covid they were good. But during covid, they behaved like shit. I left that job immediately. And Messi You cannot just hold a guy and put him in jail. You have to first build a case and fight it out in court. oki lil bro. Thanks for this ground breaking revelation. I did not know this. The content is definitely worth paying for yes. Insanely well-researched, well-sourced. TMC actually wrote an article about a company I worked for years ago and they got every single thing bang on. They actually had some more gossip than even I knew internally. That's what made me a subscriber. But as with most other subscriptions (Netflix, TMC, Ken, NYT etc.), I subscribe only for a month or two, read or use up as much as I can and then unsubscribe when I know I have a tough month coming up work/personal-lifewise. So in a given year, I subscribe for maybe 6 months but spread out the subscription in such a way that I get to read the full year's worth if that makes sense. Hope that helps. Kindness does not mean making stupid business decisions... Byjus and WhiteHouse Jr. (did I spell the name correctly), I guess were in loggerheads regarding some intellectual property right? Unpopular opinion: I hope Byju's downfall does cascade into the entire startup scene. The whole startup culture needs a reset and it will happen in the next couple of years. The near-zero interest rates over the last decade till 2022 have led to a frivolous spending attitude both locally and internationally. Many startups that should not exist in a normal business scenario have been booming thanks to this free funding. They are basically running on treadmills attached to an IV support. Not sustainable in the long run. The current increase in interest rates is going to stop this funding in the near term as purses will tighten up. Many bloated startups will fail. But, that is necessary to let the good ones breathe. Yes, people will get pay cuts or even lose jobs/businesses. It is going to be painful for the next 2-3 years similar to 2008-2009. Finally some good news coming out of our Nation. Indian Edtech industry as a whole needs a massive reality check and a sweet dose of karma. 'straight up' being the operative words... All these sayings help but you know every situation is unique, every employee is unique combine this with multiple issues and you have a very volatile situation. One needs a very dynamic personality, man management, understanding how much energy for what issue and others. All this needs experience and maturity with calm mind. This is fairly non sensical take. All of tesla's modern and successful products were built and launched under musk. He literally still retains trust of Tesla shareholders despite all the bs he's pulling of at twitter. And as for the point of government contracts, they literally have no option, no one in America including nasa can make cheaper efficient rockers like spacex does. I myself agree that musk has become an oil snake merchant at twitter ruining jack dorseys work but dismissing his past work is a lazy take Aapko kya itni panchat hai Yes, but kindness and business decisions don’t deserve to go in the same sentence. You cannot be kind and run a company. You have to be strongly in the middle, set up policies and let that run the firm. It has to be right, not kind or nice. Mostly the issue is that we tend to try and be nice or kind to people because ultimately we want them to like us. Yeah that will not fly either. SpaceX is nothing but a sham. A ponzi scheme selling people dreams of space travel and banking on it. Look how favourably everyone talks about him now and look at his share prices. He talks big just so his stock price remains high. Man nasa is using space x rocket craft for their manned mission to moon Artemis. Literally their biggest project in 50 years. Space X products have a literal monopoly in its category. Is their any reasoning in you saying they're a sham. Zoho, Freshdesk, Postman, Razorpay, Delhivery, Paytm is doing pretty fine. You can't expect everything to go perfect, because we can't even retain our best talents at the moment. I saw this coming in 2017 when I worked there. They were already discussing about going public to raise more funds. Check out GoZen economic slowdown is hurting everyone. people are not paying byju and lenders are not giving loans to parents. [The edtech giant is stuck with a rising pile of unpaid loans of customers who have cancelled courses even as its founders scour the globe in search of a saviour.](https://themorningcontext.com/internet/at-byjus-a-loan-crisis-and-no-sign-of-funding) [Indian lenders cut off Byju’s air supply by not lending to its users](https://the-ken.com/story/its-now-indian-lenders-turn-to-pile-misery-on-byjus/) they could have provided relaxation to poor Indian parents instead !! Awesome. You've just convinced me about getting a subscription. I've had the app just downloaded on my phone for so long, but I never actually got around to getting a subscription That's pretty much every coaching centre in India. Byju's was great when it was a small company. Their products were amazing as well. Have personally used it and absolutely loved it. This was all before the big funding that happened in 2018 which made them the most valued edtech start up. From here i believe they were never able to keep up with the necessary growth, were always playing catch up, used underhanded and illegal techniques to sell products etc. I don't know how much of a role Ravindran Byju had in all these, or if it was his lack of control or giving in to investors. I respected him a lot as a teacher and loved his ambitions. It's just sad but this ending now seems was always inevitable. yea, total money wasted because no one outside of India even uses this ed-tech platform. Signing Messi was a dead brainer. My boss once said, itna bhi mat bure bano ki jab tum neeche giro, log tumhe laat maarne aaye Friend works for an IT cybersecurity vendor. Says that Byju’s hasn’t paid their bill for the last 6 months and their contract had to be terminated Heard the same about their Google ads bil not being paid This is 100% true They intentionally target drivers, maids, plumbers and other lower middle class people and use every dirty trick in the book Btw they also don’t disclose that their “subscription” is actually a loan EMI They even tried playing dirty with their accounting and tried to show all subscription revenue upfront (i.e. if 2 yr subscription is 2L but parent has only made 1 installment of 10k, they wanted to record 2L as revenue). Their auditor has already quit because they can’t deal with this nonsense Aakaash iirc is profitable and the only thing keeping this turd afloat M Can I steal this quote? Eh governance issues in Indian startup landscape are rampant. This is just the tip of the iceberg Fact that no one wants to admit is that they all raised money at valuations that the Indian market simply cannot support for another 5-10 years at least Zerodha and Zoho havw been extremely profitable without raising outside money Bruh wut? SpaceX’s main revenue stream is satellite launches, not moon travel And they were literally the first to build a reusable rocket. That’s rock solid tech achievement that even NASA couldn’t manage Asking 'inside' story on a public platform? Oh it goes way beyond that. Not only did they declare \"subscription\" revenue upfront, they also securitized and tranched all those receivables (loan EMIs), created an investment instrument for NRIs and tried to heavily market it to them... the same way mortgages were in 2008 crisis and in \"The Big Short\". ([Source](https://themorningcontext.com/internet/why-is-byjus-selling-its-receivables-and-what-are-they)) This way, Byju's would get money upfront, the investors would assume risk via the bonds they invest in, and if the people default on paying, Byju's assumed minimal risk for itself. The problem was people smelt bullshit and didn't buy in. In case anyone is wondering why they spent money on FIFA and Cricket... that's why. To increase brand recognition overseas. Not to market to us plebs here. Reddit has unfortunately become an echo chamber of hate. But for one comment I did not see any insider info. I have a friend of friend of friend who is there. Seems like situation is bad. They were expecting legal repercussions for sometime now . I suppose they are prepared to protect themselves and the company by now. The board of directors resigning , in my opinion, was intentional and well thought out. Investors and founders will most likely/are engaged already in a battle for control . We have to wait till September IMO. That's when the new CFO and auditors will release their first financial report. It will be bad. December report for 2023 should be worse. From a different reddit thread I understand that they have sold a product on EMI and have already declared the entire sales value as revenue. I guess the reporting guidelines have changed, there are defaults and sales are now bad. These 3 reasons will result in their YOY revenue taking a plunge. Dec(2023) results should be better as it will be compared to the Sep results(2022). They have to ride out 2023 . Its essentially the Byjus family versus the investors. You are right. Edited my comment to point that out. Thank you! Maybe it's Desi Theranos in the making. Principles and Business deserve and should be used in the same sentence and then you can run a successful company while keeping the general crowd happy. Kindness is a perspective anyways Dude he is always a snake oil salesman, boring company literally made an over priced narrow tunnel with rgb lights that ironically suffers from traffic jams. Also the main effort of boring company was to try to stall the LA to SA high speed train line. He has been promising FSD since 2014, now German cars like Mercedes, Volkswagen achieved FSD, while elon has yet do so, instead he fired the fsd team God knows when cybertruck and tesla truck will be out. And no investors are unhappy musk keeps crashing the stock and have lawsuits against him tesla investor trial What astonishes me, how can someone fcuk up the simple coaching model? I mean, in India, so many teachers teach thousands of students with the help of just 1-2 staff members and earn money. How can you fcuk up that simple business model. You don't have to manufacture anything, you don't have to invent anything. Just simply hire teachers, put them on screen, take money, give some to them some to yourself. Messi got .5 billion usd. Holy shit! Source for the $500 mil figure? When you grow too fast too soon, some.of the things that is necessary for a big corporate falls by the wayside. A big company needs strong finance, accounting, tax, HR departments. These things are not the domain of most startup founders and are paid little attention. Yes , but he is pioneer in the field of electric cars , re-usable rockets, brain machine interface etc.. Does he make wild claims about frontier technologies \"Yes\". He is nowhere comparable to BYJU's , which did not pioneer any technology , but was just a marketing and loan sharking operation. Damn. Byju’s should run a crypto token with all these shenanigans Negative effects of tvf pitchers It means you can't adjust your gains for inflation anymore. Indexation is common in property taxation, suppose you bought a house for 1 lac and sold it for 2 lac 10 years later, you simply don't pay tax on the realised 1 lac and adjust it for inflation through indexation. Look it up. Thanks, bro. No he couped tesla's founders, no re usable rockets existed a long time ago but was deemed to expensive and maintainance heavy for Nasa, heck nowadays space ex gave up on its reusable part to cut costs, and no brain interface exists but that's only for controlling robotic hands and limbs, plus most of the original research team quit or resigned, and all they do now is give pigs and monkeys brain seizures. If he wanted reusable rockets he would design something similar to the Apollo or buran shuttles. Heck there was a design for a massive shuttle that can take off without any boosters, and it did while on a runway. Instead he makes cartoonish rockets and goes full [\"supreme leader of aladeen\"](https://youtu.be/vV30irsal-w) on anyone that questions him be it tesla, space ex or now infamously Twitter Plus he has been fined by SEC numerous times for insider trading, which he is now doing with crypto. Scamming leeches The Morning Context or The Ken, if I had to subscribe to one? I am sure it was first quoted in the last millennium. You would not be “stealing” it. Half the startups as seen on Shark tank India are basically resellers. Even Boat and lenskart are basically resellers. This country lacks. an actual entrepreneurship culture. Personal opinion, not related to the article above European countries have free education and I feel india should progress towards that goal. Instead we have companies ( schools also ) which are selling education for high prices and the govt turning a blind eye towards it is an even more worrisome situation. I hope education becomes affordable in neyar future The real villains are the investors who want a get quick rich ticket out and thus push for growth aggressively. When things go south or there is a serious power struggle, the investors use their influence in the media to screw the founder. Its happened to many startups in the past and will always continue to do so in the future. Just to clarify, I am not saying that Byju is a victim here but only that that greedy powerful investors should be held responsible too. He posted on r/india? Wow. Link? Again, keeping the general crowd happy is not how a business runs. You keep clients happy by providing a service at a rate they’re willing to pay. If you’re a market leader, you set the rate. If you’re not a leader, you follow the leader. Principles is different from kindness. Kindness is a trait. You can include it in your principles of doing business but not many people have actually succeeded with kindness, unless they had immense funding or someone to help cushion their falls. u just have to find a balance between moral and efficiency. Even the world aint kind or equal giving to everyone. Morning Context is the easy choice in my opinion. Monthly subscription option + just the report, no opinions letting me form my own. Last I was subscribed to the Ken was back in 2019/2020. Haven't read them in years. So maybe they've improved since then. Take everything below with a HUGE grain of salt. &nbsp; I honestly just didn't like Ken's reporting style. They'd add in random sentences or their own opinions/positions or how I should feel about a piece of news in the middle of a report probably to appeal to a younger market but was just annoying to read. For example \"ABC company today declared an outstanding gross debt of 3000 crores. Jesus, that's a lot of debt\" or condescending statements like \"If you've been listening, man...\" in the middle of a paragraph which I'm reading... so clearly, I am paying attention to that person's writing. What's the point of that sentence? Maybe I'm too traditional in what I expect out of a journalistic feed. &nbsp; Also, the founding team for Ken is from IIT/IIM and what really annoyed me was they liked to remind you how much bigger their dicks are compared to the rest of us plebs. There was an actual Nutgraf newsletter from H2/2020 where it was supposed to be a small apology section for some error in a previous newsletter/report but it was just them congrasturbating over all their alma maters and how it is normal for them to err occasionally. I cancelled shortly after and never went back. Wow, thanks! > Have you heard what is going on inside the company? Are the allegations true? The sales tactic was based on dark patterns and guilt tripping parents( you dont care for your child future etc. ) and they would wilfully hide the fact that the monthly coaching fees is in form of a personal loan. Effectively parents wont be stopping paying fees but defaulting on a loan that comes with all its consquences. The course itself was underwhelming and you can find better learning in free youtube videos. The entire existence of the company is a con job and everyone working there has known this for a long time. I dont know how Byjus employees sleep at night, after mis selling crap courses and tying down poor parents in unpayable EMIs. I hope this company becomes ashes and each byjus employee deeply introspects their purpose on this planet. Drug dealers have better ethics than them as atleast some wont sell to kids. These people explicitly targeted kids, bottom of the barrel scum people. When you become too big and ambitious for your own good. Poor Corporate Governance Overextending the business by diversifying too much and making too many acquisitions. Aggressive and unethical sales practices. Byjus have good products - but the manner in which they sold them - left a very poor taste in the minds of consumers. The cost of their products is high - often being higher than the school fees and they constantly try to lock in people into high payment and long term commitments. I am glad to see them burn. Do you remember last year when their whole legal machinery was bent on destroying one person? who told the truth about Byjus.(he posted on reddit as well) Byju in the beginning had a good thing going with his tutoring. Investors saw some potential to take it to the national level. Somewhere along the line, the product turned from education to education loan. This was also the pivot to predatory sales. Sure you can only make so much money by education, but tons more if your product is financial. A baddass description of Byjus😂 Who needs tablet of pre recorded videos. I hope this company go down completely because i hate these byju scammer calling me and funny part is that these shitheads even abuse you on call before hanging up the call even though you politely telling them not to call you for selling courses. Practices like? Just curious Wait wait, what did Cred do? I use that app and I need to know if its shitty like Byju's. What sham!?? You need to be kind yet be firm. Get the work done, the greatest world leaders have gotten the work done and are extremely supportive as well, so treating any employee like trash will lead you no where. Supportive is different from kindness. Greatest world leaders say they’ve used kindness but they know the only way to get things done is processes. Kindness is subjective. Kindness doesn't mean being overtly sympathetic. Kindness means being empathetic and consider employees as human firsts. Bare minimum Kindness is expected and should be learnt. Kindness doesn't mean you have sell your assets fur your employees lol Nailed it , Pick up from China Sell in india Always worked so far 🫠 There are a bunch of space startupts that are designing their own hardware/software, landing contracts and already making $$$ - Skyroot, Pixxel India, etc. Then there are some startups in the vehicle/automobile space: Pravaig Dynamics, Ultraviolette Automotive (they have already started shipping their bikes and are well liked by the public). Surprised that noone else pointed them out. But you are right, most startups in india are just glorified resellers/nonsense. only few of them are diamonds which are rightfully growing beautifully and I have very high hopes from them.

I don't exactly consider Postman as a proper startup like the other ones i mentioned, maybe because of my bias - there is a huge difference in making a glorified API tester tool (that too slow and extremely bloated - i can use vs code extensions or good old curl at this point) and making own rocket engines, rockets, bikes and cars. agree Had you taken the annual plan, you woulf have paid the same as with 6 months of switching on and off. Thanks for your comment tho. I will check out TMC. Joe? Oh no 😢 Anyway 🥱 Yes, I'm quite late to this thread g Boss even in Theranos case the husband was a Desi Mostly \"homeless beggars\" dressed up in fancy suits asking for millions. Just curious, how many businesses have you started and scaled? I don’t think that information should matter to you, kind stranger. It does... Because at least in my personal experience this what you said is not always true. So maybe you have some other experiences? I do :) and I’d prefer to leave it at that. Hears this from a businessman, who met a woman working in sales of bjyus in the call center. They used to scam poor people by telling them to take loans to buy their course which got them the funding byjus needed! Inhumane to target people like that, who didn't even know how to speak english."
