        "How is it that all smart people are anti-nationals? Or anti-nationals are smart? /s",
        "The article says & I quote “Subbarao underscored the necessity of four critical elements – rule of law, strong state, accountability, and independent institutions – to realise this aspiration.” Apart from 2nd element, other 3 are not happening 😁",
        "There is actually a connection between education, intelligence, and not being right wing.",
        "need to bring \"1 kid policy\" or 2 kids if rich for 1 or 2 decades.",
        "Modi just want to make india into a Sweat Shop..",
        "Now he'll be branded anti-national.",
        "China is suffering right now because of that said policy. Btw people have grown aware of day to day expenses and are having less children then before.",
        "What did he do well?",
        "Are you not reading papers? The current problem all countries, except in Africa, facing is the decline in population. \n\nTake China and Russia as example.",
        "Couldnt have said better",
        "*** intense Snowpiercer vibe ***",
        "That would probably lead to an uneven sex ratio in the country.",
        "The second element is also not happening. Strong doesn't mean a government led by the incompetent, perpetually power hungry, and morally bankrupt kind that we have now. Strong means a State that has the ability to listen to its people, the ability for an elected leader to face the media, be accountable, face up to criticism etc. \n\nIf we just go by the definition even North Korea and the Taliban have 'strong states', but no one in their right mind wants to be that.",

        "Your definition of a strong state is a rational one. The Govt isn’t rational at all.",
        "this is a short film right",
        "Yes. A creeping horror film. Where children are in the last bogie and every few years you move forward one bogie until you realise the first bogie is the fuel supply.",
        "😃👍 except the first bogie is the fuel tank where adults are liquidated.",
        "There's a differenc between a strong and powerful state. Read pranab bardhan' essay on political economy in India. The Indian state is powerful , but not strong",
        "Only RWers and geopolitics aficionados celebrate this. They think being the 3rd largest economy will give them brownie points on internet debates and allow the country to bomb and kill enemies of the state at will. \n\nInequality and unemployment can go to hell",
        "We are 1.4 billion , so even if we become economically the size of the US , we would be a lower middle income country, where is the surprise there\n\nAnd doesn’t mean we should stop growing because if we don’t grow and don’t grow quick, we will always be a poor country… unless the denominator decreases somehow, which isn’t happening \n\nTo properly put it in context, if we lost 1 billion people right now, we would still be the second most populous country in the world, that’s how big we are.",

        "Citizens of most wealthy country in earth, i.e., The USA, are poor, have more than one jobs to support themselves and dread a medical emergency because it might bankrupt them to oblivion. So if country's economic status doesn't translate into economic welfare of its citizens, which it most likely is the case, from citizens perspective, economic wealth of the country doesn't work well.\n\nI'm all in for the India becoming the 3rd largest economy, if and only if it comes with excellent labour laws, unionised worker pool and worker protections. This would ensure that the richest don't end up exploiting Indian worker pool.",

        "The Locopilot doesn't even care at this point whether it jumps the signal or hits an animal",
        "While what he is saying isn't wrong India does walk into any negotiating table with more power as given the size of our economy it makes it easier for us to negotiate trade deals at more favourable terms in exchange for giving countries/companies access to our markets \n\nThis doesn't change the fact that most of the people on an individual basis will NOT benefit from the wealth creation that the country will see in the future. It's quite possible we might look like an oligopoly or oligarchy like Russia",
