And also, if a businessman is able to generate employment for others then he should be able to pay back the loan. Then why waiver?",

I am no fan of neonationalists.",

        "Bro! \nBad Loan and Writeoffs are technical terms for banks to tell their shareholders that these loan payments are not on time etc, governed by RBI rules. This does not mean loan forgiven. \n\nUnless you hear the words “Loan Restructured, Loan Waive-off, loan forgiven, or Loan discharged” the lenders can pursue the recovery of loan by all means including bankruptcy by NCLT, courts etc. \n\nSince you threw around a name, very curious to know which Adani loan got restructured, waived off or discharged by government or PSU banks?",
        "Yet we see next to no recovery of written off loans.",
        "you missed the part where investment in business one time will produce salaries for many years to come - in many multiples of the loan.\n\nSo a one time loan of 1 crore produces 100 crores in revenue and salaries over decades. It will also produce 10s of crores in taxes. That's a great loan.\n\nA one time education loan of 1 crore will only pay salaries to professors of about 1 crore. And it won't produce many cross in taxes until you assume that the loan enabled a few people to earn a lot more money over decades - like the loans given to elite students at prestigious universities (which also happens)",
        "Yet none of Adani's other businesses have been seized for the repayment of the written off loans.",
        "You totally missed the point of the commenter above",

        "Sorry for being blunt but this is the exact reason why we require further financial literacy.\n\nThere is very little to no similarity between Business and Retail Loans.\n\nRight from sourcing to assessment to monitoring, provisioning and risk management. They can not be more dissimilar.\n\nAnyway long story short who said your loan can't be waived?\nYou can default in your loan (hopefully with valid reasons) all recovery procedures will be deployed and if everything fails your loan will too enter the NPA books a few years down the line it will be technically written off. \n\nMore than ₹ 4.7 lakh crore Agriculture Loan has been written off till date. ₹1.2 Lakh Crore in in Housing Loan has been written off till date despite being collaterally backed due to faulty assessment of the Bank. So for a clean advance  such as a personal loan whose primary security would like only be assignment of your future salary etc. it wouldn't be something too hard to write off.\n\nSo go ahead ruin your credit rating, future prospects of getting any further loans and enjoy the day my friend.",
        "Just ask yourself a question. If you had a 100 crores with you and you could loan it,\n\nwhom would you loan it to?\n\n\\> A business which will generate profit and can pay your loans back?\n\n\\> Personal loan to a person?\n\n\\> Home loan?\n\n\\> Commercial property loan?\n\nI would prefer the 1st and 4th option.\n\nBusiness loans provide capital which if used properly will generate income to a few tens, hundreds or thousands.\n\nCommercial property loans also generates income\n\nWhile home loan is a secured loan, but if you default its an added burden to auction and recover dues.\n\nPersonal loans have no guarantee and if you don't pay up, it's again an added cost to follow the legal procedure. Plus if you don't have any means to pay it will be written off.\n\nAlso its cheaper to give a large loan than a loan for a few lakhs.\n\nThe banks have to do verification and checks which costs money and hence the processing fee.\n\nBut for a large loan, the banks can give it at a low rate of interest (sub 10%) and yet make decent profits.\n\n So to sum it up i would happily give a loan to a promising startup or a business than a person.",

        "Because some business fail. So their loans get waived off and IBC proceedings start if that fails then all is lost. Yes there is a difference in how the money would be used factor affects. From the banks POV the ROI on the business loan is more than a personal/education loan. So they would want that. From GOI pov business are more important than a single individual and a business affects a larger scale of individual, so naturally they support more benefits for businesses.\n\n\n>if a businessman is able to generate employment for others then he should be able to pay back the loan.\n\nThe employment charges are his expense.

The bank wrote off all the 5 parts from the day it became a NPA slowly, though. 1/5 th recovery is from assets that were left of the business.\n\nThats means the loan is written off and considered bad debt as the entity which owes it has stopped its existence. Civil/Criminal liability cases can be continued against the business owners if the bank can prove it. (Wilful defaulter cases). This would be a new case and would drag on for years. But, thats how these two separate cases work.

It is not because they are more efficient or competitive.",
        "Yes because writing off is the last step in the loan recovery procedure. Generally everything is sold off before a loan is written off. A non performing asset goes through various stages of provisioning before finally being written off. Generally a loan is written off after 3 years of a loan becoming NPA during that time, the account would have its assets sold legal procedure started and insurance amounts claimed.",

A businessman would have taken a loan to setup new factory, then give employment to 1000s of people. No That’s the trick.

Never pay a single rupee to thugs and goons who are responsible for so many suicides in this country Should I have added /s to it? Yes, My loan generated employment for myself and then I am paying 30% of my income in taxes. Few more in indirect taxes. Btw, are you saying there are different rules based on how money is used. And also, if a businessman is able to generate employment for others then he should be able to pay back the loan. Then why waiver? How does a normal peasant who's listening to Mahua Moitra or SRK from Jawan as their source of loan waiver understand this? They've never heard of bankruptcy I guess. Also, the biggest scam in India is keeping alive loss making PSUs at the cost of tax payers for decades, not the private business 'loan' waivers. Discrimination based on Caste happens everyday, did you ever think of filing a case? A person from SC/ST/OBC can score a third of the score of a General applicant and still get through. >my loan of few lakhs You answered yourself. Those few lakhs are your problem and not the government. Had it been few lakh crores it becomes their problem. Most personnel whose loans were waived off belonged to the particular community. Do you think this angle could work? Once again I ask, name one businessman whose loans have been forgiven. “Further, almost all the bad loans written off are what are referred to as ‘technical write-offs’. The Reserve Bank of India defines technical write-offs as bad loans that have been written off at the head-office level of a bank, but remain as bad loan“ Disclosure: You can look at my posts. I am no fan of neonationalists. Loans to bit businesses are written off, not waived off. Written off means that the business has missed a few EMI payments and the bank is now going to pursue other means to get back the loan. The bank will go after what ever collateral (company shares, promoter shares, company property etc.) There is only one group in India who regularly get their loans waived off. Adani comes on top of my mind. Please also read other parts of the article which states loans once written off the bank could recover only 1/5th of it and the rest was waived as it couldn't be recovered. Rookie mistake. You are supposed to start a business and then take a loan of lakh crores and then pay some crores out of that through electoral bonds to the party at Centre. That’s part of the problem. The MBAs and bureaucrats think they are being very clever with their terminology by keeping common man out of loop with their technical meaning out of sync with literal meaning. Bro! Bad Loan and Writeoffs are technical terms for banks to tell their shareholders that these loan payments are not on time etc, governed by RBI rules. This does not mean loan forgiven. Unless you hear the words “Loan Restructured, Loan Waive-off, loan forgiven, or Loan discharged” the lenders can pursue the recovery of loan by all means including bankruptcy by NCLT, courts etc. Since you threw around a name, very curious to know which Adani loan got restructured, waived off or discharged by government or PSU banks? Yet we see next to no recovery of written off loans. you missed the part where investment in business one time will produce salaries for many years to come - in many multiples of the loan. So a one time loan of 1 crore produces 100 crores in revenue and salaries over decades. It will also produce 10s of crores in taxes. That's a great loan. A one time education loan of 1 crore will only pay salaries to professors of about 1 crore. And it won't produce many cross in taxes until you assume that the loan enabled a few people to earn a lot more money over decades - like the loans given to elite students at prestigious universities (which also happens) Yet none of Adani's other businesses have been seized for the repayment of the written off loans. You totally missed the point of the commenter above Which one bhai? What's that got to do with anything? Borrowed money is still borrowed money regardless of what it gets used for. You know what to do. Don’t be a common man and borrow $100M /s Sorry for being blunt but this is the exact reason why we require further financial literacy. There is very little to no similarity between Business and Retail Loans. Right from sourcing to assessment to monitoring, provisioning and risk management. They can not be more dissimilar. Anyway long story short who said your loan can't be waived? You can default in your loan (hopefully with valid reasons) all recovery procedures will be deployed and if everything fails your loan will too enter the NPA books a few years down the line it will be technically written off. More than ₹ 4.7 lakh crore Agriculture Loan has been written off till date. ₹1.2 Lakh Crore in in Housing Loan has been written off till date despite being collaterally backed due to faulty assessment of the Bank. So for a clean advance such as a personal loan whose primary security would like only be assignment of your future salary etc. it wouldn't be something too hard to write off. So go ahead ruin your credit rating, future prospects of getting any further loans and enjoy the day my friend. Just ask yourself a question. If you had a 100 crores with you and you could loan it, whom would you loan it to? \\> A business which will generate profit and can pay your loans back? \\> Personal loan to a person? \\> Home loan? \\> Commercial property loan? I would prefer the 1st and 4th option. Business loans provide capital which if used properly will generate income to a few tens, hundreds or thousands. Commercial property loans also generates income While home loan is a secured loan, but if you default its an added burden to auction and recover dues. Personal loans have no guarantee and if you don't pay up, it's again an added cost to follow the legal procedure. Plus if you don't have any means to pay it will be written off. Also its cheaper to give a large loan than a loan for a few lakhs. The banks have to do verification and checks which costs money and hence the processing fee. But for a large loan, the banks can give it at a low rate of interest (sub 10%) and yet make decent profits. So to sum it up i would happily give a loan to a promising startup or a business than a person. Nice one sexy boy 😏😏 I got his point and totally support his point. The real crime is government running PSU bank. What public service does government provide through PSU banks (that are a sink for our tax money in the name of recapitalisation every 5 years) that cannot be provided through regulation of private banks? Ah yes the common man-paradox which group is that? Many these corporate borrowers are wilful defaulter, which means they have the means to pay the loans, but they choose not to. [Wilful defaults rise to Rs 3.53 lakh crore, to spike further | Business News - The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/wilful-defaults-rise-to-rs-3-53-lakh-crore-to-spike-further-8984688/) Furthermore, banks took 70% haircut while resolving IBC cases.

It allows the govt to practice reasonable discrimination which is how affirmative action is allowed. Depends… it could be a total coincidence that those people belonged to a certain community. Farmers Do not underestimate the power of 'connections' in India. And this is why most employment applications have a brief question on whether you are a \"Politically connected person\" ;-) > Also, the biggest scam in India is keeping alive loss making PSUs at the cost of tax payers for decades PSU's purpose is to provide service, not to generate profit. But what else can I expect from an oversmart techbro. I bet you think BSNL was loss-making because it was a PSU and not because the government kept shooting it in the foot. PSUs have no incentive to perform or be self sufficient with profit and employees are incompetent af. They drain tax payers money. There should be no govt companies doing business. PSUs were created as a result of socialism back in 20th century. Govt has no business doing business. Yes inflation's biggest beneficiary is the government as their old debts can be serviced easier. You need some basic economics lesson to understand PSUs and inflation. I see your number has never been in Bajaj Finance Database. Bro forgot he's aam aadmi 😂 /u/Apprehensive-Bus375, thank you for exactly the kind of smug libertarian techbro response that I was expecting. >PSUs have no incentive to perform or be self sufficient with profit and employees are incompetent af. They drain tax payers money. If anything,they provide the worst quality of services and charge the same or more as private companies. There should be no govt companies doing business. PSUs were created as a result of socialism back in 20th century. Govt has no business doing business. What if I told you the issue is not the concept of PSU but the execution of it? >Yes inflation's biggest beneficiary is the government as their old debts can be serviced easier. Inflation is hidden taxation. You need some basic economics lesson to understand PSUs and inflation and clearly the perfect example of the peasant I was talking about. Low inflation encourages spending and investment as opposed to stable or deflationary economy. Once more, you are unable to understand the difference between a concept and its execution. You need and I quote, \"some basic economics lesson to understand PSUs and inflation and clearly the perfect example of the peasant I was talking about.\" Or have fun camping on top of Mount Dunning-Kruger. There's so much that you don't understand that you're even unable to realize how much you don't understand. Bro buy a financial literacy course on udemy or whatever website Get out of here with your logic! We're looking for entertainment here, not logical arguments. Can OP get a payment waiver for that?? /s >PSU's purpose is to provide service, not to generate profit. Then explain the continued existence of PSUs which do neither. Because some business fail. So their loans get waived off and IBC proceedings start if that fails then all is lost. Yes there is a difference in how the money would be used factor affects. From the banks POV the ROI on the business loan is more than a personal/education loan. So they would want that. From GOI pov business are more important than a single individual and a business affects a larger scale of individual, so naturally they support more benefits for businesses. >if a businessman is able to generate employment for others then he should be able to pay back the loan. The employment charges are his expense. The item to focus is revenue, cash flow and GP/NP in a business loan. 1/5th of the loan was recovered after IBC proceedings that means the business or company ended its existence and only 1/5th was recovered 4/5th was full loss. The bank wrote off all the 5 parts from the day it became a NPA slowly, though. 1/5 th recovery is from assets that were left of the business. Thats means the loan is written off and considered bad debt as the entity which owes it has stopped its existence. Civil/Criminal liability cases can be continued against the business owners if the bank can prove it. (Wilful defaulter cases). This would be a new case and would drag on for years. But, thats how these two separate cases work. Eg YES bank case, they pinned it on the owners and the business itself did the same, so the business is off the hook and the owner is in the jail for criminal liabilty. Largest amount of loans to individuals and businesses ( of all sorts MSME to large ) are backed by public sector banks and other institutions. That itself is the biggest reason they are useful. Ofcourse they have lots of client to whom a single rupee should not be given no matter what the circumstances be. But, hey that will be like 20% of the total. The other issue is regulation of private banks, you can only incentives them to do the GOI bidding and not order them. That should costs more money than just recapitalisation. Actually what they are trying to is better. Make govt companies but let them fend for themselves. Basically you make money you pay your salaries and manage your business. You compete with other players in the market so like the GOI is the shareholder but the PSU functions like a normal limited company. How does inflation help in servicing their old debt ? I'll read it up but still ? Private banks offer the same loans with less corruption, better service, and better due diligence. Vehicle loan from PSU banks are not any different from any other banks. The reason why PSUs have big loan books is because they are bankers for government and other PSUs. It is not because they are more efficient or competitive. Yes because writing off is the last step in the loan recovery procedure. Generally everything is sold off before a loan is written off. A non performing asset goes through various stages of provisioning before finally being written off. Generally a loan is written off after 3 years of a loan becoming NPA during that time, the account would have its assets sold legal procedure started and insurance amounts claimed. >PSU's purpose is to provide service, not to generate profit. >>Then explain the continued existence of PSUs which do neither. Sure. Our government's incompetence and inability of our people to hold the government accountable. There's your explanation. 'Indian government runs its PSUs poorly' is not an argument against the existence of PSUs/SOEs themselves. I do not argue against the purpose of PSUs. If railways and state transport bus services were not publicly owned, more than half the country would not be connected. Same goes for other utilities. What I don't see a reason for is to have PSUs like British India Corporation Limited. Nationalised in 1981. Hasn't made a profit since 1989. Ceased manufacturing in 2005. Still employs 1800 people doing fuck knows what - new equipment installed in 2005 has never been used. Finally Govt announced shutdown in 2022 but yet to happen AFAIK. >inability of our people to hold the government accountable. I agree with you that this is the root of most, of not all problems in the public sphere. > You can default in your loan (hopefully with valid reasons) all recovery procedures will be deployed and if everything fails your loan will too enter the NPA books a few years down the line it will be technically written off. What are valid reasons to default on loan? Why/how did Anil Ambani receive loans that he is unable to repay? If I do not repay my loans, my life will be poor. Has the unpaid corporate loans affected Anil Ambani's lifestyle? Is Anil Ambani living a poorer life, without paying his loans? > More than ₹ 4.7 lakh crore Agriculture Loan has been written off till date. ₹1.2 Lakh Crore in in Housing Loan has been written off till date despite being collaterally backed due to faulty assessment of the Bank. Banks have written off 7.4 lac crore (large) corporate loans in last 9 years How does financial literacy help to logically explain any of these questions? Financial literacy = accept that corporate loans can be written off without consequences while retail loans write off has consequences for person who took the loan. If Anil Ambani's loan is not guaranteed not supported by another company, what were the checks performed before giving such high loans? Why is there no action against those who gave such large loans without enough collateral to support it? Why would any corporate loan be given without personal guarantee? If the proprietor doesn't trust his own business, why does some bank trust the business to be successful & repay the loan? If Anil Ambani's loan is not guaranteed not supported by another company, what were the checks performed before giving such high loans? Why is there no action against those who gave such large loans without enough collateral to support it?"
