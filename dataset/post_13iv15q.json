(I'm a mechanical engineer, working as a manufacturing engineer since the last 10 years and I've been thinking about getting into software/electronics. I'm mainly interested in Robotics.)\n\nI've thought through this and I've decided to take up embedded systems programming. Right now, the only viable way of doing this (that I'm aware of) is to get into a classroom course (like [this one](https://iies.in/certification-courses-freshers/embedded-system-course-with-placement/) offered by IIES) since I also need a nominal guarantee of getting a job once I complete the course. My 2 year plan is to get into an MS in Robotics after this.\n\nCould you people be so kind to offer some legit advice on my plan of approach - like how sound my plan sounds, potential pitfalls etc? This would be a serious career change for me (or anyone for that matter) and would have life altering consequences.\n\nYour advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

        "1. Right now, I don't have any relevant work experience related to robotics. I'm working on a personal project for that.\n2. I'm required to know embedded systems if I'm to get into robotics anyway.\n\nSo, if I get into a course into embedded systems, get placed and work for a while, I'd have a relevant experience, along with the project I'm working on, to apply for an MS. That's the plan.\n\nAny suggestions?",
        "> I'm required to know embedded systems \n\nWhile I agree that it's a good-to-have, I don't see it listed as a prerequisite. I checked CMU and UPenn curricula just as examples.\n\nI asked because embedded systems is a low level of abstraction (and not just limited to robotics) while robotics in general is a higher level of abstraction (that also involves embedded systems at the bottom layers of the stack). \n\nThe course and possible job may turn out to be not that directly relevant to robotics. If a person had zero work experience, it's fine. But since you already have lengthy work experience, I wondered why that indirect route. It's your choice, of course, but maybe consider a direct route straight to MS.",
        "I'm glad that we're having this conversation. I'm stuck in a position where I still think my current profile is not strong enough to warrant an admit if I were to apply. This is the reason why I've been putting forward MS applications for the last 6 years. You're challenging my assumption and that's the good thing.\n\nI'm truly afraid that the paper pusher job might not provide much strength to my application and that is why I'm trying this apparently roundabout route (along with the project I'm working on). Maybe I'm overthinking this. I've therefore planned to go to an education conselor to talk about this tomorrow.\n\nComing to embedded systems, like I mentioned before, it offers me two advantages - \n1. A good thing to have for MS robotics application.\n2. If the first option were to fail, I'll have a better career in the future compared to the one I have right now.\n\nAlso, even though embedded is not a hard requirement for the MS application itself, it's an almost must-have if you're to build a physical robot (which I'm doing right now) for programming the controller.\n\nRegardless, as you said it's not a hard requirement. I'm anyway determined to apply starting this year after completing my project.",
