        "As a person living Canada. I have to disagree with two of your points: \n\nHealthcare and Taxes.\n\nCanada is known to have horrible healthcare. Not because of its lack of quality or because its expenses, but because of accessibility. In Canada you have free healthcare. But it’ll take you 2 weeks to get a doctors appointment. If you go to the ER, unless it’s life threatening they won’t attend to you immediately. That means, if you go with a broken arm and you’re in an insane amount of pain, they’ll make you suffer that pain for 12hours before they treat you. There have been so many news articles and posts here on Reddit about people dying in the waiting room after waiting for 15+ hrs. There’s no point in having free healthcare if it’s not accessible in the first place. India to me, seems to be doing much better in this case. It’s expensive in India for sure, but you’ll get treated pretty quickly. \n\nAnd Canada has ridiculous tax rates and housing prices. The good thing is that, I guess people in Canada can feel a little good because you get atleast something out of the tax money compared to nothing in India.",

So it's still same for us indians except rich can have good life. As for taxes, all countries are suffering from high taxes but atleast Canada gets something back in the name of development. \nI know it's not easy for you to live in canada alone and away from your family.

We are fortunate that we live Ina democracy and we should be proud of that, as we should of the natural resources of our vast and diverse land. But in order to change India we have to change our thinking and every Indian needs to change that as well. We have come a long ways in many areas that we couldn't have imagined 20-30yrs ago but there is at least another generation or two's worth of work left. Look around us, they area bunch of failed states! We are the 3rd largest and growing economy. But the country needs STRONG LAW N ORDER ENFORCEMENT first and foremost and only then can talk progress be made. \n\nSo figure out how we could start making that as the priority because in a democracy, if you don't have LAW enforcement, it quickly turns into a jungle rule which is what India feels like at times like today",

Our neighbouring countries providing no support or partnership. Congress trying to turn India into a muslim state. Sardar Patel had the same vision for India as Mao did for China to turn into an Industrialist country, however he was sidelined and instead muslim/western puppets like Nehru/Gandhi were in charge who absolutely had no economic and industrial vision for India, they were muslims disguised as Indians and had no intention to develop the country. Now BJP only came into power in 2014 and still has done a lot more in the last 10 years than Congress has done for the last 70 now if you expect 100's of years of damage to be overturned over night, that is wishful thinking. However India is still doing better than majority of countries at the moment, but a bit ironic and hypocritical coming from Nepal which is in a much worse state? Either way not the point, if you look at Western countries currently UK/Canada/America the citizens of those countries are absolutely dreading being there as the rise in costs, unemployment and basic living costs are unbearable while LGTBQ/Trans agenda is in full effect in schools, there is a complete retardation of society happening in the western world.

Why should I be proud when I go outside of my house and the roads are full of garbage and potholes and air stinks because of pollution and there is concern of safety each time. I'm leaving India, when I was a child, I thought I will die for India, but Indians will never change and our land will never change. I will give up my passport, my nationality in a heart beat. I don't care if other country citizen will be racist towards me at least I will experience a clean environment, good infrastructure and a good life. Rather living like a dead beat in a 3rd world country who has nothing to offer except fake patriotism.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "All your 'why's' are valid. The question we have to ask ourselves is, why did we allow things to reach this state of affairs? We also need to reevaluate our voting reasons, choices & why we would rather fight with each other instead of holding the: elected Parliament members, the Civil servants , the Babu's, the Media, the fake news peddlers, the Godmen, women etc, etc... Indians need to stand together & take on that above list of irresponsible destabilizing individuals. We need to fight this downfall & take back our country...Or we could leave & find a new home. Your views are valid too. As an individual, I am too tired because of these news, I just can't handle it anymore. I am feeling ashamed that I don't feel patriotic anymore towards my country, whom I once loved. i get your point. there’s actually no shame in opting for a better citizenship. plenty of indians are already giving up on their citizenship. Given an opportunity whole of India will leave India, of course except the Amdanis and parasitic class and I very much understand your rage and anger. But remember it is our problem and each of us is responsible for it. We are the ones who vote for these religious bigots and we are the ones who salute the Bahiyas and mafias... Blame us ! India is no 1 when it comes to shitting in public Corruption Pissing on every single wall Raps Corruption Malnutrition Ignorance Religious treachery You can add more Agree India is nothing but the people themselves. Bring positive change in your daily lives and then slowly things will improve. Problem is generational corruption and what not. Seems to be never ending unfortunately. Totally correct this isnt an airport Read manufacturing consent and narrative control. It's what conquerors have done. Divide and conquer is the visible bit of it. Congress has continued it, the rest are doing the same. Yes, there are major holes in the theory but it fits us and most developing/3rd world country stories. Agreed If voting changed anything, it would be illegal. Good luck voting for Tweedledee and Tweedledum backed by corporate interests and funding. ok at least good in sports wait There won't be any airport soon too because they are falling down like dominos OP needs Ayurvedic Chavanprash Yes please deliver it We the tax payers bare the burden of whole country yet no benefits are received.where Education should be merit basis equal opportunity for everyone they have reservations. No wonder People from all professions leave india for higher education or to settle outside,atleast they get merit based education,better opportunities and better life style. Being born in india is like a curse that too in middle class. If indians go to another country, you end up making it a mini India. Unless you stay and put effort to clean things up, its hell. Remember, heaven is not a place, its the character of people living there. My parents pay substantial taxes and have been doing so for years, as a result I get flooded sewage water streets in my city, honour of being the 2nd most polluted city in the world, there is so much air pollution outside that I get asthma attacks breathing near roads due to dust. Potholes are more common than proper roads, asphalt on roads are wearing off, open drains throughout the city. State of govt buildings where govt officers work just sickens me as well, it feels like 1980s infra. Maybe they will just cross over to Bangladesh. OP whatever you wrote in this post, I was saying the same thing few months back. I was called ‘leftist’, ‘Liberandu’ , ‘Congressi’, anti-national and many more abuses were hurled at me. India is undergoing a downfall and the main reason is rampant corruption and population explosion. But if you criticise these things, people take it as an attack on their favourite government. When government is busy in promoting jingoistic hypernational narrative instead of focusing on basic issues like corruption, unemployment, climate change, law and order,what else do we expect? And pathetic losers fight tooth and nail in the comment section to defend their favourite party. When people will start putting India as priority rather than their favourite party/leader, then only there will be some scope for improvement. And looking at current state of affairs, India is doomed and so are Indians 😢 Yeah, because it holds up unlike airports in India No bro . Nobody's leaving People saying migrate as if that will solve the problem. People who support rape culture are also moving out of the country, so your problem just migrates with you. India’s problem is soon gonna be the world’s problem with everyone leaving. As a person living Canada. I have to disagree with two of your points: Healthcare and Taxes. Canada is known to have horrible healthcare. Not because of its lack of quality or because its expenses, but because of accessibility. In Canada you have free healthcare. But it’ll take you 2 weeks to get a doctors appointment. If you go to the ER, unless it’s life threatening they won’t attend to you immediately. That means, if you go with a broken arm and you’re in an insane amount of pain, they’ll make you suffer that pain for 12hours before they treat you. There have been so many news articles and posts here on Reddit about people dying in the waiting room after waiting for 15+ hrs. There’s no point in having free healthcare if it’s not accessible in the first place. India to me, seems to be doing much better in this case. It’s expensive in India for sure, but you’ll get treated pretty quickly. And Canada has ridiculous tax rates and housing prices. The good thing is that, I guess people in Canada can feel a little good because you get atleast something out of the tax money compared to nothing in India. Unfortunately I have to agree on this one I strongly believe India should get a development focused dictatorship. As much as we hate China we should really learn from them, obv apart from the non existent citizen rights 1. Because a large majority doesn’t care. 2. The Indian State is a separate, privatised entity formed without the participation of the people. then come back to vishwaguru india and expereince amritkaal here See bro the thing is people who are upper middle class can get quick diagnose by spending a hefty amount of money but for lower middle class which is still a big part of Indian society have to rely on government hospitals which are known for long waiting lines and worst service, bad infrastructure and the most govt. hospitals are filthy (from personal experience). So it's still same for us indians except rich can have good life. As for taxes, all countries are suffering from high taxes but atleast Canada gets something back in the name of development. I know it's not easy for you to live in canada alone and away from your family. God bless you Good points. Pretty happy here in Canada tbh. Every other point you mentioned makes life here better for me. Especially being away from our horrible society feel good. Current govt has just f.k this country.... everyone is frustrated be it youth, salaried, buisnessman no body knows what is there in future. Taxes r exponentially increasing day by day it's not a war situation. The fund for emergency is being used up , no clear picture of total debts by the corporate and on country from imf and world bank. Bullet train debt is also there. Logo ko ipl mei busy Kara hua hai. Dream11 jaise apps mei arabo ka satta chal raha hai. Hindu muslim mei log sab bhul gye hei.. Young generation belagaam kuch bhi kar Rahi h Bina uske consequences Jane. Drugs mei Sara future doob jayega. Army mei contract jobs hei. Artificial intelligence IT jobs kha jayega and India it sector in danger. No one knows future here. Rich after understanding all this just leaving country at any cost by dunki also. Sara stock market ek bubble hai ...sari growth fake hai on paper. Ganga clean.....smart cities.....pm care fund......petrol pr itna taxes...... income pr taxes..... indirect taxes......ye sara paisa kaha gya Abhi wait karo aur ye to trailer tha ... wealth tax... inheritance tax .... asset taxes are in lineup. Sarkar chahkar bhi tax kam ni kar sakti as the interest of debt on country is very huge.....defence budget mei kafi Paisa jata tha.... isliye agniveer laya gya....on same model....in every sector contractual jobs is in queue....no permanent jobs. Railway k daily accident kara rahe to make it private It's time to change the current government ...we r responsible for what is going on in this country.. Itna jyada scam hua hai....soch bhi ni sakte....jab new government aayegi....wo hi bata payegi....ya if u r smart then...taxes u r paying is basically a scam money....that u r paying back. Her cheez mei scam hai....neet ..upsc...gmat .... Sare mp mla ....upsc k through aane chahiye.....neta padhe likhe honge... padega India tabhi to badega India. Yup enjoy your life there. Struggle is everywhere, so it will be better to invest in a country that gives you back Canada is not taking Indians now. So it's better to become a Raja Ram Mohan Roy or ambedkar. Start making a difference instead of complaining. Go join politics Who said I'm going to Canada? And is there a place for honest politicians in this country. Your enemies will m*rder you if you will interfere with them. And I don't have leadership skills to be in politics. Toh baksh do hame, I just want live as a honest citizen The character of people rn here is very hard to change. The people here are liking medival methods. The progress done by the country in last 200yrs is all being erased Japan and Germany rebuilt themselves from the ashes of WW II in two generations. It was because of the character of their people and the pride for their country. We are fortunate that we live Ina democracy and we should be proud of that, as we should of the natural resources of our vast and diverse land. But in order to change India we have to change our thinking and every Indian needs to change that as well. We have come a long ways in many areas that we couldn't have imagined 20-30yrs ago but there is at least another generation or two's worth of work left. Look around us, they area bunch of failed states! We are the 3rd largest and growing economy. But the country needs STRONG LAW N ORDER ENFORCEMENT first and foremost and only then can talk progress be made. So figure out how we could start making that as the priority because in a democracy, if you don't have LAW enforcement, it quickly turns into a jungle rule which is what India feels like at times like today I am an NRI and while that's true you don't actually have to live in that part of town where Desis stay. You can stay 5 minutes away and have access to everything that OP wants without all the problems. Character of people my ass. I shouldn't have to be afraid that women in my family can be raped or killed because of the perverts dominating the society. People voted back the party which garlanded rapists and murderers. India is a hopeless place. what more do you expect from a downfall nation What a joke. China's model is an inspiration for no one. You will get a dictator like middle East or North Korea thousand times before you get a competent bastard. What bafoonery go live in a dictatorship country like Syria or North Korea first then talk what should be done. I'm neither leftist nor secular (ik it is controversial but plz ignore it for now). I'm not even muslim or Christian, I'm hindu and I don't support any particular party because all of them are ficking useless. We don't even have a good choice, in the name of leaders we only have old useless men. India is really doomed In China, women have the right to not get raped. “I am nepali, but does it matter?” That's your comment from 2 months ago. Listen here Nepali losser we have our own problems in our country but we will work through them. No Nepali losser has the right to write bafoonery like this. No.you should still be proud because if you say something about india which actually is right ,you are anti Indian. Ye kaise deshvhakti ki mansikta h logo ki. lmao What about ….. Hmm I just offended two guys. Let's see how many of them will get offended I don't know, I watched a Ted talk the other day where an Indian came out and called out all of his fellow Indians for dropping their rubbish and generally being pigs. As an Australian, we have a lot of Indians here and I don't feel they do that here. Sad but true India sucks cause of Sucky Indians. Sorry, but too many people with 3rd world attittude will turn those countries into shithole as well. what is your age ? Same feeling was with last govt., people brought this govt. with much hopes, no impact. Our society is fucked, no change of govt will do anything, unless there is some revolution. It is very well to say it is a collective problem but solving it is beyond any one human being. China's me too movement was suppressed by the party. Can't have discussion of harrasment in paradise. How can u say .....I m below 50..... congress has made this country.....all institutions.,...all psu....all banks .... What I don’t get is why does everyone want to leave to a wealthy nation? Why not Kenya? Or Mongolia? Or some place that’s not the top North America or Western Europe? It’s very akin to saying I want to have nothing to do with issues that a poorer economy brings and want to go somewhere that will help me be rich. Nothing wrong with this but this idea of upward mobility is everywhere. From villages to cities, from cities to a different country, from a random part of the new country to the best part of the new country….a bit of a rant but I was just speaking to a friend who was complaining about how she’s desperate to move from Iowa to northern cal as she’s tired of the ignorance and the lack of culture where she is. India was poorer than sub-saharan africa till 2015. That was also congress's doing. [https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/IND/SSQ](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC@WEO/IND/SSQ) When congress was voted out last time, India was being counted amongst fragile 5, due to high CAD and fiscal deficit, as well as relatively lower forex reserves. [https://www.bbc.com/news/business-24280172](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-24280172) The biggest problems that India faces today, are either because of fucked up societal norms (caste violence, gender violence, non compliance of traffic rules, littering) or because our governance structure is broken (no faith in judiciary; cases takes years; hence vigilantism, toothless city governance rendering cities unlivable, shitty labor and land laws, politicized police). None of them will be fixed by any political parties. \\*Look at the 'special achievements' of the Congress against all Hindu castes. Who says the Congress hasn't done 'anything' for 'Sanatan Hindus' in the last 65 years? They have done a lot, but only for their Muslim brothers...\\* \\*For example: They created Pakistan, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They created Bangladesh, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They implemented Article 370 in Kashmir, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They made the Minority Bill, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They created the Muslim Personal Law Board, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They established the Minority Affairs Ministry, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They created the Waqf Board, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They established Minority Universities, \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They partitioned India on religious grounds \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*They created the Places of Worship Act for Muslims?\\* \\*They made a law to seize donations from Hindu temples to run Muslim madrasas.\\* \\*They established the rule for subsidizing Hajj pilgrimage for Muslims.\\* \\*They introduced the Anti-Communal Violence Bill in Parliament for Muslims... but thanks to BJP, this Bill was not passed in Parliament. Congress brought this Bill again to pass it \"only for Muslims.\"\\* \\*And if this Bill had passed? It would have taken \"only 10 years\" to finish the Hindus...? If anyone has any doubt, they can search and read on Google.\\* \\*The Congress had a quiet plan to turn the country into an Islamic state and only give Hindus the 'lure of reservation' to keep them divided and fighting among themselves, so they could never understand the conspiracy of their Islamic conversion by Ghazwa-e-Hind...?\\* \\*To make Hindus second-rate citizens, they brought the Hindu Code Bill, also \"only for Muslims.\"\\* Indians are the richest diaspora in majority of countries outside of India...Look in the US Indians are the highest earners. Indians simply need a proper platform, opportunities to excel in. lol Indians are slowly turning into snowflakes one thing against it and their pride gets hurt and they get offended Do we expect the west to fix us, happened earlier too, it was called invasion. There is many reasons behind this why India is the way it is, from countless invasions, British Rule, Western meddling and interfering with our politicians/politics. Our neighbouring countries providing no support or partnership. Congress trying to turn India into a muslim state. Sardar Patel had the same vision for India as Mao did for China to turn into an Industrialist country, however he was sidelined and instead muslim/western puppets like Nehru/Gandhi were in charge who absolutely had no economic and industrial vision for India, they were muslims disguised as Indians and had no intention to develop the country. Now BJP only came into power in 2014 and still has done a lot more in the last 10 years than Congress has done for the last 70 now if you expect 100's of years of damage to be overturned over night, that is wishful thinking. However India is still doing better than majority of countries at the moment, but a bit ironic and hypocritical coming from Nepal which is in a much worse state? Either way not the point, if you look at Western countries currently UK/Canada/America the citizens of those countries are absolutely dreading being there as the rise in costs, unemployment and basic living costs are unbearable while LGTBQ/Trans agenda is in full effect in schools, there is a complete retardation of society happening in the western world. The grass is not greener on the other side if you that's what you think, but you are more than free to leave no one is stopping you. You don't really have to get rilled up for no reason. By your logic we can see the democracies like Bangaladesh and Sri Lanka we all know what is hapening there. Take an example of Singapore it has an authoritarian government and it's doing pretty good. Bafoonery is when a large masses of people are communalized and influenced to vote for hate and not actual development and security. The \"competent bastards\" that we have got here have thrown this country and its people to the dogs. So good luck with your so called democracy It’s not about expecting the West to fix us, but rather about recognizing the potential within our community and the benefits of leveraging opportunities to excel. Indian's never get a proper infrastructure or platform to excel, due to various reasons which yes one of them is invasions. Only if Sardar Patel had become the first prime minister he had the same vision for India as Mao had for China to turn into an industrialist state and an economic power house however he got sidelined and instead western puppets/stooges Nehru/Gandhi came into power who instead did the complete opposite. Yes I do. Because people like you are advocating for dictatorship. And why don't you use European countries as another example for damn democracy? No? Doesn't serve your agenda? Sure democracy has it's downfalls just like every damn system but dictatorship is much much worse. And the fact you can sit here and discuss critize and wonder which system would be better is thanks to democracy. Shree Lanka like there aren't million issues going on and has a history of dictatorship. Bangladesh like hasina didn't broken down the democracy and has been a dictator for 15 years? Some examples you have chosen here what next look at the democratic republic of Korea? Or Russia with it's foolproof elections? The fact of the matter is. You have no idea what stupidity you are advocating for. I can confirm this about Canada. Not much difference due to people's bad attitude even after moving there. Lot of societal baggage that they still carry. I'm not nepali, that was just a lie to be anonymous, at that time unhygienic food videos was on trend and I didn't want to be questioned about it, that's why I mentioned it. You don't have to put other countries in picture when we our talking about our country. And thank you for your warning Your literally mentioning leaving India because of it's poor condition, and the countries I listed are the majority where most Indian's go to, why would I not give you a picture of whats happening in those countries if you decide to go there? This is how a discussion works.... > has nothing to offer except fake patriotism. Govt instead of doing its job , is manufacturing and selling this boatloads. Its supporters are happy for this/ Still Indians are very successful around the world. The Indian hardworking and discipline is first class. I want to leave Yes Indians follow all rules all over the world except in India. They won't spit paan in america but they will do in India. Their civic sense just disappears in India. Unfortunately Indians don't respect their own land, that's my concern. Not how much they are earning around the world. I meant about nepal. Your other opinions I'm not rejecting it If you're leaving, why post here? Just leave. And in the meanwhile, also please post what you did to \"change\" \"people around you\" and got tired of. If it's useful data, we, the people of India who \"suck\", will atleast use it to improve our lives in this country. Or is your way to \"change\" people around you as lame and superficial and non-data backed and as useless as this cheapshot post is? Ok so first of all don't be triggered, try to take criticism. Many people even my friends throw their garbage on roads instead of garbage when it is right beside them. Their reasoning? \"Ek ke karne se kya hoga, kachra to tab bhi bahar he hai na, mujhe gyan mat de\". This is just one scenario, I pointed out many things and their reasons are same. And why shouldn't I tell the reasons before leaving India? You guys are the only ones who ask later why so many educated Indians are leaving when India has so much to offer? > I thought I would die for India and NRIs are the dumbest people on earth Well, you're not wrong in thinking NRIs are dumb. Most of them are the most patriotic 'Indians' you'll meet and are brainwashed about the country and progress, yet they'd never live there. Says it all really. > Canada is not taking Indians now who said that? the floodgates are still open to kaneda. Sucks what? Which city? Want to develop India? Vote for accountability, BJP should have lost election after demonetisation, dint happen. This is embarrassing. Please pack your bags and leave as soon as it's humanely possible. Lmao as expected😂 🙌 Indians in general abroad already are making a bad name by not giving a F about the host culture, attitude etc. So, now we know the root cause is not the babus or politicians. Politicians are representative of a us. Now who to blame?l harsh punishment will solve the problems. As a Turk I can see that the 21st century will be the Indian century. Modi ko hatao desh ko bachao. i am not from india, but i can feel your emotions. you are 100% correct, dont live for the country, live for your self and take care of your self. not the country, it will stay forever there baap ki zameen and nobody will take care of it. so go out, any enjoy your life. Not really check the Olympic results I mean is there even a genuine solution to all this ? All the people who have similar thoughts are too stupid and blind to accept that they themselves are also the part of the problem. BS Look at what we did to Brampton 😭😭 Unless we are willing to integrate in a foreign society.. we should not move there. I feel you. Not surprisingly I had the same viewpoint when I left India more than a decade ago. Seems not a lot has changed in the last 10yrs. India may or may not change, either way India likely wont become as good as a developed nation in all aspects in our lifetime. So I don’t see the problem of moving to a place that can provide a better life I agree with you, sadly... Corrupt, blind & deaf politicians Not hardworking population Cheap labour Employees working low on wages Insta scrolling youth the decades old reservation system (just increasing it) Illegal immigrants Unplanned development Pro china neighbouring countries Drastically increasing population Dry law & order Hatred between communities & states Privatisation (it has both pros and cons) Vishwaguru for a reason, easier to preach than practice! Vision 2047 by Modi 😁 i used to think jayant bhandari is piece of shit, now its hard to refute his points they dont have the guts to do it in a country with strict laws It will take time. We are growing at 7 to 8% growth every year. We need to keep that momentum going for 30-40 years. If we can do that, India will see a lot of progress. But for that to happen, we need to focus on education, strengthening our legal system, making our country business friendly, continue investing heavily in infrastructure which this government is doing. Well ask about an odd one out, so which city isn't like this? Good leave. Nobody wants people like you to stay. I agree with you 100%, India is a shithole all the more reason to stay and the fight the good fight Par tujhe visa Kaun dega har ik country ne immigration bohat strict ki hoi hai Is it possible to leave and form your own country? (Selective people Ofcourse) Can we collectively try finding solutions? (For ourselves first, maybe?) DO NOT GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY THERE IS ENOUGH OF YOU EVERYWHERE imagine calling for responsibility while also saying you're leaving. ironic isn't it. Couple more mandirs and statues will fix all your problems, just wait and see This is a very good point. Indians keep harping back to the British era atrocities. No doubt they were atrocities and we were looted. But it has been 67 years since independence. Japan and Germany were destroyed and came back stronger. It's interesting how there are a lot of Indians in the US and Canada, yet the attitudes towards Indians in the 2 countries is so starkly different This is true! Everyone is ready to leave India if one gets any opportunity. There is a guy on you called acharya Prashant he has made a detailed analysis you can watch that to understand the problem more deeply and he also gives a plan of action These all r paper lines.....jab ye govt jayegi....tab bhi ...paper lines hi milengi....kyuki ......no country is ideally running....but u can show the plus to praise it or show negative for downvote. plz write properly, its not legible. and here i am trying to escape NorCal.. circle of like. :D U can't understand Hindi How much money did America pour in Germany after WW2 again? And how much money did UK give as reparitions to India? Mentality. You. Cannot. Change. The. Mentality. Of. Indian. People. 100% true... Indians are rich in the West. They work very hard, but very soon their, culture, religion, and politics, holds them back and this creates great personal dysfunction. So what happens? In one or two decades kids and entire families adopt Western ways, morals, and attitudes. They leave Old India behind never to return. If they do, they build mini-western oriented organizations or companies in India and hire people trained abroad. They travel often. If only they gave Gold Medals for Embarrassment on the World Stage, India would be a winner... You do have to pass the Exam. The Oligarchs are getting rich. Peoples live are not improving. > do ten to twenty years of hard work to climb the job ladder, survive the weather, and learn to appreciate housing costs, utility bills, and taxes are very high. all these things true literally everywhere in the world. but some places still give you a good environment Every place gives you a chance. Why the hell, not India? for paying high taxes in india, i don't get social services, good quality roads, people with civic sense, etc etc. it's a long list. India DOESN'T suck in healthcare. It's the best Healthcare system in the world. I Nah you are wrong. Indians are successful everywhere in the world, I agree but not every Indian in the US is a successful rich guy. The ones who are successful are shown on social media, the ones who are not successful, are not shown. yah no shit? This is not a 12 year old argument obviously not every person will be successful wether indian or not. we are talking MAJORITY, and this is nothing to do with social media wtf are you talking about. This is based on stats, data, a census bureau.... [https://www.firstpost.com/world/indians-are-top-earners-in-the-us-even-ahead-of-americans-china-pakistan-miles-behind-11994502.html](https://www.firstpost.com/world/indians-are-top-earners-in-the-us-even-ahead-of-americans-china-pakistan-miles-behind-11994502.html) as if your ilk would be allowed to enter an airport is that your life's achievement? taking an international flight? 😭 Bro everyone wants what you want. Every country has a problem. No country would develop if everyone leaves. When India was in colonial rule, would you think the same ? Politicians are same in all countries. Roma people are still suffering in Europe. Recently their homes were demolished. And you don't have to be politicians to make a change in a country. You can join NGO too that help educate poor kids, help elderly, divorced women, or people suffering from mental issues. I don't know where you come from, India is a large and diverse place. Some places are developed whereas some are underdeveloped. Go to kochi or Mysore or Pune or Hyderabad or Chandigarh. You just want a easy life, even if you have to suck up to your white masters. Far right in every country will hate you and far right is increasing every country."
