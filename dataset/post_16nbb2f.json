        "The math problems in themselves are quite straightforward. However, the language around it might be challenging for a 4th grader.\n\nBut hey, that's how the Indian education system has worked for many years.\n\nYou can probably help her with some que cards for her exams, which allows her to identify if she needs to perform multiplication or division. I used this trick extensively while solving H.C.F. and L.C.M. questions.",
        "If you really want to know, take the opportunity at the next PTM to find out where your kid stands in the class, percentile-wise, subject-wise. \n\nBut this is a good opportunity to tell your kid (and yourself) that if he can't do some questions, its OK. If he can't be a topper, that's OK. The goal should be to perform at his maximum potential, just compete with himself. This is a far more important lesson than some math.  \n\nAnd, by the way, the answer to question 4 on Page 2 is \"none of the above\". The correct answer is 759.",
        "Thanks for the tips, am trying to help her in my best way.",
        "Nope you are wrong",
        "Hey, thanks for your advice! The school doesnâ€™t listen to parents during PTMs; instead, they enforce that the child has to attend remedial classes. When I asked how other kids perform or answer such complex questions, they simply said that 3-4 kids can answer them. I just wanted to focus on the 26th question, part (vi), which is very tricky for a child who has just learned multiplication. I never force or push my child to compete with others. I always encourage and support her potential, and my wife tries creative ways to practice.",
        "If just 3-4 kids in the class can answer the difficult questions, then you're OK. It's probably some shitty ploy to get kids into those remedial classes, and make more money thereby.   \n\nAs someone else mentioned, the difficulty in these questions is not the math part, but the English comprehension. If your daughter is not already doing it, this is a good time to get her into the reading habit (in fact right now is the perfect time: after 2-3 years she'll be stuck on the smartphone and won't listen to you). If you can get her hooked onto reading English novels appropriate for her age, her English comprehension will automatically improve, and more importantly get her into a habit that will last her a lifetime.",
        "I think the question itself is easy considering it's simple multiplication for class 4, but to understand the question requires reading comprehension skills beyond the scope of class 4, but then again I've seen kids nowadays speak fluent english..So maybe it's not?"
