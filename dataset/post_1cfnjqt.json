There are also decent girls who are vulnerable and in love and are duped by men under the pretense of marriage. Now the last part- yes women can also take advantage of men by making fake promises and the law can Technically put that clause in....BUT the fact remains that women are more vulnerable and subject to stigma if they have past physical relationships than men (case in point: You and your perspective), plus losing virginity is a big thing especially in this culture for women and it is still CHECKED in a large strata of society (iykwim). The repercussions of such an act are MUCH higher for women than men.",

My question is then why is a woman indulging in pre marital sex even if it's based on pretext of marriage ? After all the society is conservative.  You might say that a woman is free to do whatever she wants to. It's her body. Totally agree. But this contradicts the fact that indian society is conservative. You don't pick and choose the assumption of conservative society. \n\nAnd like you said, if a woman backs down from relationship then why can't men claim rape.",

        "If “resisting” was a prerequisite, then raping an unconscious person wouldn’t be rape. There are many forms of rape that don’t have additional violence tacked on: drugging someone, statutory rape, and indeed, uninformed consent. To help you see it in a less gendered way: if a woman said she is infertile to a man who didn’t want kids, and he agrees to sex only because of that, then he was raped. The only nugget of sense in your post is that rape laws should be gender-neutral.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the modernized liberated Indian woman you describe is a minority in real life, even if she is a majority online. While women’s lives everywhere have improved, gender segregation is still common outside major urban centers and among the less educated. So a large population still has an unhealthy relationship with sex, leading to a transactional dynamic around it.",

But, there are many women who wouldn't have sex if marriage wasn't promised. Why??? \n\nBecause women have an expiration date on having a child. Men can go on having a child until they are 80. The chances of getting pregnant. Men's fascination with a virgin women(even when they have bodycount in 40-60 range). \n\nAlso, a serious committed relationship usually means a promise of marriage. Now, if you(guys) broke up for whatever reason, it's over, obviously. \n\nNot everyone is a part of the hookup culture just because they are dressing modern.

Theres a taboo around talking about intimacy. And women are kept particularly ignorant about it. Im talking about the economically lower class as well as the rural people specifically. So when they meet a guy, fall in love (or at least think they are in love) often times they are pressured into it. And the most common reasoning used is \"anyway we will get married, so what difference does it make if we do it now or then\". This is apart from thebusual \"dont you love me\" and the fear of losing the person she loves.\nWomen are also creatures of desire. But we are also bound by \"being a Virgin for marriage\" and \"family honour \" so this sounds like a good compromise. \nThen the guy turns out to be false and the woman who still believes that she must be and is expected to be a virgin for her marriage is at a loss because who will marry her now?\nIts not as simple as saying yes.

And women have these thoughts internalised which is why many of them consider their virginity precious and to be lost only to their 'true love ' or life partner. \n\n> My question is then why is a woman indulging in pre marital sex even if it's based on pretext of marriage ?\n\nCould be because she wants to have sex like an average person in a relationship or because she has a boyfriend who manipulated her into engaging in it in the pretext of breaking up etc\n\n> But this contradicts the fact that indian society is conservative.\n\nNo it doesn't because the woman would want to keep it private because she knows the shaming game that'll happen. The conservative society attacks as soon as/only when it gets to know about the sex.\n\n> The current law basically takes away any accountability from a woman and assumes that they are gullible enough to fall victim to such scenarios so often that they need a legal recourse.\n\nHonestly I don't like that many women agree to sex under the pretext of marriage. I don't like that many of them tie their worth to their virginity. But if that is the reality and if many of them do get affected by such incidents then shouldn't they be protected by laws? Stupid actions don't have to be protected by law. But these girls don't simply have such notions in their mind, they are planted by how the society acts around them so it's not their stupidity. \n\nAlso, being gullible is not a matter of intelligence imo. It's about exposure. And Indian women generally have less exposure. I'm glad that the proportion of such women is going down and hopefully in the future (idk how we can decide when) we won't need such laws because of the change in mentality of the people and the women.",

But if a man lies to have sex and the woman agrees to have sex then she made an adult decision to have sex. If she feels that she can't put her 'chastity' at risk, then it's on her to say no and not succumb to bodily pleasures.

        "I think this is a matter of the OP (and most people) seeing things differently. I will try to provide my two cents. \n\nIf somebody doesn't wish to engage in sexual activities unless they are getting married to the other person, the other person shouldn't even try coerce the person in question by hook or crook. If they do coerce the person in question, it should be labelled as rape, because you are engaging in that activity without complete consent of the person in question. Please note that I mentioned complete consent, since the consent is given only when there is promise of marriage.\n\nYou can point out that it could be a case of deceiving rather than rape. To that I would say, in my opinion, if somebody invades somebody else's personal space by any means, gets intimate with them in a false pretext, it should amount to a harsher crime than simply deceiving. If we were to compare the two offenses, I believe rape holds more weight than simply deceiving them. Hence, if somebody's intimacy is taken advantage of, or their personal space is invaded without their complete consent, it should be judged as rape rather than deceiving, since the crime is just that egregious.\n\nIf you were to say that, \"people are becoming more modern, more western, they engage in sex with anybody at all,\" I would mention that, yes, people are more open towards sex, but WITH THE PERSON THEY COMPLETELY CONSENT TO. This consent must be mutual and open. People do have sex with others without the prospect of marriage and it is absolutely fine if all the people involved are okay with it. Some people consent to having sex without the promise of marriage, others consent to having sex only with the promise of marriage. It is their right.\n\nFinally coming to the point of false cases, yes they do exist. It would be ignorant of me not to acknowledge that. But that is why courts exist. So that they can fight it out legally and the truth of the matter is brought forward. I am not going into the skewdness or the biasness of the law in question, since I believe that shouldn't be a metric to judge whether a law is implemented. But that is a separate discussion altogether, I simply wanted to talk about what people do and do not consider rape.\n\nThank you for reading through this, and I would love to read through some of your opinions, as long its respectful and not simply childish name-calling.",

        "Here is what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_deception) says:\n\n\"Rape by deception is a situation in which the perpetrator deceives the victim into participating in a sexual act to which they would otherwise not have consented, had they not been deceived. Deception can occur in many forms, such as illusory perceptions, false statements, and false actions.\"\n\nThis is not as black and white as the non-consensual sex rape and does need to be taken case by case.\n\nIn your example, it can be considered rape because had it not been for the promise of getting the role, the aspiring actor would not have slept with the producer, especially if the producer knew when they were promising the role and having sex that they would, in fact, not be giving the role to the aspiring actor (which can be hard to prove). However, in this case, it might be easier to prove rape by coercion than rape under false pretense, but I digress. It cannot really be equated to prostution because in prostution, in the end, the transaction is completed when the prostitute gets paid.\n\nThe same can be said about someone lying about their age to get sex, especially if the person lying is a minor. This then becomes a rape under false pretense vs statutory rape case which can go either way based on evidence provided.\n\nIn another case, if a couple are having sex under the assumption that they will be getting married in the future but later break up, that, in general, cannot be considered rape because it is assumed that bother parties didn't lie when they promised to get married ([Source](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-warns-against-misusing-rape-laws-in-failed-relationship-cases-emphasizes-consent-and-consequences-101692641360835.html)).\n\nAgain, all of this is very nuanced and no one can make a blanket statement of whether it is right or wrong.",

So, if a couple has sex, either of them can force the other to participate in a marriage? This is utterly ridiculous. This law is nonsense.",

If you consumed morphine you were unable to exercise your choice over whether to consume that morphine or not . Or exercise your choice over your consumption of morphine in your body . I tell you to drink that morphine and in return I give you reward . You were able to exercise your choice over the consumption of  morphine in your body . \nNow if the task of consuming morphine was a service or you faced loss because of it and it is rightful to expect a reward for it . It is called the theft or service . You were able to exercise full consent or the power to say yes or no over the glass . Whether nor not it is consensual is determined by whether not the parties where able to exercise their consent over the ACT not once you exercise your consent over the act some reward will be given or not . Lets take a prostitute who was not given money in return for her services. Here you were able to exercise your consent over the acts to be done on you , you were allowed to exercise your consent over things related to your body . You were not able to choose or did not choose the situation where you would be cheated out of your reward or something in return for that . You can say your reward was taken from you and you had no choice in the matter of getting or not getting the reward . Then comes the fact if he is liable to pay you a reward for whatever you did .",
        "The example you mentioned about infertility no that still is not rape , sexual assault is if any acts were done to you without your agency or without you choosing them . Stealthing is rape because you are removing a condom and that act becomes a different act . An act which is different to what was said was performed on you . Rape on pretext of marriage or gifts is not rape , if it was it would be a law in most developed countries it is a more similar law to seduction which existed in victorian england ."

    "light_cleaned_title": "rape on false pretext of marriage",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "whats this nonsense concept? do lawmakers consider women to be less intelligemt that adult women cant make their choices? and if the sex is consensual how can it be termed rape? and if u say because it is lying and cheating....so why the case registered is rape...it could be of lying and cheating....but lets consider for one momekt ok...its right... them why not men can also file such things if women lie before being intimate.? And are they blind to the recent changes in society and way of living of girls...our society is going western...so how can they bring up such a law? The law could be logical for the PAST INDIA. The country where women panicked when their dupatta slided....the same country now women are wearing hot pants... The country were women even shied away after listening the word sex...now live in live in relationships,engage in premarital sex...and there is a rise in hookup culture SO many things have changed...and so should lawmakers update themselves with and come with laws that are revelevant to present society rather than the past society. WHY ARE OUR LAWMAKER LIVING IN THE PAST?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Contrary to your opinion, women are a part of vulnerable sections of the society, yes, good morning. Sexual violence against women is a sad reality of human society. Many women are promised marriages and are swayed or pressured into having sex on the basis of the same. Moreover the penal provision only applies if at the time of sex, consent was obtained without serious consideration of marriage. u cannot wiegh millions on same scale.... second....the onus lies on the man to prove he did not prmise marriage...how the hell can it be proven? Bro came to know about gynocentric Indian laws in 2024... \"GENDER BIASED\" \"gender unequalty\" Consent obtained thru force or coercion is still not considered enthusiastic consent. This is not just in India but also in other countries. Had the other person known there was no intention of marriage, would the girl give consent? Nope. The terms under which the consent was given has changed, therefore its non consensual. Just like how stealthing is also rape. I don’t have any problem with this law, however my only objection is why this applies only to men. What if a woman lied about marrying? Your coloured vision is not ready for discussion rather you’re looking for confirmation. lop no point to debate..so lets try to divert it by saying something demeaning seems like u dont know about gurls....have u ever seen a gurl? then u would know that gurls have casual sex too Seems like you didn’t understand what I said lmao seems like u r confused and write something else Ok if u understood, can you reiterate what I said? Had the other person known there was no intention of marriage, would the girl give consent? \"YES\" AUSE GURLS ALSO ENGAGE IN CASUAL SEX...OR SEX IN LIVE IN OR SEX IN BF GF SETUP.. Bhahaha. You definitely didn’t understand shit. How did you just assume “YES”? It could be a ‘yes’ IN WHICH CASE THIS LAW DOESNT APPLY. Or it could be a “NO”, in which case THIS LAW SHOULD BE APPLIED. Not al ‘gurls’ are like this. Go outside teir 1-2 cities and you’ll realise. ya but i was talking about only the girls who r like thus...i never said anything about laws related to rral rape Wow so the parliament should make different laws for urban and rural rape? Bas kar bhai if i never mentioned about marriage ..hiw can u assume i had intention to marry u...thus file rape on false pretext of marriage Consensual sex is not rape...either rural or urban Are u havjng sex with ur own will.If yes...its consensual...it cannot be termed rape And terms of that consent were based on a lie (pretext of getting married) that consent is VOID. Simple concept. Bruh you’re just a fucking teen who wants to keep arguing online even after losing it. Get off Reddit and do something productive on a Monday morning. As for your futile rebuttal, this law only applies if the man has literally promised on record that he will marry. If the woman as simply ‘assumed’, it won’t be rape. lol thats only an indian thing...no western country has this illogical concept of law. if i didnt mention anything about marriage how come the rape on false pretext is executed against me. and are girls dumb according to u...who dont have discretion? if at the time of sex ...u agreed..its consensual... rape is when sex is physically forced...dont add ur definitions into it u should step in courts some day..or atleast read about the proceedings...rather than just being like a kid and assjming everything is alright and even if he promises marriage its not \"Rape\".... if u r so concerned about ur \"PURITY\"...dont engage in \"PREMARITAL CONSENSUAL SEX\" ...no western contry has such concept... u should step in courts some day..or atleast read about the proceedings...rather than just being like a kid and assjming everything is alright and even if he promises marriage its not \"Rape\".... if u r so concerned about ur \"PURITY\"...dont engage in \"PREMARITAL CONSENSUAL SEX\" ...no western contry has such concept... Stop looking to the west for validation. If you didn’t mention about marriage, then this law does not apply to you, you stud. They are not, but many there are many cases where the girl only slept with the guy because guy lied and led her to believe that he would marry her. After sex he vanishes. This is the specific problem the law tries to address. Force can be mental or emotional also, as in the above case. Go read. Why not have it apply to both genders equally then? Bruh you effed up bad, just give up instead of changing the topic now. If you’ve read about court proceedings, give me one example in which a man was found guilty of rope on false pretext of marriage without adequate proofs/ witness hearings? lol..its ur body ..u better not be in premarital sex...if u care about ur \"Purity: our society is going western...so adapt to it...cant have western society and have laws according to indian values. My man, if the marriage consideration was a false pretext, the 'consent' becomes null and void because it was conditional...once the condition is removed, it is coercion, hence not real consent. You keep saying women wear shorts and have casual sex etc...do you have any data proving these are the same women filing rape cases under this scenario? There are also decent girls who are vulnerable and in love and are duped by men under the pretense of marriage. Now the last part- yes women can also take advantage of men by making fake promises and the law can Technically put that clause in....BUT the fact remains that women are more vulnerable and subject to stigma if they have past physical relationships than men (case in point: You and your perspective), plus losing virginity is a big thing especially in this culture for women and it is still CHECKED in a large strata of society (iykwim). The repercussions of such an act are MUCH higher for women than men. yes there r. find it.. and even it was promised marriage its not rape.... no western country has such concept.our society is going western...so adapt to it...cant have western society and have laws according to indian values. CONSENSUAL SEX CANNOT BE TERMED RAPE. PEACE How about men don’t lie about their intentions before sticking it in? Hookup culture is a tiny tiny faction of indian society. Most people still don’t even know the basics about sexual freedom— like you :) Go read. Sex is not used for creating a bond contract lmao. If you're unsure don't have it. If you're forced then it's not sex and it's rape. But if there was sex that's just sex, it doesn't magically change to rape when things don't go your way. This is why education is important Bud has no single case to prove his point and asks me to “step in courts someday”. Do you have a brain?? Have you heard of a brain??? If you had you’d use it sometimes lol come out of ur home and see the real world...from villages to urban all are going western the marriage part was the knvention of our people. it isnt in west. it was our invention seeing our indian culture. our society is going western...so adapt to it...cant have western society and have laws according to indian values. Doesn't happen overnight...mentality doesn't change because western culture is gaining SOME acceptance here. This is a diverse country and it will take a LONG time for the mentality and cultural beliefs to come to terms with it. ROME Wasn't built in a DAY Disclaimer - I’m NRI and consider myself pretty much American in my mindset. This thought process is so non sensical, I don’t even know where to begin. Women are free to make bad choices, like men. Are they saying it’s illegal to either tell lies to your loved ones or change your mind about marrying a particular person. What baloney. thank god a sensible person on reddit Sex is an act in which two people participate. Why is a women's chastity considered more important than a man's chastity ? You might say that it's bcz of a result of a conservative Indian society. Ok let's agree on that assumption. My question is then why is a woman indulging in pre marital sex even if it's based on pretext of marriage ? After all the society is conservative. You might say that a woman is free to do whatever she wants to. It's her body. Totally agree. But this contradicts the fact that indian society is conservative. You don't pick and choose the assumption of conservative society. And like you said, if a woman backs down from relationship then why can't men claim rape. India is a transitioning society. yes it's going towards western society, but that's only for urban 10% population. Reality of 90% women population from rural India is far away from any freedom or empowerment. even rual india has live in relatiosnhip nowadays and they enagae in premarital sex..going against their parents.. This makes sex transactional. There's consideration on each side, the girl would agree to sex because there's promise of marriage? It's akin to the law reducing girls to prostitutes which are not getting their promised payment. Ridiculous. If “resisting” was a prerequisite, then raping an unconscious person wouldn’t be rape. There are many forms of rape that don’t have additional violence tacked on: drugging someone, statutory rape, and indeed, uninformed consent. To help you see it in a less gendered way: if a woman said she is infertile to a man who didn’t want kids, and he agrees to sex only because of that, then he was raped. The only nugget of sense in your post is that rape laws should be gender-neutral. It is also worth mentioning that the modernized liberated Indian woman you describe is a minority in real life, even if she is a majority online. While women’s lives everywhere have improved, gender segregation is still common outside major urban centers and among the less educated. So a large population still has an unhealthy relationship with sex, leading to a transactional dynamic around it. If marriage is on the card then women and men both should abstain. Tell the guy to marry first. You wouldn't do that with any other personal asset. Why do that with your biggest and most valuable asset, your body? well the majority of women u said dont engage in premarital sex.... and if they do consensual rape cannot be called rape.... there is no such concept as rape on pretext of marriage in west... even if they lie their profession and all..they r charged with fraud a..not rape.. Live in relationship in villages! Have you ever stepped out of your city? And do you really ask for permission from your parents for everything you do? Its not really consensual if your consent was entirely based on the fact that the man said he will marry you. When he didn’t, the consent became invalid. Its that simple… \" please girl we are gonna marry anyway , bas thoda sa krne do , how do i know you love me? you don't even give yourself to me , arey baba we will marry na toh why are you scared ,tum meri hi ho bas kapde utaro \" the amount of manipulation that goes into getting into naive girl's pants is unimaginable. and many of times these women are coerced into it thro fake promises of marriage. it's not bullshit bc you haven't gone through it. well yes u should visit villages some day....well if they dont..these laws never effect them.. if majority of women who dont engage in premarital sex...then these shojkd not affect them ghe gurl has full option to deny and file harrasment case. if she chooses to sleep its not rape... if ithis law was a right thing then other countrues would have also had it ur logoc is only limited to india...nobosy else would validate it...cause u r talking according to indian culture which is diminishing here itself in india just say \"No\" if u care tok much about purity >If u r so concerned about ur \"PURITY\" Dont engage in \"PREMARITAL CONSENSUAL SEX The same goes otherwise too! If you're sooo worried about your so called legal safety, then why are you indulging in pre marital sex? You cant have both things at the same time. A law is always made after seeing the situations. A country like India which keeps the honor on women's vagina needs such law. Honor killing happens because of this. Multiple women were used (in men's vocab) and were shamed by the society. None of the other men schooled or stopped these exploitation themselves, hence the government took a stand. You're seeing the urban section which is modernised and dont generalise that to entire India. All the female biased laws today are a result of the ruthless attrocities of men, yesterday. Call it karma or whatever. Cry about it. alot of countries dont have strong child rape laws so are we justifying w that example too now? dumn comparison. i said it's not exactly rape it's coercion , now you might wanna search up how naive are manipulated into doing stuff but let's not get into \" file harassment \" \" do xyz you've so many options\" going to the police for such matters has always been a taboo thing in most villages. U lived ur whole life in tier 1 cities? As u said in past that would make sense too?,step out bruh! well ur rural wlmen dont engage in premarital sex..so it would not affect them.... Its not? Its illegal in India cause Indian men consider women who have had pre-marital sex impure, so them having sex impacts their image in society. This doesn’t happen abroad. Some guy comes along, lies about marrying, and destroys the girls reputation by actively MANIPULATING her into having sex. I don’t see the problem with that being rape, the consent was acquired through coercion/manipulation. but I think you’re too immature to understand women’s problems. u do know about christians abroad? Kid, first learn to frame proper sentences. Or talk in Hindi rather brutally murdering English. well ur tier 2 and tier 3 city girls dont engage in premarital sex so this shoukd nog affect them...if they do..then they r following western culture...so western rukes for western culture well another english superiority person.... well m not writing some things to a highly renowned person that i will type carefully talk about west I hear you but why women are entertaining such men in the first place. We live in a society where most of the men want to have sex what ever the circumstances may be and they lie to get sex. We should punish them undoubtedly. But in some cases it’s being used as a weapon, cases when a woman wants to take revenge for breakup etc, which is should not happen. This is exactly why they need that law. As idea of Live in relationship is big no in rural area, men manipulate women to have premarital sex by giving false hope of marriage, otherwise they don't give consent to it. Then they leave when it's done, but women suffer social consequences for having sex before marriage. You came here just to prove your false notion. Next what? Caste discrimination is becoming less in cities nowadays, so scrap SC/ST act?? See the edit. If not English, type in Hindi. I'm just telling you to write full sentences so that the other person can understand your thoughts well if u follow indian culture...u will say no... if u are manipulated or attracted to west...u will engage in sex...so western rules for western actions How do you prove if the sex was consenual? Women are never clear about what they want. what part did u not understand? they want the best part of both west and indian culture. sorry no...u can follow only one culture... act west and then expect indian treatment...nonsense.. village women dony engage in premarital sex? LMAO BOY what a joke. speak for your village ig bc most of ours very well do. youd find 100 revenge porn of young village women. many of them repeatedly sayinh dony record while the guy keeps saying \" mai hi toh dekhunga \" pls sir you can deny shit for only as long. and UK does not of rape laws for men so ig you're supporting that too? Keep living in delusion op medical...and police and courts have many methods.... one example i saw in a case was:The girl clicked pictures happily after sex...went on fate...was captured on camera living to the fullest Dis you read the comment above which I Had edited? I clearly mentioned first two paras. And first tell your age. maybe i would consider u to come out of delusion sorry there were so many comments i got confused Op is just an incel. An illiterate one at that too. He's not able to comprehend what the law says. And is harping about how girls have casual sex when that's not even the premise of the law. The law clearly states the context in which this law applies. There are many men on marriage apps who are there only for hookups. They promise that they will get married, have sex to check compatibility and then ghost. All this being said, the law needs to consider both genders. Lol just look at this pathetic comment section trying to justify this stupid law which probably only exists in our country. This pretext of marriage law is just asking to be misused. Just because there is an understanding between the boy and the girl about marriage doesn't mean that the girl has an entitlement about marriage. Things happen in life and there can be so many reasons why relationships don't work out. This law considers virginity of an woman to be pure but what about the man then? Well men's right doesn't matter in India. I am not even the going to tell that the laws should be gender neutral because laws like this shouldn't even exist in the first place People should know the circumstances under which they consent to sex. You might consent to having sex with someone under the circumstance that it is in the bedroom and completely private but that person records you and uploads the video of you to the internet. Despite the sex being consensual, it is still rape since you didn't consent to having your video taken. You still didnt answer my simple question. nor do indian have.... if the gurl was saying no..it was not consensual..it is rape.. .we were not talking about these cases to begin with.. Your English isn't the problem. Your assumptions are the main problem. Stop being a child. There are no 'western rules'. By western rules, you mean the great hookup culture, that you seem to be a part of. No judgement but stop pushing your agenda, as well. Yes, people from everywhere in India, men and women included, like casual sex. But, there are many women who wouldn't have sex if marriage wasn't promised. Why??? Because women have an expiration date on having a child. Men can go on having a child until they are 80. The chances of getting pregnant. Men's fascination with a virgin women(even when they have bodycount in 40-60 range). Also, a serious committed relationship usually means a promise of marriage. Now, if you(guys) broke up for whatever reason, it's over, obviously. Not everyone is a part of the hookup culture just because they are dressing modern. Many still believe that they can see sex as a pleasure and just that. And there are many, even in tier 1 cities, who won't have sex unless marriage is in the cards, for sure. nowhere we r talking about such scenarios...recordjng is definitely criminal Wow op seems super mad today, seems like this post is personal?! 🤣 Another person who doesn't realize that rape laws aren't gender neutral because of patriarchy. Stop bashing the system that you've created If the person consents to being recorded, it is not criminal. If the person doesn't know that they're being recorded, it is criminal. Lol Indian culture. The so called great culture that forces women to marry and have sex with a complete stranger without her consent. That's why even Marital Rape laws should be implemented. Maybe you should ask men not follow western culture and keep fucking around. someone clearly doesn't know about coercion. i suggest you look it up before being a internet warrior. its not as simple as you make iy out to be. Even if there is intention of marriage, people have problems in their lives, relationships don't work out. If somebody doesn't want to marry you, you can't just force the other person.The law shouldn't be gender neutral, the law should not exist those who dont engae in premarital sex...would not have bother from this...tho who engage....if its consenits not rape... Do you have data to claim that 'rural wlmen dont engage in premarital sex'? When you say west, which countries are you referring to? Also, you do realise that there are lots of laws that do not exist in west, but in India and vice versa. You shouldn't be comparing. ya implement maritale rape law...and also remove the biased laws against men according to western standards OP, use the internet to educate yourself. To the people saying \"the girl is also involved, she shouldnt have pre marital sex\" We as a country dont talk to our children about relationships. About sex. Or about love. Theres a taboo around talking about intimacy. And women are kept particularly ignorant about it. Im talking about the economically lower class as well as the rural people specifically. So when they meet a guy, fall in love (or at least think they are in love) often times they are pressured into it. And the most common reasoning used is \"anyway we will get married, so what difference does it make if we do it now or then\". This is apart from thebusual \"dont you love me\" and the fear of losing the person she loves. Women are also creatures of desire. But we are also bound by \"being a Virgin for marriage\" and \"family honour \" so this sounds like a good compromise. Then the guy turns out to be false and the woman who still believes that she must be and is expected to be a virgin for her marriage is at a loss because who will marry her now? Its not as simple as saying yes. The people who have casual sex are either of a certain economic class and living in the urban sphere or is seen by the whole community as a bad woman. So you know nothing about the social set up in india and want to comment on it despite not living here or seeing the reality on ground? Dipshit. There are no laws protecting men from rape in this country. We seriously need gender neutral laws They can have casual sex. They should know that their intention is casual sex and not marriage. virginity is still valued a lot in india, and sex before marriage is still considered taboo in majority of the india. in rural areas, women who have had sex before marriage are shamed brutally, socially boycotted and in worst cases, get killed. forget about sex before marriages, even relationships are considered taboo, which is not true in case of men. most the india still is living in the PAST. whatever you have said is only valid for tier 1 cities. Yep happened to my friends brother the women he was dating for 1 year booked a rape case on him when he was trying to break up with her he found out later what an absolute POS that women was he had to plead and beg her to withdraw the case he even was ready to pay the money but she was so insisting on marriage but later he went and talked to that women's father who finally got to know about his cruel daughter and he made her withdraw the case but yeah basically my friends bro lost so much money on the case and police even took money while the case withdrawal so yeah after his case every guy in our colony stopped dating are opting for AM yeah i think average indian guys now starting to realise how fucked up laws are in our country so guys pls stay safe out there India doesn't have gender neutral laws because historically , women were the ones who faced these things. There really should be gender neutral laws Marriage might not happen due to variety of reasons. A girl I know well destroyed a guy's life. I know everything was consensual between them. She used to tell me herself. Relationship went south and the guy didn't see a future together. She went total psycho mode on him (I told her these antics won't win him back). She didn't listen. He got convinced from her psycho acts that this is not sustainable or suitable match. They break up. She continues to pursue and two months later files an FIR. Guy spent 17 days in jail, then got bail. In bail order judge wrote prima facie it seems consensual. Trial on-going. She doesn't want to drag trial as all she wanted was to hurt him. Now, case drags on. They do all the times. To the people supporting this, I have a question. You have a gf and wanna marry her. You had sex. Then she cheats on you, becomes abusive, etc. You leave her. What now? You are a criminal? Same as if you have a gf, she is pushing to have sex before you get to know her properly. You do it under pressure that she doesn't leave. Then you find out she isn't the right one. What now? You can't leave her before marriage and not also after, bcz then she would take half your money? Is this the law you are meant to be supporting? These kinds of rules prove India is still under Islamic influence despite being a Hindu majority country. \"This law considers virginity of a woman to be pure but what about the man then?\" Well this is because of the patriarchal nature of India where rape basically has never applied to men. Misogyny affects men themselves too >Despite the sex being consensual, it is still rape since you didn't consent to having your video taken. It is a crime to take an intimate video and upload it without consent but how the hell it is rape? Am I missing something? Which rural India are u talking about?? Have u ever been to bihar rural area, up rural area and jharkhand rural area?? Well how unaware are you? First, majority of women are not engaging in premarital sex is a gross generalisation. This is just a small percentage of women. And it won’t affect them? You must not be aware of all the coaxing from men, especially because they form the inferior gender in our society. And whatever is consensual? That’s a word that has different meaning for different people, and some of the women are not even aware of it. Especially aware of the choice that they have, that they can in fact say no! On a side note: Do you know even the most literate and educated and whatever middle class valued women who have been married don’t know that they indeed have a choice? And men of such families think that shadi ki hai toh fir hak Banta hai mera. This is the world we live in and women are getting the brunt of it. And yes men also in their own ways have their own struggles. But that’s another thing, here we’re talking about women and yes there’s much more struggle for this sex compared to men. No doubts on that. Stop trying to justify this BS law. Nobody can give any guarantees for Marriage. Just because you have sex doesn't mean the girl feels entitled to marry that person. This stupid law considers consensual sex as rape if the man doesn't marry. How are you even calling it as rape inthe first place Any five year old with working brain cells can tell that law is made to be misused Bro decided to wake up and make a religious claim that literally has no logic to it Yes this law is fkd up and totally illogical >well ur rural wlmen dont engage in premarital sex.. 🤣🤣🤣 These laws are needed because people like you still exist. Who thinks misogyny and talk equality. Resisting is not a perquisite to rape, but neither is lack of information the same as lack of consent. At best, it is fraud and must be treated that way. Not everything related to sex has to be rape or SA. The more you broaden the definition of \"rape\", the more you dilute the severity of the crime. It's weird that there are degrees of murder (let alone battary and assault), but a brutal, violent sexual assault is categorised the same as \"if I marry you will ya sleep with me?\". i dont know which people are op seeing living in \"live in\" but it is obviously true people do engage in premarital sex weather in rural areas as well , the only thing is they never tell about it This law can and will be misused. Imagine a normal relationship between two consenting adults who happen to have sex before marriage. If it doesn't work out for any reason, this law gives the woman the right to falsely blame & frame the man as a culprit who promised marriage. I am not saying premarital sex is right/wrong. There are different people in this world and you should do whatever you feel like. Sex isn't something that a woman gives to a man. It is a bond shared by two people who love each other and an activity performed by them equally. You are an adult, so no one forces you to do anything, including sex, if they do, that's rape. But if you are having consensual sex, that's because you gave your consent, and that's not sex. Just because you were in a fantasy that he owes you a marriage because of an act that you consensually had together, that doesn't mean you can take back your consent months after the act. You can and fully take back your consent during sex, but after you had it, just because you regret it, is not r@pe. You're so concerned about the <1% women that indulge in casual sex in metro cities (of which an even smaller fraction would file fake cases) and leaving out the remaining population of women that can be coerced into sex via manipulation. Of course the law is made to protect the 99% of vulnerable women because unlike you the law makers aren't into black pill ideology. Huh? What religion has to do with this? >so how can they bring up such a law? 'no seal no deal' they wanted it, but they don't want the consequence > Why is a woman's chastity considered more important than a man's chastity ? Because society is terrible and shames women for losing virginity while applauding men for the same. And women have these thoughts internalised which is why many of them consider their virginity precious and to be lost only to their 'true love ' or life partner. > My question is then why is a woman indulging in pre marital sex even if it's based on pretext of marriage ? Could be because she wants to have sex like an average person in a relationship or because she has a boyfriend who manipulated her into engaging in it in the pretext of breaking up etc > But this contradicts the fact that indian society is conservative. No it doesn't because the woman would want to keep it private because she knows the shaming game that'll happen. The conservative society attacks as soon as/only when it gets to know about the sex. > The current law basically takes away any accountability from a woman and assumes that they are gullible enough to fall victim to such scenarios so often that they need a legal recourse. Honestly I don't like that many women agree to sex under the pretext of marriage. I don't like that many of them tie their worth to their virginity. But if that is the reality and if many of them do get affected by such incidents then shouldn't they be protected by laws? Stupid actions don't have to be protected by law. But these girls don't simply have such notions in their mind, they are planted by how the society acts around them so it's not their stupidity. Also, being gullible is not a matter of intelligence imo. It's about exposure. And Indian women generally have less exposure. I'm glad that the proportion of such women is going down and hopefully in the future (idk how we can decide when) we won't need such laws because of the change in mentality of the people and the women. Worst law ever A decade or so ago, the previous government tried to make rape gender neutral, but protest from feminists groups ensured that didn't happened. Thus, in modern India, only men can rape, so obviously the law only applies to men. I mean, yeah, legal prostitution. Yk the problem is you think \"Indian culture\" is great and totally amazing and western culture is bad and totally ridiculous. The bias comes from your distorted thinking of assuming that all of Indian culture is good and all of western culture is bad. However you fail to see that Indian culture has its very shitty parts. Including demonisation of sex and live-in relationships. Which has more ramifications for women if they ever so engage in the aforementioned evil deeds. All because of our society which is based on \"Indian culture\". According to our constitution, only men can rape, so the law only applies to men. First get consensus from feminists. They prevented that from happening, a decade ago. What rural India are we talking about here ? I'm genuinely curious. Well there are both pros and cons of this law. This law is extremely applicable in village settings where men take advantage of women under the pretext of marriage. But let’s also talk about the flipside of it. I’m this day and age where dating is so common in india, a predatory law like this gives cancerous women advantage in the court of law where she can literally ruin someone’s life over fake rape allegations and use this law saying the pretext of marriage. You know what to the woke women defending this law, you know in the bottom of your heart this law is ethically wrong on so many levels, but you know agenda and sense of power will make you defend. Before coming at me as an Indian male, I do not live in india and the place where I live, false rape allegations are a serious thing unlike India. Indian laws are misandrist. Have been so for quite some time now. It's that way to \"protect\" women. Guys remember an NRI defending a predatory law that affects the male of the country she doesn’t even live in. Talk about hypocrisy. Your analogy is deeply flawed. An unconscious woman cannot give an informed consent bcz her brain is not thinking straight. Is this the same as a woman agreeing to sex on the pretext of marriage ? If the woman is so concerned about her chastity, why doesn't she wait till marriage to have sex? That will basically resolve the matter. If a man forces her to have sex that's clearly rape. But if a man lies to have sex and the woman agrees to have sex then she made an adult decision to have sex. If she feels that she can't put her 'chastity' at risk, then it's on her to say no and not succumb to bodily pleasures. The whole law assumes that sex is an act of pleasure for a man but not for a woman. At worse, the law should charge the man with fraud of some kind. \" Sex isn't something that a woman gives to a man. It is a bond shared by two people who love each other and an activity performed by them equally. \" I agree. And that is why it applies to men as well who falsely promise marriage to have it. But that's not how real world works. I won't deny it won't be misused. Some men explicitly promise marriage and then ghost or leave the woman after the deed is done and that's when the consent is null. It's coercion then. There are many men who threaten to break up / leave you if you don't have sex with them because it means you don't love them or are serious about them. And this happens in arrange marriage scene as well. Such an instance is a clear case of coercion when a woman will consent to have sex to save the promised relationship (this happens during engagement period too) and the man will leave after the deed leaving the woman to deal with the aftermath in a conservative society like India. The law is for such men. Obviously. Indian laws are misandrist, and that's somehow made to compensate for the flawed execution by the executive wing of government. Logic? IDK. I agree that this is not a very well thought out concept, but this: >RAPE IS FORCED SEX WHERE THE OTHER RESISTS. ...is not the best definition of rape. A better definition can be, \"when all adult parties involved don't give fully-informed, enthusiastic consent.\" This would include raping someone who is unconscious, sleeping with a minor, rape under coercion, rape under false pretense, etc. Subah ki shuruaat victim blaming ke sath krne ka mza hi kuch aur hai /s How are you supposed to know if he had intent to marry or not? Are police and judges x men? How does one judge intent to marry based on a consensual relationship? Technically all prostitution is legal in india. >If you’ve read about court proceedings, give me one example in which a man was found guilty of rope on false pretext of marriage without adequate proofs/ witness hearings? Let me rephrase something that OP might not have said properly. I know there are genuine cases as well but OP is not talking about them. Let's talk about pure false cases where there is no sex or it was concentual but not under any pretences (this also exists if you don't know, Open tinder to see that hookup exists and women are also a concentual party). Since Indian court system is slow (this is a fact, you can check it) you don't know when your case will end. You get arrested immediatly and society will automatically think you are guilty as this is a serious offence. Your reputation is f\\*cked. Chances are you current job will be terminated. And since a heinous case is lodged against you, your future employment is definetly fucked. And all this because someone thought that I need to cause pain and eventually when the case will be proved false there are no literal consequences. ALL THIS WAS SAID CONSIDERING THE CASE IS FALSE (either there was no sex, or both party consentual sex without any pretences which exists which you might not have seen till date so try to find this and you will get the shock of your life) Process is the punishment in India. The arresting police officer told him. Sir aap galat fans gaye, we know you are not like that but aapki bail 15 din baad hogi. Aur total aapka 5-7 lakh ka kharcha aayega. Case ka kharcha alag se. Is the girl retarded? If she doesn't want to have sex she should say no, if women are as stupid as you make them out to be, they shouldn't have any rights to sign contracts or do anything without male assistance because using your logoc poor naive girl might get conned into anything. Do you support a complete patriarchy with no rights for women? Because that's the only way your logic works. rape, unlawful sexual activity, most often involving sexual intercourse, against the will of the victim through force or the threat of force or with an individual who is incapable of giving legal consent because of minor status, mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness, or deception. The issue today are two fold. 1) Flawed and corrupted executive means many women face severe issues when filing complaints, and many a times certain men can get away with assault and rape, because the have the police in their pocket. 2) Misandrist laws ensured that rich and educated women can take advantage of men whenever, as long as they know the law and can force to executive to action through proper channels. Thus you get situations of honest men being exploited, just because. In conclusion, the obvious solution should be to fix the executive wing, and make the laws gender neutral to prevent exploitation, but that's obviously NOT what the government did. If the situation continues on the same path(which it's, unfortunately), it would simply tear the country into two, this time based on sex. Im pretty sure OP here has not had sex, let alone even made out actually with a girl. Such is the life of the young Indian man, pondering about potential rape allegations that may arise, if they were ever to have sex, while getting no hoes. The same social setup that modern society reject? Equal rights for all, doesn't means freely taking away rights of the opposite sex. Two wrongs don't make a right, but who's gonna tell our legislative that? Bengalis can justify everything with a stupid word salad I guess. There is absolutely no need to make sense. They were probably ChatGPT before ChatGPT in terms of sputtering out useless trash. Sir, the fact remains that she’s not even aware of it that she can in fact say no. Ever battered woman who’s not independent in her thought or action, forever conditioned in the society, even as a child she knows that, forms trauma bonds, give in to coaxing. Hence, the word rape. What you’re saying is true, that she should say no. But around her she’s never seen an example of saying no. It doesn’t even occur to her that she can say no. That’s the whole point. And I’m not talking about the minority of women who are aware of her rights but the other majority who do not have this! whats wrong in having gender neutral laws if this generational thrive for gender equality? Please elaborate kind sir. How is what OP said misogynist? how aksing for gender neutral laws is misogynist? Feminist organisations prevented rape from becoming gender neutral, when the previous government tried to do so, a decade ago. You should just STFU if you don't know anything. When the transgender issue gains prominence, a few years to a decade or two from now, the government would be forced to either make the laws gender neural, or even more convoluted that it's today. Here's to hoping. Like I said that if society is terrible and shames them for losing virginity -> Option 1. They believe in this mindset and have sex after marriage. This whole issue of sex on the pretext of marriage does not happen as she got married. Marital rape is another issue but it's not related to our topic of discussion. Option 2. They know that the society will shame them for having sex. But they still decide to have sex bcz they can't resist the temptation of normal healthy bodily pleasures. In that case, they took a calculated risk. It was their decision to have sex very well knowing that the society will look down upon them if they know she lost her virginity. You cannot equate the temptation to indulge in sex by a woman as manipulation by a man. That is basically saying that women don't enjoy sex. They just do it to get married. And only men derive pleasure out of sex. And the concept of exposure doesn't come into play in this situation. Even if a woman is from a backward area, she is going to have the above two options. If she truly is in an extremely conservative community/surroundings and despite that she succumbs to bodily pleasures, she made her decision. You cannot blame anyone for that. Dude I'm assuming ur pain is the women who really deserve the law support aren't getting and the one who misuse it are having thier way? If that's your intention,that's how world works ,people who want loan won't get a penny really,but there are people who are skipping state budgets sized loans Humans are humans, focus on addressing ur points well If that's not what u mean,I would say just grown up hiw is asking for gender neutral laws victim blaming? As a Bengali i would like to defend my race. Unfortunately we have some degenerates like this NRI commentor who have not touch to reality for gods sakes they r \"ADULT\" IF THEY SLEEP WITH CONSENT....ITS THEUR CHOICE...THEY R NOT SOME CHILD TO BE MANIPULATED.... WHY CANT MEN FILE THISE CASES THEN? CANT THEY BE MANIPULATED? I wish I could give this answer an award then it's a case of cheating and lying, not rape. Do you not see the difference? 'it doesn't even occur to her to say no' -> if a woman is truly brought up in a super conservative surrounding then she would believe that relationships, especially that have pre marital sex are 'bad' and frowned upon by society. In fact that's what the whole society tells them to do. Essentially say no to relationships. If she goes against that belief that is wrongfully instilled in her from childhood then it is her calculated decision. You cannot then say that she is unaware of what she is doing. It's not a crime if both of them consent to it. You wouldn't have consented knowing that they were recording it so it was rape. Manipulation isn't r@pe! Then she was the one who didn't want to marry you. There should be clauses excluding cheating or abuse but they should know the circumstances under which they consent to sex. >A law is always made after seeing the situations. A country like India which keeps the honor on women's vagina needs such law. Honor killing happens because of this. Absolutly true. But (there is a 'but' as always). Can we talk about false cases (which need not to be proved just the complain is enough to destroy someone's life, I hope you know how). By false case I mean 1. There is no Sex, just a pure false case. And this type of false cases are popular because you don't have to proof that you were r\\*ped by using 'Rape Kit'. And there is no limitaion on time frame as it might have happened years ago as well. 2. There was sex but it was concentual and not under any false pretences. When the law was made it was really useful as it was based on the society of that time, it is useful in today's time as well since there are genuine cases as well and scary part you can find some culprit in matrimonial apps as well. But the issue is that there is safe guard against the misuse of this law. Some safe guard which can be placed (IMO) : 1. Immediate Bail as this was a concentual sex and not foced. But issue a type of restraining order to protect the victim. OR no arrest until there is any small amount of proof that the case might be legit. 2. Complete annonimity of the parties involved not only the victim since we don't konw if the caase is real or not and so that society does not frame accused as guilty. 3. Quick judgement (this is a difficult one as our justice system is slow). We can discuss more on the safe guards. Note: Please read and understand the whole comment before replying. 1. Typing in all caps makes you look like an absolute child 2. Contrary to the black pill ideology you have consumed, men and women are far from being equals in this country. Men will always be on the disadvantaged side when it comes to the law because that's a very valid way of protecting half of the population that have been oppressed for centuries at this point. 3. Sure there will be fake cases filed against men by few women in metro cities but for every fake case, thousands or even tens of thousands of vulnerable women will have some level of protection from getting taken advantage of in less developed parts of the country. Is it unfair? Obviously. But how women were treated by men and society in general for centuries or even millennia was even more unfair. Laws are fair only in fairy tale land. Irl several laws are meant to protect different sections of the population and this specific one is made to protect the largest chunk of the population. Why are you so occupied with this one unfair law when there are many more sophisticated unfair laws? Let me guess, they don't get you tilted as much since one would pretty much need a law degree to understand several of the laws and precedents set by the courts while this one law could be cherrypicked by watching a single YouTube video and getting angry. You'd be wrong lol. They do.. 💀 This law by default assumes only women get betrayed/cheated. Do you have a law In place when a women leaves a man for better options? Sounds stupid right because ppl evolve and this things happen this isn't r@pe but guess what this law will add another weapon which will be misused in future, how are you even gonna prove this bs. The man loses his dignity, peace of mind and number of years in these cases. Any law can be misused, that is not reason to not have laws. Even laws about accidents do get misused, that is no reason to not implement laws. A person should still know the circumstances under which they consent to sex if its consensual its not rape.... an adult woman is not child to be manipulated... if it really was that important many countries which are more forward about gender equality would have had this law. i know this country is way behind gender equality..but that doesnt mean we start propagating something wrong.aim for equality from both sides.criticise anything that is discriminatory against any gender. You're not asking for gender neutral laws, you're asking for laws protecting women to be removed. I would support a gender neutral laws like this, if a woman promises marriage and has sex, she should still be charged >There should be clauses excluding cheating or abuse In a country where women get alimony even after cheating and domestic violence against men is still not accepted, really? Also, now reverse the genders and read your statement again. You would be called a misogynist for saying women should find someone willing to have sex without marriage and don't promise to marry them. Also, what I think is to have sex only after marriage, if one pushes you to do it, they aren't the one. It goes for both. A rape law can also be misused, is that a reason for a genuine victim of rape to not get justice because it's misused? Op talking about South delhi South bombat >“resisting” was a prerequisite, then raping an unconscious person wouldn’t be rape. *Consensual* was the word he used 🙌🙌 I'm against giving women alimony if they cheat, I don't support that. If the woman doesn't want to marry, then she should find someone who will have sex without marrying. I do agree with that. Even if you personally think sex should be done after marriage, there should still be laws about this. A person should know the circumstances under which they consent to sex. You didn't even get the point of my comment. Sleeping with a woman or having sex and then deciding not not marry her doesn't make any man a rapist. The law is inherently wrong which means most of the times it will be misused Congress has promised in their manifesto to review all laws to ensure that they are gender neutral.. Atleast they acknowledge that there is a problem. >Also, a serious committed relationship usually means a promise of marriage. Now, if you(guys) broke up for whatever reason, it's over, obviously. This is the problem with the Law. Breakups can happen due to a multitude of reasons. Doesnt mean a woman can just file rape cases because the relationship didn't work out. If he promises marriage and then decides not to(under normal circumstances) then he is wrong. If he never promised to marry her then the problem doesn't come up, he can't charge him with rape in that case. It wasn't actually feminists who opposed that For the vast majority of women losing their virginity to someone they're not getting married to or the news of the relationship/failure of the relationship/premarital sex getting out pretty much destroys their entire life. They'll be ostracised by society, their own family, friends, relatives and work colleagues. Then possibly lose out on marriage options/career options and financial leeway. Who do you think was responsible for shaping up the society into such a patriarchal hell hole where an adult woman living her life (even worse, the victim in most cases) has to live in such fear and oppression? The men. Of course the men of today bear some level of burden for the mistakes of their ancestors so that similar mistakes won't be repeated by the ones living now. Lawmakers are hell bent to make our lives worse in every way possible. When logic goes out of window terms like incel, insecure, misogynist, toxic, controlling come into picture Good point, Its not about being gender neutral but rather why this dumbass law exists in the first place Then who? That's what the records say. Already addressed this in my previous comment All those countries didn't completely screw over women as much so they have way more exposure to relationships and interpersonal dynamics to not get taken advantage of. You're hellbent on thinking law is meant to be fair n shit but in reality it's actually not. There are way more harmful wrong laws that you won't be able to grasp the extent of wrongness and equally more precedent cases that streamline judgments given to current cases that are totally based on the prior cases. By this same logic reservation also shouldn't exist but in reality targeted and systematic oppression against weaker sections of the society will always have a factor of the past scenario in it to level the playing field. It's not about your king hitting mine. Imagine if he starved my entire kingdom (as a result I lost my life, my family, friends, probably even children), put it through a famine, didn't let it economically prosper by controlling the trade routes, let it rot for decades and then taught his prince to do the same and so on for thousands of years? At that point these stack up in ways that can't give the oppressed population any way out even if the oppression is magically removed. Don't use false equivalences to validate your limited pov. I am not defending the law as it stands. I am, however, supporting the hypothetical gender-neutral version of this law, properly scaffolded by other laws that criminalize rape and other sexual misconduct in a compatibly gender-neutral manner. Put differently, I maintain that true consent must be informed, irrespective of the genders of those involved. And my views on this matter haven’t changed since I left India, which wasn’t all that long ago and isn’t necessarily permanent. I also have family of all genders living there, and am an Indian citizen, so I have stake in the laws there. [Every relationship that doesn’t lead to marriage isn’t rape: Supreme Court](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-warns-against-misusing-rape-laws-in-failed-relationship-cases-emphasizes-consent-and-consequences-101692641360835-amp.html) Which part of my comment did you find incoherent? I spent quite some time drafting it, so I would appreciate the feedback. Which part of my comment did you find unrealistic, and which of the implied moral standings did you find degenerate? Don't promise to marry then, if they're unsure or know they can't then they shouldn't promise to marry. If things don't work out, they don't work out like if she cheats or becomes abusive. Men often promise marriage even though they didn't intend to so that they can have sex with a woman and then leave. Don't promise marriage and have sex with someone who doesn't want a promise of marriage. I have no idea why u think someone who has not had sex/made out as some kind of inssult because it doesn't come across as insulting, Infact you are shaming the years of feminism women have worked for so that they don't get objectified and not looked as some sex object, u insulting him just proves that his worth or opinions are valuable if he has had sex/made out with some women. Do better. Also counter logically to the post, insulting on personal level doesn't get discussion anywhere >Process is the punishment in India This fucking thing . It's the process. “Not thinking straight” is not the only way someone can be uninformed. Wilful deception counts. Also, you have entirely ignored my example of how a man could be a victim of a similar deception, i.e. of a false pretext that leads him to consent. Nowhere have I defended the law as it stands, and indeed the gendered nature of it is based on flawed assumptions of how women perceive sex. OP posits that the act criminalized by the law shouldn’t be criminal at all, whereas I take the position that it should be criminal irrespective of gender. Independent of that, I have also corrected OP’s misconception that most Indian women have casual sex. I have a theory on women empowerment....Its like reservation. First some politician did little bit of good for women and called it women empowerment... Then the next politician wanted to out do the first politician in women empowerment...so he did some more of it...3rd politician wanted to outdo 2nd one... And 10 gazzilion politicians later...we have so much women empowerment being done that there is no empowerment left to be done, so now they are doing oppression of men. So going forward every time a girl says \"papa nahi maan rahe\" and refuses to marry her bf, the bf should have right to file \"rape on promise of marriage\" against the women. If yes, I fully support this in gender neutral form. Because I would like to file 5 rape cases against 5 of my ex gfs who all dumped my ass to marry Rich NRIs... Poonam, Simran, Diksha, Sneha, Garima..I am coming for you. Read my comment again...I didn't say video recording without consent is not a crime. It is a crime. But it's no way rape lmao. Rape is intercourse against the will/ by coercion/without consent. Uploading a video without the other one knowing after CONSENSUAL SEX is not rape, it is just a crime. It's a loophole. But, I think there are amendments to that. Do check that. >Even if you personally think sex should be done after marriage, there should still be laws about this. Not everything should be a law. If you are having sex bcz you will marry, wait until then. People misuse these laws and how will you stop that Just look at the number of gross \"no seal no deal\" comments from men below girls'photos. Look at matrimonial subs where men keep asking if they should marry a woman with a past. You will realize how much MEN, if not the women themselves, value virginity even in modern times. Even if we assume that all women are now modern (which isn't true btw), all men are not modern and it is because of their patriarchal mindset that virginity still matters. . Look at the number of guys in relationships who say \"tumhara pyaar sacha hota to tumhe ye sab krne me dikkat nhi hoti. I love you na baby, tum nhi krti kya\" etc etc. Your unreasonable solution is that the girl should just get up, walk away from her boyfriend of one year, and walk down to the police station. It doesn't take into account the basics of any relationship - emotions. Its not so easy to walk away from your partner. If you threaten to, they will apologize and say \"arre sorry na baba, tum itni sundar ho mujhse control hi nhi hota. Abse nhi force krunga pakka\" and then he'll do it again a week later. . Again & again & again while getting you attached to him, making the relationship more & more serious, making false promises of marriage and IF and WHEN the girl finally agrees to have sex, in order to \"prove her love\" for him - he dumps her & goes off to his friends to talk about his latest \"achievement.\" . Now you'll say that this is all man-ghadan kahani. That's because you've spent your life as a man & will never know what it feels like to be a girl. Manority of girls dream of their wedding from childhood. The feeling of finally finding a man that loves you...and finding out that he only wanted you for your body - is a pain you'll never experience. . . You asked why isn't this law gender neutral then? Bcuz in your mind, it is simply about saying no to marriage after sex, which women also do. But that's not what the law actually is. It punishes FALSE promise of marriage in order to get sex. Do you think a woman needs to lie that \"arre hum shadi kr to lenge. Abhi sex dedo na please, I promise I'll marry you.\" Sounds weird? That's bcuz it doesn't happen. . No one asks if the guy us a virgin. The world isn't obsessed with the \"past\" of men. Women may lie or cheat on their partners, but they don't lie to GET sexual benefits. Hence, this particular provision of rape (which inherently relates to sexual activities) is not applicable the other way around. Hope you understand a bit better now. Sincerely, A lawyer. That is a good thing. But nevertheless this law shouldn't exist. Not everyone is that lucky. Plus, courts and such waste a lot of time and money. I doubt the guy was compensated for this. Holy fuck. I never in my life thought people in this sub would support such a degenerative fucking law. I guess liberals across the globe have this problem of seeing everything through an idealistic lens (seeing what something could/should be instead of what it is/will be. Its a grave problem according to me). But I beg of everyone who’s defending laws like this…do you trust this government and society to impartially judge people who are tried under this law? I don’t. I usually avoid shaming anyone for their opinions but anyone who is comfortable with the law should not call himself/herself liberal or progressive. The state is no one to interfere in the matters of bedroom (of course, unless rape is concerned). Even if a guy deceives a girl into losing her virginity, this is strictly a matter between the two of them. Now, is it possible that the \"conservative society\" might shame the girl for losing her virginity pre marriage? Yes, that is a possibility but there is also a possibility that they just don't care enough. If your core problem is only with the shame the girl has to face, then you have to realize there is a spectrum - from \"sl*t\" to \"broken family honour\". At what point do you draw the line? Is the girl's friend saying she is a 'sl*t' for having sex before marriage enough to file a case against the guy? It's beyond ridiculous. Obviously, I don't deny that there might be cases where girls might even get killed for 'shaming the family' but in such extreme cases, the person(people) in the family involved is to be blamed. Hello, im fairly ignorant when i comes to Law. Could you please educate me with the amendments? Thank you If you asked your exes about marriage, and you would not have had sex with them without the promise of marriage, then you were indeed raped and should have access to justice. I know it is an unfamiliar sensation for a man to consider himself a rape victim, but it does indeed happen and I encourage you to seek help. I have checked these for a friend of mine. I am not familiar with law either. You can Google search and find a reliable source. Some document from a good source rather than an article. Holy fuck braindead take. Half the country is buring, quick we need a tsunami to cool it off (drown the other half) Sab mar jao At this point in time, government should start breeding/intercourse centers where both parties have to fill a notarized consent form before engaging in intercourse. And you have to get a new form notarized everytime you wanna have sex. Orwell would be proud. /s There is no relation between sex and marriage. That's the logic.. but people think sex and marriage are related.. Only married people or people they are gonna get married can have sex Can men file this? yaar idk who is right i just know im not dating anyone i dont know personally . my uncle is in court for false dowry case. 1 friend recently had a false rape case against him just before he was supposed to go to germany. its a hot mess The premise of the entire act was marriage. That changed. Without a deterrent for that, men will and have taken advantage of this tactic for years. They even pose as serious for marriage in matrimonial portals only to have fun. I get that there are real couples who amicably break up or one of them does due to real reasons and the court has said that they will deal with those not considering them as rape, but to say that just because some outliers exist, you should not have this law at all for the people who are actually suffering. That’s a mighty privileged take. This is a classic case of fraud. If you bought something thinking it is one thing but found out it doesn’t work, wouldn’t you file a case against the seller? This is sexual fraud, hence rape. OP are you essentially saying we shouldn’t have laws for sexual fraud or that it doesn’t happen? Just wait until women get 50% reservation in parliament, this is just the beginning. It really is a stupid concept. Like one cant change their mind about marrying someone if they have had intercourse? All instances become rape? And above all, how can one always prove that they had intercourse because she was promised marriage? ig the only way for this is that the woman should get a signed document that her lover agrees to marry her prior to act so there are no false cases Facts, op's entire page is filled with questions on women. His one post says, \"A guy should never marry his gf, because this indicates that she's broken the norms of society to do something she likes and can therefore leave you in the future for someone better\" and another post says \"Women complain about periods but I've seen so many women do sports while on their period. So are women lying about this and they shouldn't get paid leave for it\" I cant understand how intentipk of gwtting married to that person can be grounds for having sex works. How about not having sex before marriage then? You like someone feel attracted are compatible and have sex. How does not gonna marry that person changes chemistry? And if it does, save yourself the trouble and dont engage in sex This is at least a Padma Vibhushan worthy comment. Lol just stop it. Please educate yourself about rape first then talk about laws. Even if judiciary wants to stop fake promises, the law should have been about deceit and cheating. Having sex with someone and not marrying that person doesn't make you rapist ffs Imo in some cases bf promises gf that he will marry her , so they will engage in physical relationship before marriage. But later bf refuses to marry her (let say he lied just to get laid with her). In this kind of scenarios this law is applicable. Ofcourse i agree that this is not rape, it can be considered as lying and cheating as you said. But the problem comes, when women misuse these laws. In cases like bf-gf only wanted to date and there was no promise of marriage but she wanted to marry him one-sidedly then she can put this case on bf on ruin his life. And also in cases like bf-gf agreed to marry, but later gf cheated on him(cases like this are increasing in modern india), then bf has every right to not marry such kind of person. But gf can put this \"rape on false pretext of marriage\" case on him and ruin his life. Good and bad people exist in both genders. But yeah these kind of laws should be modified. Advocating for \"gender neutral laws\" but all you want is power over women. If you knew the ground reality of such cases happening to women, your ego still wouldn't be able to accept that even today in India women need laws like this to accept themselves, and every law can me misused, which doesn't mean that the law itself needs to be scraped away completely Seriously? If that's true then I'll vote for Congress, but I didny see this particular point Not everything should be but this should Yes they were. Look up what happened the last time when we were close to making it gender neutral *Just in case you haven’t or if you want to read,* *I created a whole PDF document comparing both the manifestos topic wise in a side by side tabular manner so that it makes it easier and faster to make informed decisions for the benefit of all and it has the exact same words and lines from each manifestos and nothing is changed or deleted/missed.* **Here is the Google Docs document :** [**Manifesto Proposals - A Side-by-Side Comparison**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzUa5PXtgJg_mXJxsLH4zFIcA6Ohy5ho/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112103166487411801226&rtpof=true&sd=true) *And here is the* [**PDF Version of the document**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bdz8Ee7B96aO36pP5_cZpe47PBkCDDc/view?usp=drivesdk) *Read Time of the entire document : 30 Minutes* Might as well give them a chance and see what’s in the store. She can also cheat after marriage and husband cant do anything. It was without consent tho. A person needs to know the circumstances Freely taking away what rights? Any fool will agree that the law should be expanded to include men. What rights are taken away exactly???? Oh nah, the very first point I see while scrolling is to increase women's reservation and grant them income. That's not Equality The problem is , man cant prove that he didn't promise >Multiple women were used (in men's vocab) and were shamed by the society How does this regressive law fix that problem? The law just makes pre-marital sex even more stigmatized. >Call it karma or whatever. Cry about it. Aww you feel too strongly about this. Sorry you were fucked and chucked. Then make it gender neutral misandrist. Yupp i also saw those posts and comments thats why i made that comment. These are just newly generated troll kids who cry inequality online but do all sorts of vile stuff in real life. Here the consent was given by the girl because she was promised/made to believe that there would be marriage eventually. If this promise or understanding was not reached then the girl would not have consented to the sexual relationship. So therefore it's rape. It's very simple. Guys if you want to fuck around make it very clear at the beginning that you looking to have sex and not looking to marry. The 56\" chest comes in handy here. Be upright and forthcoming, instead of being a loser and lying. As said by the OP these girls are there, some idiot will spread for you! Even I know a lot of girls who were abused and cheated. What are you tryin to say? Sex without consent is rape. If consent was manufactured through manipulation then is it true consent? *”All laws will be scrutinised for gender discrimination and gender bias. The offending provisions will be removed or amended in the first year of the Congress government”* Pretty sure it was the women of the feminist movement who sat in front of lotus temple to not ket gender neutral rape laws pass. Consent not resistance is pre requisite. You completely misinterpreted it. An unconscious person cannot consent that's why it's rape. maybe we could have like a written agreement before relationship to avoid hassles? idk The law gives a fear in the minds of these chaters and the numbers would go wrong. For example, you would think twice before entering any premature relationship, than that of your father and grandfather. Your forefathers exploited, the grandsons are facing the karma. P.s- Personal attacking you and your family, because you attacked me in your last line. You deserve this. People should choose better instead of relying on the laws everytime to get them out of trouble. Unlike being conned of money, there are a lot of steps involved into a woman having sex. It's not like slipped on a banana peel and had sex. People lie all the time, then we should make a law about lying. Thats still not rape read on informed consent and sadly from this comment section it looks like women will keep misusing this law and other women will always support them and their wrongs. It still supports reservation and granting only them income. It's self contradictory It's the stupidest legal concept. Foreign jurisdictions laugh at this concept. To know more Watch VAASHI Movie in Netflix. Tovino Thomas movie. It's Malayalam, but English and Hindi subtitles are available. The movie points out the stupity of the artificially made provision. You can give it the i love falsely accusing men and ruining their life award the twox sub can give her their highest honour too , let your misandristic tendencies be shown to the world. with how much wase u use the term \"Men\" does ur father and brother do the same? i am assjmjng they r men too Consent not resistance is pre -requisite . An unconscious woman cannot consent which is why it's a rape. If it was about mere resistance then Vishakha Guidelines or sexual abuse by person in position of power would not exist. Because we don't see much resistance there but it happens. Also what you consider as majority online and offline is a skewed statistics. Most of the women even in rural and semi urban area have access to SM and in my native village, Rural women are more promiscuous, so many cases of them running away with their bf after marriage, In that case men must have the remedy to file rape case. However the question here is not about gender equality for application of Rape but \"Rape\" being used as tool to deter consensual pre marital sexual activity only to the extent of one gender is a dangerous precedent. Because then you come under a single category of rapist and you are in the same pool of a rapist who grabs and rapes a girl without consent. The tag is a stigma. Layman would see the philosophy in your statement but me as a lawyer call this the biggest BS There will be cases, where the man really didn't promise. But when the woman put this case on him, how will he prove that he didn't promise. He cant prove it. And he will get jailed. Man is guilty until he is proven innocent. That is how it is in this country. They should choose better regardless of laws. That's no reason to not have laws. If the lie is big enough, then people are charged with civil or criminal cases. We all agree with them If he didn't promise then there won't be evidence and without evidence , they can't be convicted. Most real cases are dropped in this country He can prove that he didn't promise, the burden of proof lies on the person who made the accusation. If there is no evidence then he can't be convicted. Both your options implies succumbing to societal pressures irrespective of what the woman wants. That's your solution?? > You cannot equate the temptation to indulge in sex by a woman as manipulation by a man. When did I equate that? I mentioned that the reasons for a woman to have sex could be her own desires OR could be something like manipulation by her partner. I didn't equate them. > Even if a woman is from a backward area, she is going to have the above two options. What? Just not have sex? That's seriously your solution to the problem of someone becoming a victim because her partner broke her trust or manipulated her? In that case we wouldn't have divorces in this country considering the stigma around it, women wouldn't have financial independence or anything if women just stopped doing things fearing the stigma. > she made her decision I won't say that people shouldn't be wary of others in any situation but choosing to trust one's partner is not a crime worth the punishment society awards her with. Blame the society if you can't blame the partner who broke her trust and made false promises. > You deserve this Lol. Really thought you did something with the \"attacks\". Move on dumbo. In city, it is still there but more subtle, becausee unlike rural areas, the people know how to keep a filter on. Why should the law take responsibility for women who make such bad decisions even after careful thought? Women are cherished for their virginity in India right? Men are cherished for what they earn, so when men spend years and don't get a job despite promises from institutes, does the law take responsibility for that? When a woman makes a guy pay for dates and ghosts, does the law take responsibility for that? When the guy gets his career ruined due to a false allegation, does the law take responsibility for that? Why bail women out of their bad decisions but not men? What if she said, he promised verbally. YOU=“resisting” was a prerequisite, then raping an unconscious person\"... Unconscious person can't give consent and r...e was committed during unconscious state to thwart resistance hence it is r...e Because you are so western, read about stealth rape. Consent is based on some pre conditions. Consent is null and void if those conditions are not met. This is not hard to grasp unless you are mysognist. In Indian context, sex out of wedlock is taboo. People gets killed becoz of this. A women having child within marriage and out of marriage is a matter of praise vs shame; life vs death. And this law is not used a systematic tool against Indian men as incels claim. No one presents data of how many men are being charged or in jail bcoz of this. However majority of men are having sex out of wedlock. Oh my fucking god! Consensual Sex is not R@pe! The decision to have sex before or after marriage is irrelevant. It's a personal choice. Someone who has had consensual sex before marriage is not a \"genuine victim of r@pe\". By having this BS laws, the people (men and women) who has had been r@ped brut@lly (sex without consent) would have a harder time being believed and wouldn't be taken seriously. \"Having told without the right circumstances\" is another bunch of BS, as a relationship can end due to a plethora of reasons. And it isn't always the man who initiates sex. If you don't wanna have sex without marriage, hold youself to that standard, if anyone isn't with you on the same page and doesn't have empathy for you, kick them out of your life because how tf can they be your life partner if they are selfish and don't give an f about you. I didn't wanna make this a relationship advice kind of thing but you certainly forced me to. The men who force women to have sex with them (for love) are manipulators and are the worst kind of animals. But this law is so BS that a normal person (male) will find himself behind bars literally for having consensual sex just because his relationship didn't work out. Let's say you are a male and have a relationship with a girl. You didn't force her to have sex. You both decided to have it together or maybe it's the girl that initiated that. After a while, let's say she cheats on you or is abusive to you and you break up with her. This sht law gives the girl an unfair power to drag you through the mud because of something consensual that happened in the past. Like WTF! And if you wanna wait till marriage, are your standards that sh!t that you can't control yourself till marriage, even if it's something that YOU DECIDED! This is another BS Indian law that invades an individual's personal life without any reason. cant u see the difference between stealth rape and what we have in india \"rape on pretext of marriage\" whatever u said...does it have any context to what are we talking about I think this is a matter of the OP (and most people) seeing things differently. I will try to provide my two cents. If somebody doesn't wish to engage in sexual activities unless they are getting married to the other person, the other person shouldn't even try coerce the person in question by hook or crook. If they do coerce the person in question, it should be labelled as rape, because you are engaging in that activity without complete consent of the person in question. Please note that I mentioned complete consent, since the consent is given only when there is promise of marriage. You can point out that it could be a case of deceiving rather than rape. To that I would say, in my opinion, if somebody invades somebody else's personal space by any means, gets intimate with them in a false pretext, it should amount to a harsher crime than simply deceiving. If we were to compare the two offenses, I believe rape holds more weight than simply deceiving them. Hence, if somebody's intimacy is taken advantage of, or their personal space is invaded without their complete consent, it should be judged as rape rather than deceiving, since the crime is just that egregious. If you were to say that, \"people are becoming more modern, more western, they engage in sex with anybody at all,\" I would mention that, yes, people are more open towards sex, but WITH THE PERSON THEY COMPLETELY CONSENT TO. This consent must be mutual and open. People do have sex with others without the prospect of marriage and it is absolutely fine if all the people involved are okay with it. Some people consent to having sex without the promise of marriage, others consent to having sex only with the promise of marriage. It is their right. Finally coming to the point of false cases, yes they do exist. It would be ignorant of me not to acknowledge that. But that is why courts exist. So that they can fight it out legally and the truth of the matter is brought forward. I am not going into the skewdness or the biasness of the law in question, since I believe that shouldn't be a metric to judge whether a law is implemented. But that is a separate discussion altogether, I simply wanted to talk about what people do and do not consider rape. Thank you for reading through this, and I would love to read through some of your opinions, as long its respectful and not simply childish name-calling. Constitution doesn't define rape, o reddit philosopher. This was the stupidest possible answer to a detailed analysis. What word do you want me to use when we are talking about a law that favors women and can be used against men? Obviously I'll say men only right? 🙄 The fact that you were unable to understand anything despite several commentators trying to explain the law to you, and chose to resort to personal attacks on my family, tells a lot about your character. To answer your disgusting question, I don't have any brothers and our parents belonged to a different generation where people would get married early without having time for dating & relationships (at least in case of my family). So no, I wasn't talking about mine or anyone's parents or people of the previous generations. Men here refers to the current generation of men just like when YOU criticized modern day women in your original post for sleeping around, you were talking about the women of your generation and weren't shaming your mom or Aunt. Kuch smjh aya ab or are you really just daft? Any more personal attacks left?? You are precisely the kind of \"men\" I was talking about, who cannot see the point and resort to personal attacks about family members of those who have a different opinion than you. Shame on you OP. Dekho Bhai yeh urban areas may yeh logic apply karoge toh chalega but rural area may ekdum opposite hai , so in short majority ko protect karne Kay lia Aisa law hai but some people get effected but it's for the greater good in short. So I always suggest people to verify your chats , recording from independent places not by the police and then submit it to court. I think u are confusing two topics. Rape on false pretext of marriage being first. And the 2nd being Wrongful Cases of Rape based on false charges about Pretext of marriage. If u are having Sex with a girl, with a promise of marriage, u can't back down mate. Our society is not built as such. Premarital sex is not a 'western concept'. It happens everywhere. Maybe in Western countries, people are not fixated on virginity and stuff, but here, in our country, the story is very different. U can't 'change ur mind', after bashing someone. This is not how these things work. I am sorry to say this, but come out of ur bubble. Tier 1,2,3 doesn't matter. If u find a girl, who is into casual hookups, good for you. Do whatever you want. But if you are promising something to get something, gotta keep the promise mate. Either don't make promises, or keep them. And finally, about the wrongful cases, there are many judgments of courts. U can look it up on the internet. If u did no promises, u got to have some strong proof to give to the court. And these laws need to be women-centric. They are there to protect women. Not men. Men don't need no protection from our society. Men are not 'slut-shamed'. In fact, the slang is designed for women. Men are called Studs and Players. Women are called Whores and Sluts. Even in the west. Grow up Boy. Read my above comment you dumb fk! \"Some men explicitly promise marriage and then ghost or leave the woman after the deed is done and that's when the consent is null. It's coercion then.\" For the love of God, do you have common sense? You aren't having sex after he left you, so what consent now? Don you even know what consent is? Consent is like an agreement, you can change your mind before sex or during sex. NOT AFTER SEX! If you want to have sex after marriage, FUCKIN HOLD YOUSELF TO THAT STANDARD! DON'T FUCK WITH SOMEONE WHO HASN'T MARRIED YOU! END OF THIS MOTHERFUCKING CONVERSATION! Nobody can force you to have sex! If they do, THAT'S ACTUAL R@PE! Mutually deciding isn't R@pe. \"There are many men who threaten to break up / leave you if you don't have sex with them because it means you don't love them or are serious about them. And this happens in arrange marriage scene as well. Such an instance is a clear case of coercion when a woman will consent to have sex to save the promised relationship (this happens during engagement period too) and the man will leave after the deed leaving the woman to deal with the aftermath in a conservative society like India.\" Sweety, you shouldn't be with someone who threatens to break up for any reason in the first place. Secondly, If someone wants you just for your body, leave them! And secondly, even if a guy is super respectful and is a normal guy who didn't even force/threaten or anything, who decided along with his gf together to have sex, is also at risk. The actual GOOD PERSON is also at risk. Even if the girl initiated, the Guy is still at risk. If you think you'd be judged in a country like India, which you will, and I have empathy for that, still, if you know the consequences, don't have sex in the first place, break up with them, leave them, and find someone who actually understands you and waits with you. Enjoying sex mutually and then putting the entire blame on the other person is HIGHLY SEXIST! Bhikari saale, agar 5-5 ladkian tumko chhod kar ja chuki hain because you are too gareeb, toh apne aukaat ki ladkia pataya karo bhai. Bro har gaon mein premarital sex common hai at least in Bengal Bihar Orissa and whole of North East, please check your delusion first. >rape under false pretense Yo what is this \"rape under false pretense\"? I am pretty sure OP is objecting to that exact thing and especially that \"false pretense\" concept being lob sided to being applicable to one gender. \"Consent under coercion\" makes total sense but dafuq is \"false pretense\". I don't think a producer who promised a role in his/her movie to a new wannabe actor/actress and then didn't give it should be charged with rape, he can be charged with cheating though. I mean is the producer a pervy clown?-yes but the person accepting that is pretty much equivalent to engaging in prostitution, and prostitution is legal in India. Yes, it is. No matter what the context is, if you said yes and willfully participated, that means you consented. It isn't illegal in any country other than the great INDIA. Don't wanna have sex before marriage, how about closing your legs? >help you see it in a less gendered way: if a woman said she is infertile to a man who didn’t want kids, and he agrees to sex only because of that, then he was raped. Please, this is such a silly argument. In an ideal world where men have the right to opt out of pregnancies i.e not pay for a child born without their consent because both men and women should have that right and no one should be able to force another person into becoming a parent against their will (not the case currently). Then your example becomes pointless because the person clearly consented to the sex and just not to being a parent. Come up with better examples to defend your mental gymnastics and not use another unfair gendered law to defend one you're arguing against, this is an easy to spot logical fallacy. Consent was based on some pre conditions in both cases. And then I wrote multiple paras to give context why they created this law in India. And then I added that you are not going to provide any data how many men are in jail bcoz of it. And you will whine again in some other forum after reading all the replies. And you will never write anything for equality which is going to help women. You only cry equality when you think there is something against men. If consent changes when that information is provided and that information is with-held on purpose, it becomes fraud in every scenario and fraud leading to sex is rape. Deriving consent by withholding information IS rape. For example - if person has sexual relationship with some without knowing they are married and they would have not proceed with sex had they known, this is fraud and rape. Same with deriving consent on pretext of marriage. Majority of women in India would not consent for sex if they know the person isn't going to marry. That's the GROUND reality. That's a valid argument. If a man consent to have sex with on pretext that woman will eventually marry, that man would not have consented to sex if he knew girl has not intention to marry, that my friend is classic case of fraud - deriving consent by withholding information that would change the consent. Fraud in sexual relationship is basically rape. Our law don't recognise this another debate. Wait a second, You have an option for that. Don't have sex before marriage. Let's say the guy has promised you marriage tell him you will indulge post marriage not prior. Indian customs already have a remedy for these types of fraud. That is why in small towns , Women are married of early by 16 because that's when the sexual hormones are raging in both genders. There has to be some burden on the women too. Only holding man accountable makes it seem like only the guy is getting pleasure out of it and the woman is at the receiving end of the stick! Here is what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_deception) says: \"Rape by deception is a situation in which the perpetrator deceives the victim into participating in a sexual act to which they would otherwise not have consented, had they not been deceived. Deception can occur in many forms, such as illusory perceptions, false statements, and false actions.\" This is not as black and white as the non-consensual sex rape and does need to be taken case by case. In your example, it can be considered rape because had it not been for the promise of getting the role, the aspiring actor would not have slept with the producer, especially if the producer knew when they were promising the role and having sex that they would, in fact, not be giving the role to the aspiring actor (which can be hard to prove). However, in this case, it might be easier to prove rape by coercion than rape under false pretense, but I digress. It cannot really be equated to prostution because in prostution, in the end, the transaction is completed when the prostitute gets paid. The same can be said about someone lying about their age to get sex, especially if the person lying is a minor. This then becomes a rape under false pretense vs statutory rape case which can go either way based on evidence provided. In another case, if a couple are having sex under the assumption that they will be getting married in the future but later break up, that, in general, cannot be considered rape because it is assumed that bother parties didn't lie when they promised to get married ([Source](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-warns-against-misusing-rape-laws-in-failed-relationship-cases-emphasizes-consent-and-consequences-101692641360835.html)). Again, all of this is very nuanced and no one can make a blanket statement of whether it is right or wrong. Sex is commodified. That commodity can be cheated under false pretense. Such law should be gender neutral. Acha bhai hoga par up me to nahi hai na hi bihar me itna common hai mai gaon me hi pala badha hu. Aaj bhi ladkiyon ki shaadi 12th class se pehle kara dete hain log, maine to itna nahi suna pre marital sex ke baare me, par ho sakta hai mai galat hu aur aap sahi. LoL incel spotted, opinion rejected Having consensual sex isn't rape but is the sex really 'consensual' if he lied about wanting to marry her. If she cheats or becomes abusive then he should be able to leave and not be charged with rape even if he said he would marry. If a man doesn't intend on marrying then all he has to do is to not promise marriage and find someone willing to have sex without promise of marriage. Does a person not need to know the circumstances under which they consent to sex? > people have problems in their lives, relationships don't work out. Every other major culture except india has figured this out. Don't promise to marry or clearly say that you don't have intention to marry. That you will inform the person, in future, when you have that intention. This is one of the first thing I tell the girls within 1-2 dates AND majority of them have walked away. It would be fraud on my part to lead them with false pretext. Unless there's a witness who can confirm that he said it, it won't stand and that won't be taken as evidence that he did say it. > There's consideration on each side, the girl would agree to sex because there's promise of marriage? In India, that's how it is? Tell most of the girls on first date that you have no intention of marrying them today. That opinion may change in future but today's that is not the case. They would not go on 2nd date. A lot of men will also behave like that. Sure, today's generation is more receptive to casual dating but majority are not. Gets mad when you receive the taste of your own medicine?🤣 The law doesn't take responsibility for their bad decisions. It takes responsibility for coercion and manipulation. If an institution doesn't pay a man money agreed upon, he can still file a case against them. If the woman knew that he wouldn't marry, had sex and regrets it, then he can't be held responsible as he never said that he would marry. This isn't about making 'bad decisions', it's being manipulated. >**^(1)****\\[****^(2)****\\[375. Rape.**-- A man is said to commit \"rape\" if he-- (a) penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or (b) inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the penis, into the vagina, the urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or (c) manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus or any part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or (d) applies his mouth to the vagina, anus, urethra of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person, under the circumstances falling under any of the following seven descriptions: *First*.Against her will. *Secondly*.Without her consent. *Thirdly*.With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested, in fear of death or of hurt. *Fourthly*.With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married. *Fifthly*.With her consent when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent. *Sixthly*.With or without her consent, when she is under eighteen years of age. *Seventhly*.When she is unable to communicate consent. *Explanation 1*.For the purposes of this section, \"vagina\" shall also include labia majora. *Explanation 2*.Consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement when the woman by words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication, communicates willingness to participate in the specific sexual act: Provided that a woman who does not physically resist to the act of penetration shall not by the reason only of that fact, be regarded as consenting to the sexual activity. *Exception 1*.A medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape. *Exception 2*.Sexual intercourse Thats still not fraud as the intent to marry can also go away just because someone man or woman changed his / her mind about marriage doesnt mean that he raped someone thats not how consent works Then don't have sex? Nobody is holding them at gunpoint that would be a seperate offence. Why make it quid pro quo? that's 30% So when a woman cheats a man on date into paying her full tab, isn't that manipulation too? She promises to marry and date but ghosts. Plenty girls and women do that, give hope of marriage to young boys and men, make them pay and then leave. If they knew, they wouldn't do that either. Then there should be a law for that too. The pigs justifying this law are essentially saying men doesn't have right to break up . Is it right pigs? No just made me laugh. You suck at \"attacks\". > If “resisting” was a prerequisite, then raping an unconscious person wouldn’t be rape. There are many forms of rape that don’t have additional violence tacked on: drugging someone, statutory rape, and indeed, uninformed consent. To help you see it in a less gendered way: if a woman said she is infertile to a man who didn’t want kids, and he agrees to sex only because of that, then he was raped. The only nugget of sense in your post is that rape laws should be gender-neutral. Coward. It's a deflection. Answer this straight. Does men have right to break up with women after sex or not? Swine? Answer it. >Any five year old with working brain cells can tell that this law is made to be misused It's amazing to see lowest tier gene pool morons defending the law here > OP, use the internet to educate yourself. Educate? Moron. So you are saying that men doesn't have right to break up. >Had the other person known there was no intention of marriage, would the girl give consent? Nope So after sex, there's no right to break up for men? You blithering moron. You also use the internet to educate yourself. >in rural areas, women who have had sex before marriage are shamed brutally, socially boycotted and in worst cases, get killed. forget about sex before marriages, even relationships are considered taboo, which is not true in case of men. So don't have sex? Why are they having sex before marriage? You talk like cheating, sex outside marriage, pre marital sex doesn't happen in rural India. Morons like you have the voting right and probably breed too. That's the scary part 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ did you not reckon the term “consent” ? Even if you have sex with a women on the prospect of marriage, and you are intending on doing so but something comes up about her that you may not have known before which could sway your decision or make you go back on your promise of marriage. But now just because you have a consensual sex, does that obligate you to marry that woman ? That’s just utterly ridiculous. This law is made to ridicule a man. If a woman is not sure if he’ll follow through on his promise. Just say no to premarital sex all together. That’s a bs law. So you're tryna stop women from having sex rather than wanting society to improve and men to stop lying to women in order to get into their pants? Damn makes perfect sense. The fact that misogynists like you exist is the reason why India will never be safe for women. Cheating and sex outside marriage is an immoral act period. You deserve to be called out and shamed for it no matter if you're in a metro city or some tier 4 city. Whereas sex is a basic human need. The fact that you're comparing cheating and a basic thing like sex says a lot about you. I feel sorry for the women around you. Men don't like it when women say no to sex . Then he can (or should be able to) make her pay it back if she was using him for money >So you're tryna stop women from having sex rather than wanting society to improve and men to stop lying to women in order to get into their pants? Damn makes perfect sense. The fact that misogynists like you exist is the reason why India will never be safe for women. How many brain cell you have? No is stopping . If a man, after having conseual sexual relationship coming to know that the women is a POS like you with out 2 brain cells, he has a right to break up. Yes or no. Answer it straight, coward. Men have right to opt out of pregnancy by wearing a condom while having sex. I cannot stoop down to your level. Then what would be the difference between filthy you and me? Yucks So you marital rap victim should stay silent? Rape victim never got their desired justice and people worry about fake cases Rape victim never got their desired justice and people worry about fake cases Based Bihari! Apart from stating the obvious did you even read the comment I was replying to or the particular example that was cited? Is the context lost on you or are you being obtuse for no reason? Tell me one rape victim who got deserved justice >SOME CHILD TO BE MANIPULATED.... Get out of your bubble Who has falsely accused men and ruined their life in the twox sub? This east not for beginners 💀 >I cannot stoop down to your level You're already below me, dumbo. And why do you keep coming back? Move on. What if the woman is lying about promise of marriage? Sexual violence against men is also a problem. It is not recognised in the country, so we don’t hear of these cases. You are indulging in confirmation bias. > and fraud leading to sex is rape. you literally missed the whole point of this thread. Manufactured consent is not true consent. Don't promise marriage if you can't make and keep them instead of manipulating people. Also, it's not about keeping one's legs closed (it's not about having sex), it's about wanting to have sex with or losing virginity to their life partner. > The terms under which the consent was given has changed, therefore its non consensual. this is incorrect, and is the crux of the problem. consent is consent. you cannot retroactively withdraw consent under any circumstances. what you are talking about is only fraud. YOU=“resisting” was a prerequisite, then raping an unconscious person\"... Unconscious person can't give consent and r...e was committed during unconscious state to thwart resistance hence it is r...e Ok. So suppose a girl was full-on in on sex and it was mutual but later files fake case against the boy saying that the boy did it forcefully. Looks like the law will believe on the girl and the boy has to prove his innocence. But if the boy has video proof of the deed and that clearly proves that the boy didn’t use force at all, will the court consider it or there will be more trouble for boy for why he has a video clip of the deed? Yeah do we have a law for it? We have a law for fuckbois but not for golddiggers Not all men; maybe just the ones you hangout with? 🤔 lol..so u mean wonen are less intelligemt thats why they can be manipulated..qhile men cant here nobody is talking about real rapes I've heard that women's minds do not work based on logic; it works based on emotions - sometimes benefitting humanity, and sometimes manipulating, hurting, or irritating. (It's a generalization. There are women who are the exact opposite too) if the gurl values her vriginity so much...if she is that traditional she has option to refuse and report harrasment...but if u sleep at ur will...no way playing victim card then do you see village girls signing contracts? bc i don't. id repeat myself again it's not raoe it's coercion. you can either look it up or bark How is it coercion? She isn't being forced, just because you found a new word you like doesn't mean you have to use it every sentence buddy. She is doing it by choice, no one is forcing her. By your logic a woman should have no rights after all according to you they are all naive retards with no ability to comprehend anything and thus unable to make any decisions on their own without being manipulated into it. Same girl. Males make so many fake promises. Back when I was young, I had sex with a man because he claimed to be very wealthy, after he got into my pants all that turned out to be a lie. All his accomplishments and money were fake. I felt raped. But sadly our country is misogynistic and there's no law against this kind of predatory behaviour. Yeah. It's all men's fault and they have the gall to blame us, the victims! Males are the ones raping us while we are extremely oppressed in the patriarchy. 😍 did i not write this law can be easily misused or do you lack basic understanding? so cute OP is drunk on the western eastern culture divide Considering consensual sex as rape is the stupidest thing. It can be termed cheating if the consent was obtained on the basis of false promises like a job offer or marriage. But calling it rape trivializes actual rape. Same laws apply everywhere though. The laws are soo shitty, I guess this comes under misrepresentation which would not be free consent, still stupid. But marital rape isn't a thing >that's only for urban 10% population. 33-36% of India lives in an Urban environment, not 10%. Answer the damn question what is ur question? i never said marital rape is ok......jus as u oppose marital rape also oppo unsensical biased laws against men...cause gender equality should happen from both side.... lol, seemingly your parents taught you no manners. Anybody can comment on anything that passes the test of common sense and reasonableness. You have nothing to say about the merits of the argument, instead your point is that I need to live in India to make any comment about any non sensical laws. i never talked about real rape here.....talking about consensual sex which is termed as rape >they r \"ADULT\" IF THEY SLEEP WITH CONSENT....ITS THEUR CHOICE...THEY R NOT SOME CHILD TO BE MANIPULATED.... >never said marital rape is ok 😑👁️ >Rape victim never got their desired justice did they? ur post is off the topic...nobosy here is opposing laws against real r..e..... what u r doing is called red herring what? what do u mean? u r really a man hating illogical person...what does it has to do about the topic being dicussed here? REAL RA..S SHOULD BE PUNISHED CONSENSUAL SEX SHOULD NOT BE CALLED RAPE Yes you kind of do. There are ground realities here that are radically different from America. The premise of your argument is wrong and not based in fact. So an Indian citizen can have no opinion about Ukraine, or Iraq or ISIS or the Nazis? Because they never lived through the holocaust, an Indian can say nothing about the evils of Nazis? Ok, Sherlock. That’s not how reason and common sense works. No dumb dumb. Anyone can have an opinion on anything. The point is to have an informed opinion. An opinion based on an understanding of the issue. In depth. You who don't live here and are unaware of the social situation can have your opinion. It's just an ill informed one. Speaking of Nazis, do you know a large number of Indians admire Hitler? Yeah. Weird. The hell are you talking about? Have you not heard of \"honor killings\" ? Is that worse than gender neutral laws? ya both men and women are killed ....in many cases girls family kill the boy..... but it has to do with the topic we r discussing? So….sounds like you support a law that makes it illegal to have premarital consensual sex? Got it! A modern day Vivekananda you are! You aren't just \"asking\" for gender neutral laws here. No that's not what I'm saying. And no that's not what the law says. Just read the law and why the law exists. Like i said anyone will agree that laws related to rape should extend to men. Reading and comprehension is fundamental \"Having consensual sex isn't rape but is the sex really 'consensual' if he lied about wanting to marry her.\" Yes it is because during the act, she said yes, and that's what matters. \"If she cheats or becomes abusive then he should be able to leave and not be charged with rape even if he said he would marry.\" This is where the loophole lies. What if she cheats or becomes abusive but also charges him and frames him as the bad guy? You guys should definitely have a look about consent. There is no such thing as a manufactured consent. It's either a Yes or a No. Anything in between is a No. If she agreed and said yes, she can revoke consent during sex but not months after they had it. Not when she suddenly regrets it. There has been thousands of cases where the woman has had consensual sex and then months after, for whatever reason, regrets it and frames him as r@pist. In what world do you think it's fair? what is the problem to scrap gender bias laws..? For a country obsessed with virginity , It's a very big deal. nobody gonna do anything to u if u r not...and why do u need validation from other MEN There is no such thing as a manufactured consent. You either give consent or you Don't. Yes Or No. \"Also, it's not about keeping one's legs closed (it's not about having sex), it's about wanting to have sex with or losing virginity to their life partner.\" You just proved my point with this statement. You wanna have sex with your life partner, so have sex when you get married, if that's your thing. Any random guy who talks to you for 4 days isn't your life partner. No matter how hard he makes you believe that. Promising marriage might be fraud, but it is never r@pe because both of the parties, before and during the act, agreed and gave consent. As I said, regret is not r@pe. You can't just decide one day that the sex that you had 10 years ago with a guy, is now r@pe just because you regret it. It doesn't work that way. It's like having a business together, but when you split, you sue the other company because of whatever reason. It's hypocrisy because you both enjoyed the profit. As far as sex goes, It all depends on you. Nothing is right or wrong. If you wanna have sex with your boyfriend before marriage, it's fine. It doesn't make you a w#ore or a sl*t. It's literally human need and there's nothing wrong with that. You just have to keep in mind that there's a possibility that you and your boyfriend might break up in the future because future is unpredictable. In case you do break up, you don't get to decide one day to that the sex that you had with him is r@pe, because at the time, you were both into it. If you wanna have sex after marriage, that's fine too. Just stick to your standards and just because some guy pressures you, don't have it. It's not worth it. Dump his ass, or complaint about it to the police. If you decide to have sex, remember it's your choice as much as it's his choice. Ok boss. U progressive. I bad. Forgiven me. 🫡 🙏 He can show evidence that she cheated or became abusive. Manufactured consent is a thing, consent under false circumstances is that. There have been even more cases where men actually raped the woman and got away with it. Being misused is no reason to not have laws. She can have child with another person, but you're still the father. You should read how many women are killed by men when they said no to their proposal .it's very common You're bullsh#ting and you know that! I agree with your 3rd para though, 99% cases go unreported in India. Does a person not need to know the circumstances under which they consent sex? If pressured, yes. But as I said, you can't agree mutually and then change your decision years later. Doesn't the same thing apply to the guy who promised marriage >fraud is only fraud. only rape is rape. What does it even mean? So, you can get consent by lying (fraud), have sex and it is not rape? Bro, what are you smoking? >Then don't have sex? I mean, yea! No sex so no rape. Problem is literally doing sex after withholding information/intention. >as the intent to marry can also go away Bro. For all practical purpose, tell your intentions of marriage the day you are ready to legally marry the same day. How difficult is that? >You have an option for that. Don't have sex before marriage. Let's say the guy has promised you marriage tell him you will indulge post marriage not prior What do you think happen in India anyway? Women don't indulge in pre-marital sex for the reason Indian men use marriage promise quite loosely. All I'm saying is it aint rape in either case no matter if a man does it or a woman does it . Its a free choice , a choice that shouldn't be tampered with I am losing my brain cells. Have a great day! In a country where pre marital sex is not acceptable, where a women may not consent to sex had she known men don't have intention to marry, it definitely make sense to call this rape. Good good now tell me how do you read someones intention ? You didn't get the comment. Girls don't have to make it a quid pro quo at all, it should not be part of the equation. Avg baby girl trying to sound big Why did you delete your 4 paragraph rant with abusive words? SS already taken. That was not me baby girl… That was some one else that you pissed with your misandry. I just hope your that the man you love gets the same taste of your misandry by some other women. Your ss doesn’t mean shit to anyone kid Tera Baap pehle marega That’s fraud , not rape. You agreed to have sex with the person. Resist when they can , or consent ? You can enjoy sex with someone and later say ‘I didn’t consent’ . Are you expecting men to record proof of consent ? Well then don't go out wanting to marry such men? I know; Is it \"common\" though? How many cases do we get per year? How dare you point out facts like that? 😂 It's not always as cut and dry as that, unfortunately. Sometimes the consent can be coerced, they can take back consent during the act, maybe they were blackmailed into saying yes, maybe they were unconscious and couldn't give consent at all. And yes, it can also be the case of someone fully and consensually enjoying the sex and then falsely accusing the other party/ies of rape. Which is why cases are and should be taken case by case instead of saying blanket statements like \"this law is stupid and will be misused and thus should not become a law at all.\" It's very hard to get any real data in india because uts not reported properly. He said this exactly. That's unfortunate. Unless people report crimes confidently, the officials can't take action. It's unfortunate that our women are happy to learn all kinds of nonsense in the name of women empowerment, but fail to learn the core things that matter. You think official take action ? Do you know conviction rate of rapist in india ? You have no idea about ground reality . Ground reality is that courts walk on a minefield, trying to solve these cases. Because of the many false cases, slowing down the entire system. Nothing to do with court .most rapist are not caught by the lazy police . Instead they question the rape victim and blame her . Police will and should ask questions before filing any case. What is your problem with that? To make the women feel comfortable, the police department appoint women officers for interactions with women. What more do you expect? Have you ever been to police station ? Check the number of false cases even in the lower courts. If a girl goes to an advocate, they are gonna make false cases for sure blindly. WT hell is that?? Extra marital affairs are legal for women. Affairs are legal for women. But When it's about taking accountability, women are kids, Is it?? If they do wrong, both should be punished. period. Also number of actual rape cases filed by innocent women are very very low because of our fucked up socio economic and caste status. Innocent women helpers are raped in interior states like haryana, UP and Bihar. Do you think they are filing cases?? Do something about that instead of supporting vile women who make money using law. Defrauding someone to have sex with you is rape. How hard is to for you to understand. Sometimes it boggles my mind how fellow men just don't grasp basic concept of social relationships. Yes, why No it’s not rape. There was consent. People should do their research before consenting if that’s so important to them. If you don't need to be married to have sex, then stop linking sex with 'promise of marriage'. If somebody had sex because they were promised a Lamborghini and then they didn't get it, it's not rape. It's just fraud. If you invert the law, what it would mean is that if a man seduced a woman once, she is now bound by contract forever to marry him, and can only be released from him if he wishes to do it. So, if a couple has sex, either of them can force the other to participate in a marriage? This is utterly ridiculous. This law is nonsense. Dafuq does this mean - withholding information/intention Does a man need to undergo a polygraph every time before he is intimate with a woman? Does that make any sense? > Does a man need to undergo a polygraph every time before he is intimate with a woman? Does that make any sense? Are you the person who usually dishonest with your intentions when dealing with other people? Usually it is concern of people who actually intend to be dishonest in first place. No you are just whining about \"western\", \"premarital\" and other nonsense. >what is the problem to scrap gender biased illogical laws..? Who said anything about gender biased laws should not be scrapped? What's \"illogical\" with a rape law? But rural areas also have 'live in\" relationships! Also girls family kills the girl. Generally a girl is more likely to face problems. Boys actions are usually excused with something like \"boys will be boys\". u need to come out of the tv world and see the reality consensual sex cannot be termed rape Rape is by defnition not consensual. I am commenting from reality. You are commenting based on what you read from what's app University Hey I will tell you something better . I put morphine in your cup , I did not tell you , you drink that cup , you did not have the authority to choose whether to drink morphine or not . If you consumed morphine you were unable to exercise your choice over whether to consume that morphine or not . Or exercise your choice over your consumption of morphine in your body . I tell you to drink that morphine and in return I give you reward . You were able to exercise your choice over the consumption of morphine in your body . Now if the task of consuming morphine was a service or you faced loss because of it and it is rightful to expect a reward for it . It is called the theft or service . You were able to exercise full consent or the power to say yes or no over the glass . Whether nor not it is consensual is determined by whether not the parties where able to exercise their consent over the ACT not once you exercise your consent over the act some reward will be given or not . Lets take a prostitute who was not given money in return for her services. Here you were able to exercise your consent over the acts to be done on you , you were allowed to exercise your consent over things related to your body . You were not able to choose or did not choose the situation where you would be cheated out of your reward or something in return for that . You can say your reward was taken from you and you had no choice in the matter of getting or not getting the reward . Then comes the fact if he is liable to pay you a reward for whatever you did . The example you mentioned about infertility no that still is not rape , sexual assault is if any acts were done to you without your agency or without you choosing them . Stealthing is rape because you are removing a condom and that act becomes a different act . An act which is different to what was said was performed on you . Rape on pretext of marriage or gifts is not rape , if it was it would be a law in most developed countries it is a more similar law to seduction which existed in victorian england ."
