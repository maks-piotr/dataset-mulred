Well a puppet dictator  .\n\n\nAnd why the chottogram manipur region is so lucrative- maybe theres lithium or gold , i dont know why they will destabilize that place eitherwise. Cant think of any other mineral that is lucrative . Maybe it could be uranium because the  france monetary empire of east africa- many states including niger  have refused to sell france uranium in recent times and even got russia and  got wagner and some other mercenary  group there\n\n\nEitherway  modi or rahul gandhi whoever the pm is ( say today ) , none would talk about it because you know what cia did to a lot of our predessor pms.

        "This is a house in Kumujamba in Churachandpur and Kumujamba was a hotspot for drugs, local made liquor and illegal activities. It was illegally occupied by the Meitei community who claimed they cant own land in the hills and which is the reason why the violence started but now they suddenly do own land in the hills. r/manipur has been one sided just as the local media is and was from the start of the conflict and which in turn influenced the national media. The meiteis will always try to claim the hindu angle and will also say they are fighting against illegal immigrants and drugs and support the chief minister of Manipur but in reality they the conflict is between all the non nagas vs the meiteis because they butchered many non nagas in 3rd May in imphal when the violence erupted in the border of a meitei village and a kuki village. You wont see this in the national media because the Meiteis are actively trying to bury the truth with misinformation. I have no hate against the meitei community but they are easily swayed by false propaganda. Honestly there are drug smugglers and illegal immigrants in every community and illegal poppy farmers too but the Kukis get the brunt of the allegations even though the meitei community and the naga community are doing it too. The state govt who cant keep a check on the illegal immigration and drug smuggling is to blame and not a particular community.",
        "I am not very well versed in the conflict but do know an average amount and r/manipur does seem very one sided. Its filled with posts throwing around the word 'Kuki terrorists' here and there. In my experience, people who are very eager to shout someone out as terrorists often have something to hide themselves.",
        "Definitely and I understand why they would be  that way since they cant speak up or they will get phone call from a particular civil organisation asking to meet up because they commented this and that against the narrative.",
        "Kumujamba is a meitei village in Chrachandpur district of Manipur. It is an area surrounded by the Kukis tribes. Within the last two decades the demography of Churachandpur district have changed significantly with the arrival of kukis illegal immigrants from Myanmar and the rampant destruction of forest for poppy plantation. The kukis do not pay any land tax while the meitei villages comes under the state land revenue  and are patta holders paying land taxes. These villages are the first to be targeted as these are the prime spot, you can see the other guy telling it's a hotspot for liquor and drugs, well how can you justify a controlled bomb demolition, give them the lie that it was a bad place so we destroying it. No meiteis village are standing in Kukis with no sign about civilization while the houses of Kukis are still standing tall in Imphal under the protection of security.",

        "Well, you did miss the initial days of the violence when internet was banned. Fact is when internet was banned in entire state propaganda was running from Churachandpur through internet connection from a bank. Speaking of r/manipur you should have seen the amount of propaganda and disinformation being posted.",
        "On the contrary a mod who was deleting and banning users posting the facts when internet was banned all in favour of kuki. Was finally kicked out. No more disinformation or propaganda.",
