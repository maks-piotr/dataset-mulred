        "That's a different topic altogether everybody does that call it marketing/PR/propaganda whatever that happens everywhere, but here the fact that we have the freedom to damage the property like that ...isn't it unfair towards the government?? It's so easy to blame everything on them but we gotta see other side of the story too. So many people would have worked their ass off for this project for what??to see all these Tobacco stains??",
        "There‚Äôs not even a zilch of civic sense in people. I don‚Äôt know why people in our country love to live around filth.",
        "That's exactly what I hate about democracy, it kills the ability to take strong decisions. Imagine this happening in China , Russia or any gulf country",
        "The government should employ adequate cleaning staff. Tax money is currently being wasted",
        "So basically tobacco shouldn't be banned or the people who spat on government properties shouldn't be heavily taxed... instead we should hire more people to clean it.. that's what you're saying right??üòë",
        "OP completely ignored european democracies which are clean and people have civic sense!!!\n\nThis is not a democracy issue. This is civic sense issue. Literally,  autocratic governments usually fair worse in terms of corruption. If there is any consolation, look at USSR.",
        "You're missing the point what the post is about, it about treating these individuals rather than blaming everything on the government. And the fact that having a democracy just makes it difficult to create a civic sense in these people.",
        " ‚ÄúOne of the penalties of refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.‚Äù  \n‚Äï **Plat**",
        "I understand that. And I agree to the point that when it comes to public property, we cannot blame govt alone.\n\nBut my point is, inculcating civic sense has nothing to do with democracy. Example, assume an autocratic state like USSR with rampant corruption, you'd still see idiots with license after paying 2k and no test. And you are back to square one with a tyrant as a leader.",
        "Literal Shithole country.",
        "This is the mindset that has screwed this country beyond repair.",
        "But most of them adopted democracy much later. Mere republic is not democracy. In Europe, when age of enlightenment came, they were under monarchy. Japan saw growth due to Meiji restoration. Nearly every government has a dictatorial phase where decision has been made against people wishes for long term betterment",

        "Democracy has no fault in it. Indians generally live in filth. This is a civic issue on personal level. People learn this from their home. Indians casually litter wherever they are. \n\nFor example: If someone buys a pack of chips, their hand will offload the packet as soon as the chips end. This is filthy.",
        "Such massive infrastructure construction boom and still \"Tax Money is being wasted\"??? And anyways these things are on people more than the govt. People in India lack civic sense.¬†",
        "We need a just leader which can't be possible in democracy because every leader has to pander to some group here",

        "Can't disagree.",
        "You're right to some extent but after seeing posts from California, pennsylvania, Paris, major parts of Italy, London and Lisbon...i think it's a very common issue tbh and only strong penalty is required in order to create it",
        "Yeah, and that group can be children who wants go study, people who wants to work, people who want survive but are unable to. But politics in India thinks only by birth association such as religion and caste are groups. There are problems faced by most that can be focused and can be classified as groups",
        "Yeah, it's all going to corrupt politicians pockets",
        "Just create a single party government like a cricket team where the best of the best politicians from their respective field take charge, no voting , no PR....hell I'm even down for an AI Goverment once AGI is achieved.",

Well we turn our face away with disgust, point our fingers at government ( like I did ), or to blame our fellow Indians for their lack of civic sense. Instead of shifting blame if we take matters in our own hands and make it our duty to clean such places when we see them, perhaps India will be a lot cleaner and such incidents will also decrease.
