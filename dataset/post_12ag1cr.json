FML, these idiots do make feeling even an ounce of national identity or pride impossible as each day goes on. Without the Mughals, there's no India. Period.\n\nThe north Indian identity is built around the Mughals. There's nothing about the north Indian identity today that hasn't been influenced directly or indirectly by the stability and effluence provided by the Mughal regime, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries. The languages, the cuisine, the architecture, the economic centres, the arts, the costumes etc are all significantly impacted by the Mughal court and its influence on regional courts and cultures through the remarkable unification and centralised integration. No Mughals, no Delhi and Agra as central towns, no Bengal as the pre-eminent pre-industrialised subah that propelled the subcontinent to being the biggest producer and trader in the world economy, no strong centralisation that gave rise to the economic and pan-Indian conditions for linguistic, artistic, culinary and architectural efflorescence, and the colonisation by the Europeans would have been pushed back into the 1600s instead of the 1800s. The Mughals were only the second dynasty in the long 5000 years of the subcontinent to unify and hold more than half of it under a stable and thriving government lasting longer than a lifetime, so if there is an idea of a unified India or a cultural connection between the varied and individual peoples of the subcontinent, then the Mughals played a not insignificant role in it.",

        "Oh, the damage is already done. Whether they are in power or not, the decay is going to continue. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry to be so pessimistic, but I‚Äôll tell you the reasons for my opinion. Right now, bjp has polarized the country well enough touching key sentiments like religion. Regardless of our liking, people have been hypnotized. If they are voted out of power, people will have a soft spot in their minds. Anti-incumbency will help them regain power in 5+ years. They‚Äôll then continue the work of social destruction. If they come to power next May, the pause won‚Äôt be there and their work will continue. Unless people suffer to an extent that they hate any mention of bjp to their core, their divisive work will keep reaping the benefits. So the society itself needs a complete overhaul and rebuild from hubris. Small fixes are just patchwork that can‚Äôt hold for long.\n\nAt least for the freedom struggle, there was a common enemy that the people united against. Now, that‚Äôs not the case. It‚Äôs harder fighting the stupid people than having an ideological fight with bjp. The gullible people are their meat shield and they aren‚Äôt insignificant in numbers. We can‚Äôt enforce critical thinking until people take a step back and realize that something is off with the current path. People have to initiate the change from within themselves. \n\nIt is possible that my view on the alternate path next year (electing a non-bjp govt) isn‚Äôt considering other positives and we may get better results than what I‚Äôm fearing. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs in store for us.",

It doesn't take more than a few years to change economic progress to stop its course. And  the worst part is a large portion of our country is so brainwashed and backward that they consider modern enlightenment values bad and want to go back to some mythical  past.

NCERT books pretty much ignore South and North East India Oh, the damage is already done. Whether they are in power or not, the decay is going to continue. I‚Äôm sorry to be so pessimistic, but I‚Äôll tell you the reasons for my opinion. Right now, bjp has polarized the country well enough touching key sentiments like religion. Regardless of our liking, people have been hypnotized. If they are voted out of power, people will have a soft spot in their minds. Anti-incumbency will help them regain power in 5+ years. They‚Äôll then continue the work of social destruction. If they come to power next May, the pause won‚Äôt be there and their work will continue. Unless people suffer to an extent that they hate any mention of bjp to their core, their divisive work will keep reaping the benefits. So the society itself needs a complete overhaul and rebuild from hubris. Small fixes are just patchwork that can‚Äôt hold for long. At least for the freedom struggle, there was a common enemy that the people united against. Now, that‚Äôs not the case. It‚Äôs harder fighting the stupid people than having an ideological fight with bjp. The gullible people are their meat shield and they aren‚Äôt insignificant in numbers. We can‚Äôt enforce critical thinking until people take a step back and realize that something is off with the current path. People have to initiate the change from within themselves. It is possible that my view on the alternate path next year (electing a non-bjp govt) isn‚Äôt considering other positives and we may get better results than what I‚Äôm fearing. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs in store for us. Indians will go from dumb to dumber. BJP vote share will increase. What really happened is less important than fictional story... Big bang happened in 2014 üòÇ. Mudi ji caused it. Mudi ji is god. I don't know that with the old syllabus lol. But I'd guess Babur? They were fighting asuras from pathaal. Be happy they are not teaching ramayan and mahabharat as history for now, but can expect in near future if they win the 2024 election again. ü•¥ This is hindu Pakistanisation of India. If you look at Pakistan' s history whatever we are doing now they have done it in the past and has resulted in them being in a pile of shit and one of the most isolated countries in the world. It doesn't take more than a few years to change economic progress to stop its course. And the worst part is a large portion of our country is so brainwashed and backward that they consider modern enlightenment values bad and want to go back to some mythical past. If this goes on 30-40 years down the line we will be making podcasts on YouTube and cry about how it all went wrong like our neighbours are doing right now. Partially correct. Babur paved the way for Mughal Empire by winning Panipat. The final nail in the coffin of Delhi Sultanate was put by Akbar. First they marginalize history and then share fake history on Whatsapp. Moodi ji obviously Be careful ..you might get 2 years sentence of jail ü§£ Well don't take my knowledge for benchmark tho I was never much interested in History/Civics/SST üòë Matlab ki... bass leni deni karni haaa Why stop there? Change the name of Ahmedabad to something hindu-ish Mughals are not just a part of Indian history. Mughals ARE the Indian history. They even removed topics about Democracy: > Chapters on 'Democracy and diversity', 'Popular struggles and movement', and 'Challenges to democracy' have been dropped from the Class 10 'Democratic Politics-II' textbook. In this age of 4g , youtube and others . Really doesn't matter . India has too much diversity to have one view point dominate others ‚ÄúEvery record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.‚Äù George Orwell, 1984 Why do we underestimate our kids. Only way not to make mistakes of the past is to know about the past. The year is 2028, a class 9 student goes on a school trip around Delhi. After seeing red fort, qutub minar, safdarjung tomb, Humayun's tomb, isa Khan's tomb & lodhi garden tombs he asks who built these monuments, and is immediately sent to jail under UAPA for being an anti-national element. Our history is so beautiful. Please don‚Äôt destroy it. Wtf? Why Equations of Motions?? Invisible history of rajputs being great warriors Amdavad is how the locals pronounce it and some people even suggest changing the official spelling to that I move to Canada last decade, got my parents here, and slowly getting siblings here too. Good fucking riddance. The funny thing being Pakistan once more liberal and a darling of the west with a high ppp and gdp numbers than India before liberalization. India moving fast there. wow, they are ruining youth's education too. fuck, we are truly in the endgame Only the good guys ever win in History books. Seems fishy. Actually majority of people wanted mughal chapter to be removed for long time. Whoever disagree is in minority so we don't have much say in the matter. Most of folks are praising this I wonder who build the Taj Mahal??? ab equation of motions se unko kya problem hai? If they have to remove chapters on Mughal Rulers, then its clear indication of hate. Then probably they should make all those monuments free, why collect any fees? Lodhi garden has like ‚Çπ40 for entry, and ‚Çπ100 rupee fine if you lose the that RFID coin, foreign traveler pay like ‚Çπ300. They earn bucket load on Taj Mahal and then call it Tejmohlay or whatever shit. You can say that my rant is unrelated but hey these degenerates cant see their hypocrisy. Mythology is pretty soon going to be history. Thats coming. Damage of the last decade will take another decade or more to undo. No one, not even hardcore bhakths think Savarkar is father of nation. That is the title they give to Subhash Chandra Bose. And i agree. Canada is becoming a bigger shithole than India pal. I give it 10-15 years, before Trudeau and his party will turn Canada to an authoritarian utopian state. Look at all the recent bills passed by the canadian government. All i say is good luck. Ok that was another extreme and this is another one. Both are horrible. Who defeated the Mughals? Many CBSE students think that was British, when in reality Marathas beat them. So i feel this is over correction from distorted history taught to us. I dont agree with removing them. But they could have added all the other history they want to teach, and reduced Mughal chapters. You think Mughals were defeated by British in 1857? Those who control the present, control the past. Pakistan?! I don't understand how they will explain 250+ years of history without the Mughals, whether they hate it or not it's an important part of our history. Also, which excuse will they give to demolish mosques to make temples if there were no muslim rulers to demolish the \"previously\" temples. Maybe, 250 years of rule and leaving behind amazing architecture wasn't enough to be mentioned in history How are they going to explain Ram mandir? History doesn't change based on what people wish. Hey you anti national, it's not Taj Mahal it's Tajo mahalaya and it was built by mudi ze No no you got me wrong . What I meant was on YouTube and other social media everyone praising this but they don't see the bad effect it will have in future . But it's too late now He meant the indus Valley civilization area. That modern Pakistan area was common to all the northern Dynasties that we were taught in schools Taj Mahal's name to be changed. Now it will be called Modi mandir. It will still be better than Amrit Kaal Hindustan I guess. Although rn I feel the best country to migrate to will be Australia. Two of my nephews have already settled down here and they seem happy. Exactly what I feel. I feel if Congress had fought harder in 2019 they might have won back power and this whole restructuring of India's ethos, it's founding principles wouldn't have been trampled so badly. If you look back you would realise BJPee wasn't acting so aggressively during it's first term. It's only when they came back with a bigger majority in 2019 that they became emboldened to aggressively pursue their Agenda. Destruction of J&K, RAM mandir, Triple Talaq... All these were smokescreen to pursue their actual Heist.. That of selling India piece by piece to their Corporate Masters, While the majority including my own near and dear ones were jerking off to the pain of the minorities and other backward groups. Even the Lockdown disaster, Demo, GST hasn't opened the eyes of my fellow citizens. I don't know what will. 100% agree with this. In fact, people have been calling it out since 2018. It just fell on deaf ears. I‚Äôm crying out the exact same thing you are saying. What on this planet will wake them up? What‚Äôs so irritating is that I see well educated people doing this. Edit: /s Did we melt our brains with covid vaccines? SMH! Australia is better than Canada for sure. Nah.. I have taken all the 3 doses of covaxin and my brain is stil functioning alright. I should have added /s. Not needed. I knew you we're being sarcastic. üòÖ we can‚Äôt be too careful these days as it‚Äôs hard to differentiate if someone is sarcastic or being serious. We have been in such a state for a while. If we remove mughals and brit from history coz govt dont like it then what will left of history lol It will be fun to see how they describe the origin of the Taj Mahal. \"During the 16th century, a white marble structure suddenly appeared in Agra. Nobody knows who built it.\" Off Topic.. Thoda basic finance bhi include kardho.. please.. financially most of us are never ever aware of how to deal with it until reality hits us.. Oh I remember some discussion on this thought it was all a joke. Something about how ancient India had discovered them first. I hope this is not the real reason. ![gif](giphy|3oEjI789af0AVurF60) Nuts. Maybe initially, but it's the East India Company that eventually killed the Mughal Empire. their last king (Jafar) in Delhi. Well, dumbness might be overcompensated by overconfidence. But how do we remove 1000 years of history? If they hate mughals so much, why are mughal and british allies aka marwaris loved so much? marwaris funding British to take over the country replacing ghost rule.. Indus valley was special and had no kings. Moreover they probably migrated south to become Dravidians You got it wrong man. Marathas completely destroyed the Mughal empire not initially. Marathas had conquered land till afghanistan. British only started to take over because of infighting in Marathas. This is what i was talking about, the history was distorted to gain muslim votes. Let us say it what it is. Now BJP distorted it to gain Hindu votes. The politicians have put their claws in our education as well.
