It was a long video maybe between 30-60 mins long, no cringe bs, dude was just smart as fuck, seemed like a psychologist or something? My best guess is his channel is something on the likes of healthygamergg (Dr. K), and the dude was basically talking on how Andrew Tate hasn't really achieved anything meaningful in life and all his hard work and stuff is good but is worthless because he does it only for women and is basically a slave to his dick (his literal words) \nI really wanna watch that youtuber again so if any of yall know the video please lmk üò≠üôè",
