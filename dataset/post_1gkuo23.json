        "Bro there has been basically 0 hiring in government sector in last 6 years in railway, PRT teaching and negligible hiring in SSC mainly this is the middle class which consumes FMCG sector in urban areas. IT sector is struggling recently due to recession idk why government is surprised lol",
        "10 items in a basket ðŸ§º cost more as compared to last year. People are selective, trying out local options and cost cutting even on many things. People stopped services of companies offering high quality options instead the mood of the nation is to save , pay bills and pay emis. No more extra expenses , on top of that traders getting very expensive and margins going low so no more discount even on bulk these days. Govt wants to see in the positive economic numbers so they are not ready reduce any interest on anything. Fringe elements are on the rise and people hesitation for purchases everywhere.",
        "But the middle class will still vote for \"Saffron Vikas\", and becomes more poor in return...  Especially women from middle class house holds for a \"strong\" leader and become more poor in return...  To the entire focking middle class \"We deserve this only\" !!!!!!!!!!!!!",

        "Bro, everything is too costly these days and getting jobs is also becoming more difficult. People claiming there are no such issues are quietly fleeing to Western countries.",
