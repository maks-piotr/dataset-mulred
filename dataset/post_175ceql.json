        "Quite a popular scam this one since 2020. Nudes I guess are from some unfortunate people but they get all your contact info and contacts from your phone to whom they call, harass putting your name into the mud and dragging through it. IMHO people fear the most is public perception of them no matter how anonymous their life is.",
        "What if you buy a cheap android and don't hook it up to any of your social profiles..\nPut all fake contacts in the contact list..and give them all fake details (I don't know if they give loans without verification)\n\nTake the money and disappear..how will they get you?  \n\nUnless you have to provide proof of address to them or something.",
        "If the loan is of any significant amount, they will do KYC and get proof of address",
        "Yesâ€¦ theyâ€™re running this elaborate scheme and they havenâ€™t thought about that!\nNot to mention even with a money trail even police is often helpless.",
        "11549 rs?",
        "I mean if they're going to get my nudes, they'll probably send it back to me after throwing up",
        "Modern day loan gundas",
        "Exhibitionists: scammers are doing the heavy lifting......win win....",
        "Bro how do you take a loan for 50k and turn it into a 20 lakh loan? It's madness.",
        "Old timey gundas too had values. They wouldnâ€™t harass someone who has paid off the loan.",
        "Heavy interest gets levied that compounds daily.\n\nLike on 20000, 30% per day. Now calculate interest value on day 30.",
        "When you download apps, you give them a lot of them access to your contacts and photos, does this mean they can do this without you ever having taken a loan or sell this info to these call centres? If theyâ€™re harassing people who repaid loans, whatâ€™s to say they wonâ€™t harass people who never took a loan?",
        "Let's be honest stop caring \n\nWorld has moving very fast in internet \n\nThey probably lots of indency in social media on purpose for views\n\nWhy do any one will care after few days",
        "They won't approve your loan if you have few contacts in your phone and no photos. Thats the first access they take. Contacts and gallery.",
        "It's not about your nudees, they get access to your phone data and will make nudes of anyone from those images, Teri nudes to tu khud na dekhe.",
        "Sweet..then I'll download and keep a few pics of sunny ji (both Leonne and deol), maybe Tammanah, Shakti Kapoor and can't forget Pandey ji (the chunky one)",
        "I'm pretty sure it's not very difficult to download few pics and contacts off of the internet.",
        "How are you going to get contacts of a particular person off the net? You can get names maybe but phone numbers?",
        "everything mentioned except name of the app that one needs to stay away from ðŸ¤¡",
        "Itnii maths aati toh loan lene ki zaruurat nahi hoti",
        "It is mentioned. Asan loan",
        "random numbers?",
        "hmmmm thats not how it works, at all. maybe you wouldnâ€™t care about a third personâ€™s nudes, but people really do give a shit when it comes to nudes of a person they know. a nude scandal can destroy someoneâ€™s life especially if its a woman.",
        "Bro go to school",
        "As I was reading the article I recieved a message from Airtel about quick loan apps\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3ipkoh6sltb1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e35d3356196abe99e1663fc44da18fc38955bfe",
        "Yup, but that's just one. There are dozens out there.",
        ">When a customer takes out a loan... they give the app access to the contacts on their phone\n\nIf you're going to get a loan through a phone app, try to get a cheap burner phone first and use that instead.  But if you need a loan you prob can't afford that, either.  Whatever, hide your contact however you can.  Delete them all and keep them on paper until after you finish with the loan.\n\nOr, delete the contacts, get the loan, then delete the app.  Do something, don't let them get your contact.  Oh, and if they blackmail you with nudes tell your people first and hold your head up.   Don't kill yourself over this shit",
        ">  a nude scandal can destroy someoneâ€™s life especially if its a woman\n\nWhich is a serious problem!  There's no reason for that backwards shit to be going on in 2023.",
        "I agree with you.  Don't use a phone with your own contact in it",
        "Currently I am scamming these MOFOs who contact me to do fake reviews and them do prepaid task. In last month 2 of them have contacted me to do fake reviews and earn around 650 rs in 1 or 2 days then later they ask me to do prepaid task. At that point I just take my money amd leave. Not bad earning 1300 in 2 days. Easy money.",
        "30% daily pe loan kaun leta hai but?",
        "Your bank account could get flagged",
        "I have give my secondary account both the time. It has 0 rs now",
        "true but it is the reality, so better safe than sorry.",
        "Desperate people. During covid a lot of people went into loss, and even now during recession itâ€™s affecting crores of people",

        "The smarter ones have done this.\n\nGot a new phone number from jio in chennai and after a week started getting calls from a number saying my emi payments are due. They said someone's name and I clarified I got this number last month and there is no relation to the previous owner. Finally after a few months started getting calls from another number who started to threaten me by stating all of my supposed address and relation. None of them linked to me in any shape or form. So I said go ahead. The incessant calling made me cancel that number.\n\nSo people have successfully applied this before.",
        "Why not just take advantage of the AI hoolah and completely disarm the idea of nudes altogether. Society mein yeh phaila do ki AI se nudes banake blackmail hota hai. bas ab sabke pas valid excuse hai, ki humara nahin hai. kisi ne banaya hai.",

        "> so better safe than sorry\n\nHow is shame causing suicide the \"safe\" path?",
        "It happened in Pakistan a few months back. One of the man committed suicide as he was unable to pay and the scammers were calling his relatives.",
