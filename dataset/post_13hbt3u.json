        "What did they expect from Karnataka. This isn't UP or Bihar.",
        "But it does have the UP pockets like coastal Karnataka",
        "Well, obviously it is not UP or Bihar, but it is the only state in southern India where the BJP had a footprint... So, it isn't beyond the realm of possibility that the politics of hindutva and caste could well have worked out for the BJP. I am glad that it didn't, but such shit posting about UP and Bihar is unnecessary.",
        "There are many reasons for the Congress win and for this most fitting defeat of the BJP. \n\nI hope, this election helps the Congress to build momentum and forge coalitions before the central government elections next year.",
        "BJP failed to win a single ST reserved seat. Even their star leader Sriramulu lost. Their SC seat tally came down from 22 to 12. Looks like Dalits and Tribals are fed up of constant casteism of upper castes (who had BJP support), ever increasing petrol diesel lpg prices and rising hatred against them.",
        "bjp still has 36% vote share. the threat is far from over.\n\nhope ktk govt implements schemes like Delhi and Punjab govt and boot bjp out forever.",
        "The irony is that coastal karnataka is 100% literate (unlike in UP or the rest of karnataka), and are supposedly 'independent thinkers', and yet, they blindly vote marveling at Modi's face and falling for the whatsapp university bakwas...üòÄ",
        "Finally Karnataka got rid of ‚ÄúUP of south‚Äù tagline. Well done kannadigas üëèüèº",
        "Literate <> Educated.\n\nEven literate people can fall prey to misinfo. In fact it‚Äôs quite easy, just send them WhatsApp messages.\n\nCritical thinking is the key. And that‚Äôs much harder.",
        "Next state elections are coming up in Rajasthan, MP, Chattisgarh, and one of the NE states. Cong is in power in Rajasthan and Chattisgarh. BJP currently is in power in MP after Scindia took some MLAs with him. All three are important elections for both parties. The results will definitely be a harbinger for 2024.",
        "Was surprised with the high vote % for BJP. BJP certainly has a strong base. KA had several issues during the BJP term. Nothing affected this base. This is like DMK and ADMK in Tamilnadu. Both parties have a strong core base. The swing voters decide the fate and mostly lead to a complete majority.",
        "Actually, in 2019 we went to the elections after Cong won Raj, MP, and Chhattisgarh... And yet, BJP came to power with a resounding win in all these states. I don't think the state legislative assembly election results have much predictive value.\n\nMy estimation is that the 2024 election will hinge on  BJP's disinformation and divisive campaign. If people fall for their communal narratives, they will return to power.",
        "Good point. Sometimes state vs center people can have a different mindset. While there was some anti-BJP sentiment due to demonstration, GST and farmers protest -  Pulvama happened and BJP used it to their advantage. Recently we had some revelations from the then J&K Governor. Was surprised that 2019 was a resounding win better than 2014.",
        "Edit: demonetization not demonstration",
        "educated doesn't mean they can't be brainwashed or harbour more bigoted views than uneducated folks.",
        "Poor (and by some correlation uneducated) people often give parties the benefit of doubt. But really difficult to fool them twice if you don't deliver on the ground.\n\nYe \"mujhko gaali diya, Hanuman ko gaali diya, kerela mein ladki gaya Kiya\" Wala bakwas paise walo PE chal Jata hai.",
        "BJP has a footprint cos there is no legit regional party, JDS is just like congress.",
        "Infact educated can be easily persuaded with \"false reasoning\", meanwhile uneducated will not fall for any reasoning, if they see they faced a loss under this govt they will cut their losses next time.",
        "Wouldn't put it that way honestly. They lost in places that they are strong and gained in places that they are weak in. \n\nThey can reclaim their strength and would make inroads elsewhere next election. \n\nThe same 36% who voted for them last time didn't vote for them this time.",
        ">Pulvama happened\n\nIt did not just happen. It was orchestrated, or at least allowed to happen. And similar shit would recur before the next LS elections, as has on several occasions in the past ..."
