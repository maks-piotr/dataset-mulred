    "light_cleaned_comments": "Average GOA Wüóø ##Correct me if I am wrong It's pretty bad for Goa imo, goa's population is nearly 16 Lakhs and having 20-30% of child malnutrition is wild Vegetarian state, of course I think the main issue is vegetarianism. And I can guarantee you that most if not all those who are malnourished are migrants who are brought in by our politicians for votes and who cannot afford one kid but have minimum four. Goa is the only state of India where natives are way less than the migrants. Kerala always Tops Major W for kerala. Surprised that coastal odisha and capital is doing so well in child welfare compared to the rest of the state. Coastal Odisha has been the biggest beneficiary of state government priorities (The BJP government). Indian diet in general Kerala ‚ú® Meanwhile Punjab be like , hunger ? Malnourishment ? Wtf is that ? corruption Follow it India. You have to reach that level by tooth and nail. After all it is Gujarat Model. r/usernamechecksout As a Malayali all I can say is I'll continue eating my beef (for all the sanghis about to have a meltdown reading my comment, yes I will also be eating pork). Gujju gang can continue eating their sugar and carb rich diet with almost non existent protein content for the rest of their lives. Coastal region are mostly green, probably due to eating habits which include fish in diet which is good source of protein and other nutrients. haryana is a predominantly vegetarian state btw. Those critical districts in Karnataka contains a large sections of Lingayat communities who are influenced by their Lingayat seers who also wield a lot of power in Karnataka politics too. And these asshole seers have been actively protesting the inclusion of eggs in the mid-day meals. It shows that they care more about their religion more than the health of the children. Western Odisha is green too, child malnourishment depends more on factors like economic and social development. It is an undeniable fact that GoO is biased towards Eastern Odisha. Lekin bro voh masjid ke neeche mandir ? Malayali ano ? üòÖ Nice one Everyone in India cares more about religion that anything else. Shining gujjurat Hahaha. Piraud momant saar ü´° I used to think the left was logical. The obvious inference from this is mismanagement and of course religious involvement. But to think that the only reason is protein deficiency and that only meat can solve this during a 1. Climate crisis that is exacerbated by meat farming 2. Knowing full well that science has shown that one can become an athlete and live long with a full vegan diet goes to show how ignorant even the left is I realise they would rather hate on the sanghis even at cost of sounding illogical like them. Again I am not saying we should stop meat or whatever. But come on. We can‚Äôt deny we need to change our consumption ways and actually encourage anyone trying to save the world by going vegan. Honestly, even if Indians eat non vegetarian, they don't truly benefit by a big margin because most of them (in the northern side, at least) eat it only once a week or so. India is in dire need of protein awareness. we should make gujarat more red This is not about meat eaters and non meat eaters. This about people denied their rights and gov doing nothing in the sensitive issues like this. This is about saving our children. Why do you think PM eats MUSHROOMS! Does India even acknowledge the extreme over population issues instead of blaming stuff like ‚Äúvegetarian region‚Äù, ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù etc ? Does the government and people even talk about the over population issues ? Coastal areas will usually have better nutrition than the same inland areas since seafood is highly nutritious and the ocean is extremely productive. Can't they just catch a fish and label it plant based plant meat Religion trumps Protein. Mfks be eating Maida and rawa for 7 days and want everyone to stop eating eggs and meat. Vegan protein is extremely expensive if you want it to approach the quality of animal protein. Unless you‚Äôre extremely good at meal planning, you‚Äôre going to need to eat either heavily processed plant protein - which much of india doesn‚Äôt have access to - or massive amounts of carbs and calories to meet a protein requirement. I‚Äôm not saying veganism is bad, it‚Äôs objectively better for the environment and reduces suffering of animals when compared with an omnivorous diet‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs extremely restrictive. In India we have a child malnourishment problem. The climate issue is massive, but India‚Äôs per capita contribution is minuscule compared to much of the world and frankly the health of Indian children matters more than a small increase in our contribution to climate change. labours from other states Cowbelt ‚òï You may diss Kerala for it's government. But communism and INC in it early years is what made Kerala ace these parameters. ANTI NATIONAL BRO YOU ARE. JAI HIND JAI MATA DI. IN GUJARAT WE DON'T MIX WATER IN SAMBHAR NOR JUST GIVE SALT TO EAT WITH RICE. /s Hoii major credit goes to this dumbfucks digambar kamat and pramod savant Ahem! Once a week? Maybe in the north. Everyone I know eats fish on a daily basis. Maybe chicken/beef/pork twice a week. Again I agree with all you said. The transformation has to be gradual and till then children health should be projected. My beef (pun intended) was with those being proud of their meat eating because sanghis are morons. I fear the left in India is becoming what is hates just with new gods (beef, pork etc etc)‚Ä¶. The problem is this binary thinking. It's the damn religious vegetarianism that hurts the kids. This is a conspiracy by Soros. Everything is well in Ramrajya/s How does hyderabad have medium prevalence? Even in south too except Kerala. Chicken is usually eaten only once a week by most Indians since they can't afford it more than once weekly. Well both care more about nagpur Veganism or vegetarianism is a major issue for causing these problems. If atleast these people were non vegetarian some of these issues could have been resolved to some extent. And when i say being non vegetarian, i mean those people should have atleast non veg 3 or 4 days. It aint that cheap but being vegetarian and nutrient and protein sufficient is next to impossible in india being a vegetarian. They think mutton is beef and then you want to do this Yeah good luck with that approach. An athlete being a vegetarian has lots of money to get his protein and nutrients from plant sources. Even though its more bad to the environment he can sustain that stupid approch because of his wealth. Thats not the case with common people. That‚Äôs a fair perspective actually as I do see too many Indians jumping straight to the other side like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to eat all the meat, LMAO!‚Äù It‚Äôs also wrong and dumb. *BJD Government(The new Govt. is just 4-5 months old and it took years altogether for the previous govt. To achieve this) Understand something, the kids are stunted due to lack of calories. The govt has failed to create the basic supply chain to feed the kids. The govt magically supplying eggs and meat to the kids is not going to solve the problem. Sorry, I meant the BJD government Kutch in gujarat is shown as very highly malnourished whereas it has the highest per capita income (district) in gujarat . Something is off about this data. How dare you talk shit about Ameryca of India /s On Gujarat's malnutrition, one famous person once said, \"[Gujarat's malnutrition due to figure-conscious girls](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/go-figure-figure-conscious-gujarati-girls-cause-malnutrition-in-the-state-says-modi-114703-2012-08-28)\". \"Gujarat is also a middle-class state. The middle-class is more beauty conscious than health conscious.\" \"If a mother tells her daughter to have milk, they'll have a fight. She'll tell her mother, \"I won't drink milk. I'll get fat.\" Keep coping. Malnourishment and Stunting seems to be major concern for North and Western India.üáÆüá≥ Gujarat's got problems. But I'm pretty sure its not as simple as \"eat more meat bro\" that most of the idiots here seem to think is the problem. I'm so glad I grew up eating sea food and red meat on the regular. Kerala W with our fish loving population. üòé Delulu is the solulu The amount of blind dislikes without arguing in the validity of my comment shows how sensitive the left has become of its stances that it is scared of challenging itself. at this point India‚Äôs left is as religious as the right. Religious about atheism religious about meat religious about anything against the right. P It's like the more malnourished these seers are the more stupid decisions they make. Yeah who would've thought right? ü§° Literally going to hamper brain development and growth. But if living in misery was an Olympic level sport then these losers would top it. Children are very fussy eaters and sometimes you cannot force just a narrow diet onto them. My own daughter went through periods of only eating fish, chicken, beef, eggs etc when she was young and didn't want to eat anything else. And children will often just eat unhealthily if they cannot get the food they need - the result is they will be both physically and mentally stunted. Let them choose to become vegetarians after they turn 18 years old if it is important to them and it can be their own decision. \"on par with states like bihar and jharkand\"üíÄ Science has shown you can become an athlete with just a vegan diet but have you found a cost effective way to source everything? If it was already perfect then why are some of the most malnourished people also from vegetarian states (not even vegan). This whole \"leftist\" argument being used everywhere by the sangh shows how blind and delusional you and the rest of the sangh are. Anything that remotely targets Gujjus? Yeah that must be leftist propaganda ü§° The left is alright with your life choices. Eat what you want and worship whom you want. Can't say the same thing about the right wing. I think many people are taking more issue with your generalizing about the left being sensitive and illogical than your issues on meat vs veg. am not even kidding , it is UP BIHAR in disguise , all sikhs going to canada and we are left with laborers All the coastal areas are green. That's awesome tbh. Rather a protein deficient stats. In response to a thread that is generalising a whole problem as saying it is a problem because of meat. And do we really want to pull that thread on generalisation when we ourselves engage in name calling like sanghis that are also generalising. All I am saying is the comments section reminded me of a worrying trend in India just like this malnutrition post reminded others or sanghis thing is where non veg is not tabboo or made at home every day this is not an issue. mf‚Äôs will save to get a bunglow and won‚Äôt invest in food How is malnourishment measured? GJ - America without guns and drugs R/RepostSleuthBot r/RepostSleuthBot u/RepostSleuthBot ofc we prolly have the least healthy diet yeah this survey is 10 years old and Kutch and north Gujarat in general has majorly improved in last 10 years, before that conditions were unliveable there, but don't speak logic here just say Gujarat bad Natil evedeya Punjab is mostly vegetarian and yet green. Is it really vegetarianism and religion that you need to attack here ? The real reason is welfare as OP rightly pointed out. The map is inline with income inequality. National average for vegetarianism is 29%. UP itself is 47% vegetarian. People forcing others to eat meat are as worse as the people forcing them to not eat meat. West Bengalil ninnanu... I learnt malayalam because I like this language. I'm originally half Bengali- half Odia > I'm so glad I grew up eating sea food I wish I did. I can't handle most fish except for canned Tuna and haddock. The smell and taste just get to me. Even with shellfish, unless it's farm grown, it's difficult. I've tried over the years to force myself to get get used to the taste but it's never worked unless the fish is super processed. My SO loves most fish but we get restricted at home because of me. i see this in my own house yr. My parents are so brainwashed about being vegetarian ( we used to be non vegetarian 10 years ago ). Their health has just gone downhill since then. All they eat is high carb diet and they wonder why they have uncontrolled diabetes. What's worse is that they wine about me eating nonveg. According to them I'm being unhealthy and hedonistic. üóø I'd say it's an acquired taste and something you'll have to keep having until it becomes alright. Kinda like beer. please get some real food in your belly, you are not making sense Try salmon or else mahi mahi (hard to find but see if frozen food suppliers have like cambay tiger) It's changing Just eat Meat üçñ or Fish üêü or Egg ü•ö and it will solve all the problems of Malnutrition & other health issues. Just Humans are the foremost APEX PREDATOR that earth has ever produced & Homo sapiens Ancestors won the world from dangerous PREDATORS in pre historic time with barely any tools. And now their descendants in india specifically, are fighting on what should be eaten or not & who are higher on society by their birthing parents. Such wretched wokeism entered india thousands years back, that it consequences are still felt to this day. üò¢ I am CURIOUS why people in UP and Bihar asks for these things, they perform really bad compared to other states across different categories I've had Salmon. Alaskan fresh I can eat(As in I helped catch it). Canned and Atlantic not so much. it becomes too \"fishy\". Yup then try the mahi mahi. It‚Äôs not fishy at all. It‚Äôs a bit harder to find but it is definitely a good option for people who don‚Äôt like the fishy taste (myself included). Try searching a recipe for panko and macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and thank me later :) Funny you should mention beer. THAT I did have here and there growing up when an uncle or father's friend would pass me a sip. My SO also says to keep trying to eat it. And I have over the years but it didn't take. I have been lushing orotein to family. Its a lain to even get their protein content to 20 gms. Vegetarianism is a clear red-herring here. Punjab is one of the most vegetarian states, despite that it has low malnutrition. The issue at heart is income inequality, solve that and you fix many issues: malnutrition, stunted development, anemia in women, diabetes etc. Yes, it may be by creating a more meat-eating culture, but we all know that is an uphill battle that is ultimately not even worth fighting. It's honestly much more efficient to subsidies healthier foods and tax the unhealthy (but I doubt that can happen in gujarat) There is also a major opportunity here: lab grown meat will do great business in these states. It will be much easier to get around the moral objections with lab grown meat as well. Once a meat-eating culture is created, a meat-producing culture is also created, ie farmers\" livelihoods get tied with people eating meat. This is the sole reason why lab grown meat isn't being produced in the west (in fact, it's getting banned). Farmer lobbies are powerful and worth a lot of votes, so it's best to introduce lab grown meat before there is a meat-eating culture. üòç ‡¶Ø‡ßá ‡¶ö‡¶Æ‡ßé‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ Gujrat ü§° Biharü§° Jhat koi nahi janta h ü§° Veg is costly in gujarat itself.. Really struggled to find any good non veg restaurants in ahmedabad outer circle. Literally Rikshavala type hygienic non veg food s available here. ü§ê Being from the south, that was literally very very hard to put up with ‡¥®‡µÅ‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥ü ‡¥´‡µÅ‡¥°‡µç‚Äå.. Overlay with vegetarianism may give us a good link for the malnutrition, there was other data showing protein deficiency in the Indian diet in general. I guess the linked data is the effects of malnutrition like stunted growth. Is there anything with the cause? I agree to your points. One thing that i am trying to point is humans have always been more meat eating than veg eating. Eatable veggies were very rare in the past and humans mostly relied on hunting for food. We modified the veggies and fruits for what they are today. We invented agriculture to reduce the effort of hunting and veggies are even hard to digest. So it is very natural for humans to eat meat than having veg. We are omnivores. This is what the culture here is trying to prevent. Its trying to throw away something that is very natural to us and most have fallen for it. And these same people who rant about meat eating breeds animals for eggs and dairy products. I have zero respect for the people who fights for vegetarianism and actively consume dairy products and eggs. Vegans are a different breed altogether. In India it is measured by tracking the ratios of carbohydrates, proteins and fats in a sample population's diet. It is a recent initiative to start tracking this 2023 I think. This data shows a bad picture, but we need this data to do anything about the problem. Punjab and Haryana will have lot of dairy in their diet. Being vegetarian is not necessarily bad if you are balancing your diet with other sources with same nutrition. Thier diet may be developed because of what is easily available and practical, other reasons like religion for deciding diet with blind faith deserves to be attacked. Red area ü´• Lmao I see. Can you point me to a source of this information? Doesn't sound right to me. How can that macro ratio be useful in concluding anything? Nutrition means micronutrients, right? Iron, vitamins ,Zinc etc . Tracking macros nutrients doesn't make any sense. Each of the macros could be anywhere on the nutrient dense to nutrient empty scale, depending on the source I am a Hindu and vegetarian, but I have recently embraced eggs. They are a cheap source of protein. Eggs should be made compulsory in schools. I understand a lot of people have their personal religious views, but for growing children, we need to make eggs compulsory. A grown man can then take a sane decision if they want to be a non vegetarian or not. And hamburgers Agreed Considering everyone hates on Kerala and it‚Äôs communism, at least in this aspect, socialism is working. see again Punjab? Did you translate it üòÇ ? ‡¶Ø‡ßá doesn't make sense here it'll be ‡¶ï‡¶ø ‡¶ö‡¶Æ‡ßé‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ Google translate bro Nutrition covers all the things. First whether you get enough calories, then if you get a good balance of macros and finally whether you get enough fresh vegetables and fruits. It's difficult to get enough calories when you skip calorie-dense foods like eggs. The amount of people blaming vegetarian diet while blatantly ignoring Punjab and even Haryana is appalling. Instead of advocating for non veg inclusion, which is extremely tougher, the red states can try adopting more veg protein options like Punjab. Atleast spell ‚Äúlabourers‚Äù right if you‚Äôre gonna be a prick who tf cares on this shit posting platform. I aint giving any exam. You are not gonna deduct any marks lil bro What is up with Northern Karnataka? I know they are drought hit districts but have they always been neglected? More like common Kerala W. A major W would be if it increased its jobs . As a Keralite, we need to find ways to increase job opportunities Manga karyam parayumbo thenga karyam parayunnoda? Or maybe facts hurt and they do not align with your political view. So why not implement it throughout the country ? Why is it necessary to choose a road where religious people are hurt, when the other route is equally viable ? I am an atheist myself, but I don't wake up with the thought of hating religious people every morning. I understand some practices are objectively wrong. But vegetarianism / veganism, even if it is due to religion is great. If people do good, I don't think anyone else should care, whether it is for charity, profit or religion. Like someone pointed out, if you don‚Äôt control carbs and sugar, protein diet is not going to save you from diabetes. And Keralites are notorious for their love of tapioca. Absolutely terrible that we have such technology and services available, and so many religious people who donate millions to religion institutes, and none of that solves the hunger of a poor unfortunate kid who had the misfortune of being born in a big situation. Haryana? Haryana? Ehmmm Why keep having children then? Also beef is nutritious ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Nobody listened when we said beef is nutritious ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think its rice though.

I have zero respect for the people who fights for vegetarianism and actively consume dairy products and eggs. Vegans are a different breed altogether. Yeah dairy products have moral issues as well but one step at a time. > One thing that i am trying to point is humans have always been more meat eating than veg eating. Eatable veggies were very rare in the past and humans mostly relied on hunting for food. We modified the veggies and fruits for what they are today. Yeah, this [article ](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/evolution-of-diet/) is a good read and agrees with what you're saying. However, humans have been on an agricultural diet for over 10k years, we have eaten a lot more veggies in this time than when we were mainly hunter-gatherers, so this has been plenty time to adapt. It's not like before 5 years ago everyone was a pure meat eater and now they're thrusting vegetarianism on everyone. Both meat and veggies have been modified for what they are today. > This is what the culture here is trying to prevent. Its trying to throw away something that is very natural to us and most have fallen for it. This culture empathises with the sufferings of animals. That is good. Currently it usually does mean a nonnutritious diet, but the answer isn't to kill animals when lab grown meat is an available technology. In the rest of the world, startups are currently aiming to create lab-grown meat that tastes and feels like meat. In India, you want the opposite, you want the lab-grown meat to look, feel and taste as different as real meat if you want to sell it to the vegetarian masses, this is why India is a really unique opportunity in this sector and practically no competition exists here either. It's not malnutrition. It's dieting. They're trying to make Gujrat supermodels. Yet we have highest life expectancy That‚Äôs due to high carb diet dude. Yet somehow managed to have higher life expectancy maybe that same because of the health sector but still most of the households here have at least 1 diabetes patients but they‚Äôre still live their fullest less bothered Because eggs are easier to transport, cook, store and are cheaper than diary, if we compare how much protein our body gets from them. It's a very \"easy\" source of nutrition that religious fanatics are so aggressively against because their priority is far from the wellbeing of the community. How is malnourishment defined here ? eating sea food from child hood is the key after 20s u cannot start liking sea food cheers to my parents for forcing me to eat seafood at childhood Being vegetarian is not at all unhealthy. Matter of fact, most Indians are not vegetarians or non vegetarians. They are 'carbitarians'. Ever seen Indians eating raw vegetables and fruits on a daily basis with zero masala and salt? It's our eating habits. Kerala is a non vegetarian state and people are comparatively healthy and yet they also have the highest diabetes/blood sugar patients with respect to population. Lol! They think vegetarianism is equal to rice and chapati. No Indian is truly vegetarian or non vegetarian. We hardly include vegetables and fruits in our diet. Our food is full of masala and oil, be it vegetarian or non vegetarian. We are carbitarians at best. :p \\*in diabetes. Red meat on the regular sounds like a nightmare for my stomachü•≤ It's not about veg/non veg tbh. It's about how we cook. Be it vegetarian/non vegetarian, all our food is full of oil and spices. Moreover, we hardly include raw vegetables and fruits in our diet. That is why South being a 'W' in this aspect takes a major 'L' when it comes to diabetes and heart diseases compared to the North. Precisely why Punjab ranks above so many non veg dominant states. Shut up, gujarat is model state ü•∞ And precisely why all South Indian states suffer from diabetes and heart diseases. Supercool Indian spotted. Let's assume eggs are the end all be all solution for nutrition in India. ( Even though lentils are cheaper per gram of protein, protein powder has better absorption, and protein itself is not complete nutrition, fibers etc matter too and India's data for malnourished has children with literally no food at all ) My question is, why insist on forcing religious people to consume eggs ? If nutrition is the priority why not protein and vitamin supplements which everyone is fine with ? Why not choose the path of least resistance? Why *insist* on eggs ? Seems more of a political statement to me than a genuine concern for unhealthy religious people. I would just like to mention that the map shown in the first image takes reference from NFHS-4 report which was conducted in 2015-2016, since then a new survey has been conducted in 2019-2021 called NFHS-5. Between the two reports average stunting in children went from an average of 38.4% to 35.5%. Here's the latest report as of 2024: [NFHS-5](https://mohfw.gov.in/sites/default/files/NFHS-5_Phase-II_0.pdf) The overlap with Hindutva is amazing. ... and tasty. It also clears the roads. > eat it only once a week or so I am vegetarian about once a month Whose mushroom? No one is forcing religious people to eat eggs. But why should the majority be forced to refrain from healthy nutritious foods if a few people don't want to eat it? Speak for yourself Think it's something you get accustomed to. But yeah everything has to be balanced Yeah some of them are blue also Confused noises Wdym bro you should get your eyes checked for color blindness. there is no blue anywhere.

So oru vazhi nokkiyal nammuk tenga ind but no one wants it We just got high standards >Even though lentils are cheaper per gram of protein, protein powder has better absorption, This is objectively incorrect LMFAO. Protein powder is significantly more expensive. >and protein itself is not complete nutrition, fibers etc matter too and India's data for malnourished has children with literally no food at all I never said eggs compensates for fiber/vitamin/mineral consumption. Indians are severely oriented deficient and that's something that needs to be addressed. >National Family Health Survey (NFHS) Data: The revelation from the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015‚Äì16) paints a stark picture of protein inadequacy in India. Remarkably, this data exposes that an astonishing 73% of Indian households fall short of attaining the recommended daily intake of proteins Since you cannot Google. >Why *insist* on eggs ? You expecting someone who cannot afford a daily meal to have protein supplement has to be the most out of touch bullshit I've read all day. 1 egg costs 6rs You need 3 eggs to fulfill your daily protein intake Tell me how much it would cost per serving of your precious protein powders and you might just crack this puzzle in the process. Oh and you'd need about 90gm-100gm of UNCOOKED dal to match that. 100gm dal costs 30rs so even if we are ready to eat multiple bowls of dal, we aren't matching how value for money egg is. I hope this post comes in r/gujarat . But it wont. I have seen them only talk about the good stuff and picking up bad comments about their state and talking about it. Don't need for beef ,chicken is enough , most Hindus even in Tamil nadu don't eat beef How is new government working ? So we can include pork in school lunch ? In MDM they give you just one food item. I mean that's it. Not a whole meal. In most cases you definitely don't have an option. Been through that. The scheme is that bad and yet so successful. Should be a reality check for people on how poor the Indian lower class is that they're desperate for that. I hate that most people here are not aware how easy it is to access ration in Southern states which massively helps this map. In Maharashtra for example you have to present 25 documents and 7 bribes to access this privilege. That said, I am alright with it being presented as an *option*, but I don't understand the hate for not eating eggs/being vegetarian and presenting eggs as the sole nutritious option. You also could include supplemented salads or mixed Dal chawal with tofu in MDM which would actually be nutritious, offer fruits etc but even that never sees the light of day. Would be equally nutritious if not more. Most importantly this is a solution both sides agree to ! Not to mention plant based food will always be more cheaper compared to eggs in a resource strapped country. That's just basic thermodynamics. Fighting for eggs feels like solving a problem that does not exist. You need more nutritious food? Need funding. If you have the funds, eggs no eggs does not really matter. Oh so now we are judging on what we eat. Huh. What do you mean by \"even in TN\"? Most left leaning state in india. Most tamilian are trained to believe they are not Hindus Sure Nah. The majority of my family are vegetarians themselves. I don't judge them. The reason I judge people in this region is because of how much of a fuzz they create over something as simple as meat consumption. You'd rarely ever find lunatics like that down South. What? Where did that come fromüòÖ. Who said anything about any political party. Do you think only leftists eat beef l? Do you think BJPians in Kerala dont eat beef? Whaat? I have tamil friends and Im hearing this for the first time. Are you a tamilian yourself? Yes I'm Tamil , it very common in social media slowly creeping into cinemas , your religion (North Indian ) is different ,your Ariyan I'm Dravidian divide is very politicislzed by Dravidian organizations. They even use ‡Æï‡ØÄ‡Æ¥‡Æü‡Æø as proof Hinduism is imported into Tamil Nadu. But ‡Æï‡ØÄ‡Æ¥‡Æü‡Æø is industrial site most religious vestegious would be found sarounding in cities or living areas Hindu is keyword here ,most conservative Muslims I have seen are in kerala.Kerala's enlightenment didn't reach its minorities. But have seen ex Muslims growing have talked to some in clubhouse. Every where you see in india ,its Hindus are progressive like these in varying percentage. But Muslims didn't get touched by these progressive ideas . It always was. Gujarat model is artificial fuckery. It will stir controversy, left leaning parties would argue it will deter Muslims parents sending their children to school like hijab. I know you or people in sub is not against it So does punjab ngl RARE BUT NONETHELESS WELCOME ANDHRA PRADESH W >This is objectively incorrect LMFAO. Protein powder is significantly more expensive. I said lentils are cheaper you can't read ? LMFAO. You must not even realise how heavily eggs are subsidised do you ? >protein powder has better absorption Anyways I typed a long reply explaining stuff, but then I realised you literally cannot read or comprehend what I have written above or check your sources written by some shady guy who is remotely not a dietician. There are so many googleable factual errors in your answer, the irony lol. [https://medium.com/@Naveen23/unveiling-the-protein-deficiency-challenge-in-india-a-closer-look-at-alarming-statistics-b40da5a16cce](https://medium.com/@Naveen23/unveiling-the-protein-deficiency-challenge-in-india-a-closer-look-at-alarming-statistics-b40da5a16cce) Nowhere did I mention eggs to not be an option did I ? But you couldn't stick to the point. So there's that. >You expecting someone who cannot afford a daily meal to have protein supplement has to be the most out of touch bullshit I've read all day. Expecting a person to stay full for an entire day on eggs probably is the most out of touch bullshit I've read all year. Guess you have a lot of eggs inside your head you need to clear. India is not a vegetarian country. That was my point. Nor* those highlighted states are vegetarian >Expecting a person to stay full for an entire day on eggs Oh your dumbassery assumed I suggested surviving on 3 eggs for an entire day. As opposed to what, surviving a whole day on 100gm of dal? I can't figure out how you drew that conclusion out. My bad, I thought you had a functioning brain. >Nowhere did I mention eggs to not be an option did I ? You specifically asked why I insisted on eggs. I don't understand how you managed to confuse yourself with something you said. So there's that. >You must not even realise how heavily eggs are subsidised do you ? Okay? People still get it at cheaper rates? What kind of braindead take is this LMFAO >There are so many googleable factual errors in your answer, the irony lol. Literally every single information I typed out was after googling the details up but you would know fuckall about that haha Surprised about Punjab and Haryana India has a very poor perspective on what a good diet means. No matter vegetarian or non-vegetarian, the average Indian diet is loaded with carbs, fats and sugar. Coupled with laziness and zero attention to physical health, malnutrition is very common. High carb diet and lack of exercise. It has nothing to do with eating meat lol. First, you need to have something to eat inorder to be diabetic amiryt Why do you think so? Does non-veg diet lead to those problems? Thats what, if you dont want to eat meat. Then dont, stop shaming or boycotting the family over meat consumption we are omnivores not herbivores What the hell is a carbitarian? Our pesticide laden veggies and fruits shouldn't be eaten raw in the first place. And contrary to general consensus, cooking generally improves nutritional availability in foods. Diabetes in Kerala is due to high carb diet, especially eating a lot of rice daily, if anything they should reduce carbs and should be eating more meat and veggies. Lmao, who said to you nutrition means just micro nutrients? That's secondary to macros anyday You do know that the highlighted states have higher vegetarian population than the average state and not every child is malnourished hence it will be comparable to the vegetarian population with lower income Then please explain. Why is most of the cowbelt so malnourished? Better to be diabetic than being malnourished, amiryt. Also we have highest life expectancy, lol. Shouldn't you be worrying more about the malnourished kids in your region? A single sheet of paper can't decide the condition of my nation! This anti beef retardation is one of the stupidest ideas which makes Indians a laughing stock. ‚ÄúCow piss drinkers‚Äù is what we are called and the saddest part is that it‚Äôs not untrue. Chetta, oru plate beef fry Ulli Sura would like to have a word When will we be like CHAD KERALA? üî•üêêüö© Rampant poverty and administrative malpractice probably play big roles. Just a hunch, but probably an accurate hunch. Punjab has more vegetarians per rata than most other Indian states and it seems to be doing fine in the graph. Meanwhile, less than 10% of the people in Bihar are vegetarians, but that state is still red af. The problem with Job creation is that it needs land and mineral resources for being able to create IT/ Manufacturing hubs. Kerala is extremely densely populated with natural and agricultural resources which cannot be got rid of to make mines , Hubs or any sort of mega infrastructure project for ecological reasons . I really don‚Äôt think killing crops and deforestation is what we even need as a country with all this global warming shit üòÄ. I rather a nation of gulfies with remittance economy than starved , polluted and broken down lands. And the point of being a country is that we allot infrastructure projects according to the land layout and resources available. But central govt consistently failed to do that and this is why state govts are doing the heavy work in this regard. Other South Indian states with more mineral resources, barren non agricultural lands and what not have actually managed to do this not to mention infrastructure projects connecting the places within states well. More importantly at least a highly aware and educated/skilled population means a lot more easiness to migrate meaning more remittances can be made. I am very sorry, I was confusing a non government research paper with the NFHS survey and MPI report. The MPI report does not consider anything other than BMI and weight. [National MPI report 2021](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-11/National_MPI_India-11242021.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj5xeTT2Y2KAxXonq8BHQQBHK4QFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw15-Stkm-rBLsriBsWAcH8U) On Page 16, the Nutrition Indicator is explained.

I think job opportunities in Kerala is relatively less because there are way less IT/ Industrial hubs in proportional to the educated population ( which tbh is too many ) or even regular population. Almost all states with good jobs almost always have a bustling metro / capital with huge IT / finance hubs and some core industrial/ manufacturing towns ( TN, Karnataka and Maharashtra as examples ) . This does need geographical resources to make it happen also In Kerala and TN they eat more than once a week actually. Beef access does make eating meat a lot more cheaper actually Surprise Surprise, Dhokla has no nutritional value Fish Lovin, Beef Lovin, Pork Lovin, Mutton Lovin, and most importantly nutrition lovin! Beef really isn't. If we go by that, why Punjab has lower malnutrition than Kerala? They don't eat beef at all Are you color blind by any chance? No I am not. It just shows only 4-5 districts of Kerala having low malnutrition while one district has more than 30%. Punjab has from 20-30% as a whole here with ig one district having lower than 20%. So every Punjab indeed has better here Ah so you are just bad at geography and maybe statistics Well, I agree with most of your points . But \"depending on remittances \" is not gonna work anymore as people are migrating more to western countries than gulf which allows getting a PR and staying there , thus people building/buying houses there instead of sending money to build in kerala. Kerala is gonna have a bad bad time in the future. We need to seriously increase our IT, electronic , Pharma and other companies which requires lower land. IT has to be decentralised as we can't afford to have a city like Bangalore with roads so small and land already densely packed I meant, there is no need to bash on kerala on a post that the state clearly performs good. This post is not even about kerala. No one said kerala is perfect, but appreciate the good things thats happening too. This is like scolding the kid who just won a race, because he lost an exam last month. Valid. And it's not like our economy is in dire condition as well, we have like the 6th largest GDP per capita. It's only our youth wanting even better life And what is your claim on that? None of the yellow is part of Kerala and even if it had one yellow, it doesn't put Punjab above it. Actually, half of the portion of yellow is in Kerala. From where the Kerala-Tamil Nadu dam passes through. And yes it does put Punjab above because even if we ignore this data, Punjabis lives more than an avg Malayalee Lmao Your region also tops in literacy. Sad that you got left behind. Huh? Carbitarian is fancy term invented by me. :p Also, what I wanted say is that we hardly include salads and fruits in our diet. A population surviving on carbs, carbs and only carbs shouldn't call itself vegetarian. Sorry brother no offense. And my \"beef\" comment was supposed to be a joke. Sorry if it wasn't a good one. I didn't even got offended but ok Did they ask for this? They do, Might be biased, but I have seen many people saying, They don't need hospital, school etc, issues like inflatration, religion are bigger thing for them. Kabka census h? Nai pata hota toh muh band karke bhaita karo Nai pata hota toh muh band karke bhaita karo Jey chomotkar? ü§£ google translate zindabad I liked that. Labourers and not laborers. Brit spelling is a rarity these days. Magic mushrooms? Really? It's fine, at least they tried Cow Belt is called Cow Belt for a reason!"
