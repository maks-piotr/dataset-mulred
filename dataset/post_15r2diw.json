Its a nightmare to develop the old regions of the city, so the government is planning a massive extension of its metro to its outskirts and adjoining regions without completing the connectivity in the city. These regions are already well connected by 4 lane roads, however, the government is going for an overkill simply to shift the growing population to its outskirts.

        "\"Breaking down existing all together and start with a clean slate...\" \n\nThat's where the problem lies.\nIt has never worked in any part of the world and it will never work.\n\nThere is a famous urban design theory by Scottish biologist Patrick Geddas, called \"selective surgery\".\n\nWhen you have certain part of the hand infected, you don't just grab the whole arm and remove it from torso, you try to identify the problem and try to resolve with such an intervention that there is a minimum effect on whatever is functioning correctly.\n\nSimilarly we don't have to create a whole clean slate, we identify the problems and try to resolve while still Maintaining the basic idea of our city's urban fabric.\n\nGovernment does not see Slum redevelopment with an approach of selective surgery. Or with any approach at all to be honest.\nInstead they bulldoze the whole goddamn area and make 20 storey so called \"affordable housing\" as a mean to resettle the slum somewhere outskirts of the city and the precious land of the slum which is in heart of the city goes to builder lobby for their next flashy luxurious schemes.\n\nThe multi storey housing which government provides is not at all appropriate for the life of the people of the slum.\nA multi storey building meaning you have to provide facilities like elevators which are so costly that the people from that background will never be able to sustain such facilities, in the end these people move out of those indira awas yojana because there are no jobs for them nearby where they live in walking distance, the cost of maintenance is too high for them to live and they live such a lifestyle where their connection with ground is very important and living on 12th floor is never going to be appropriate for them. And now they move back to informal squatter where they can find and we are back to square one with slums generating somewhere else. So it's a vicious cycle that keeps on repeating. And we blame it on the poor and immigrants for this issue.\n\nThere are many good examples done by various architects and urban planners to find various ways to tackle this.\nSearch and read about Aranya low cost housing project in indore by Ar B V Doshi, or Belapur housing in Mumbai by Ar Charles Correa.\n\nI don't need to be CM or PM, I just need the government to listen to institute which is raising voices for these issues, listen to urban planners, designers and architects.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "How can we make Indian cities beautiful?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Undoubtedly India is growing, disposable income is on the rise, so are aspirations ! However, Indian cities are quite ugly ! Badly planned, buildings - structures jutting out, buildings with random colours, pollution, lack of planned neighborhoods, few green/open spaces .. I need not say more: we all live in India.. Unfortunately this is never an election issue.. Breaking down existing layouts, redesigning them and reconstruction will cost a bomb and would be next to impossible.. Let's say, hypothetically, if you were the PM / CM of the country/state.. how would you tackle this problem?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "By bringing Back the British Raj Lol. cruel, not desirable by any measure... but unfortunately true: they did build beautiful structures ! Infact : as a civilization we have made substantial progress in most aspects of life but seem to have regressed when it comes to architecture ! Once people start respecting the place they live in rather than only caring for their village which offers them nothing. I'm not kidding Man,I don't really care about beauty.I just want the cities to be clean and for there to be no flooding when it rains.. Where will you get your maids, rickshawallas, dhobis, auto drivers , street vendors if you want to make ' Beautiful ' . The beauty of our cities are these small important and colourful lives most of us would even stop to appreciate. Stop Spitting First. 1. Actual Urban planning - expanding the city limits, govt designing the colonies 2. Recycling centers or Waste-to-energy plants in every city or town 3. Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities also catching up to reduce the load on Tier 1 cities 4. Per capita income increasing There is a theory which says that cities in west only became better when their population stabilised or started declining. Till 1970s, their cities were also congested and disgusting. New York and London had huge slums. Paris was dirty and filled with crime. It was only after their overall population stabilised that their cities became better. Invest more on public infrastructure and maintenance (maintenance doesn't only mean collecting fee for roads we use, basically cleanliness staves, pay them more, employ them more) nuke the poor fix overpopulation first Sarcasm well received :) but there's no beauty or glory in disease breeding shitholes unfit for ocrs let alone humans.. the most hardworking people in our society who make our world tick deserve much better If you wish i can bestow you with a your end, so you can live in your fantasy forever and ever Interesting.. some Google material .. Thanks To start with , Adhani has taken over Dharavi, is now building a 3 bedroom 1500sqft house for each resident and will be relocated!!! This Ouch ! Make a movie with a megastar with chow-chow dialogues, remake of a 90s song, inevitable love story, wildly unrealistic circumstances, and clear messaging. Obviously that has fixed our problems in the past Medium type housing (using mass produced structures, like after ww2 in eastern europe) over mauhala/ghetto will be effective but a little cruel( since people living there will have to be displaced for a while), on the plus side you can give the housing back to the person with some appropriate concessions and/or conditions. Not only you will now house more people( looking at how mauhala/ghetto works may be as much as before) but you shall do it, more lavishly. Tldr: Raze ghetto and follow soviet style restructuring after the ww2. 🤣 None of your pictures reflect that 'disposable income' demographic. India is, generally speaking, a poor country. Till we don't make their lives better, lift them out of poverty, they will continue to exist in these challenging conditions & cities will struggle to reflect that 'beautiful' face value. What happens to that land (Dharavi) after residents are relocated? city planning, infrastructure design, and planning, really just need extensive planning on all levels. Adhani will create the billionaires paradise!! Malls, residential areas, private air strips, hotels, many things on his list I guess. Not littering on the streets for a start By supporting modi and adani Just give proper wages and tools to Cleaners and other Municipal corporation workers. 2 words - Waste Management So, just like the typical plots of B grade bollywood movies of the 80's - kick out the poor & grab the land? Ok. Hmm lots of google'able material.. thanks Birth control. Literally just this. Encourage the usage of contraceptives and not have a dozen kids. They're going to end up living in pathetic conditions like this. Scumbag capitalists will talk about population collapse and all that crap. To them I say why don't you try living in one of the most populated cities in the world as an average person and tell us you can do that for the rest of your life. What Adani has promised to do with Dharavi is nothing short of magic. Adani says he intends to not only transform Mumbai's Dharavi into a modern city centre but also preserve and promote the local micro enterprises and small industries. Rehabilitation of livelihoods could involve a combination of training centres focused on upskilling, common facility centres for product-based and service-based entrepreneurship models, R&D centres, data centres and MSME helpdesks, among other things. The project could also look at the creation of organised and systemic marketplaces in line with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). All that is in addition to amenities like gas, water, electricity, sanitation and drainage, healthcare and recreational facilities, and open spaces, as well as a world-class hospital and a school. That sounds nearly impossible if you look at the number of people involved and the sheer complexity of rehabilitating numerous small industries such as leather, textiles and pottery. But Adani, who manages airports, ports and mines, is known for his project management skills. His group is already building an airport in Mumbai not very far from Dharavi as well as several real estate projects. Start by having planning permission with proper infrastructure. Population is not a problem. Thats the lie they have been telling you for ages. Contrary, population is leading the growth. If popular was problem, china wouldn't have grown. Change Indian culture. Indian culture promotes littering and trash as not being your problem. That's why every Indian city I have visited is overflowing with trash. You need to change this thinking at home. True in fact the world will experience population bust in coming years First pleae stop the \"If China can do X, India is supposed to be able too....\" trope. The reality is the REVERSE as in \"If China can X, India can't...if India can Y, China can't...\" Back to why I say \"overpopulation\" - it is because it is so real & serious in India that it will dfefeat any ambitions & destroy any beauty. Basically it will just overrun & fuck up any infra. The reality is the REVERSE as in \"If China can X, India can't...if India can Y, China can't...\" Do you have any evidence to support this? Or are you just saying it because u feel like saying it??? No. Overpopulation does not destroy any infra. Look at Tokyo. Again, I am talking with evidence. The government needs to create better policies with land allotment and zoning. Roads needs to be fixed along with sewer pipelines. Every house should have a fresh water pipe, drainage pipe, and electricity. Sewage should be treated. Hey, guess what! If I am allowed, I would like to take 500 million poor people from India & spread them around the world. Once they are gone, I will happily transform their lands, fields, jugghis, etc etc to resorts, flashy malls, high-end education institutions, bike lanes, boulevards, fancy corporate offices & museums/art galleries .. All that, only if I am allowed to displace 500 million poor people, who are already living sub human, rotten lives, so let us out them out of their misery. Right?? Not. Adani will make money from poor peoples blood as long as it's his name & his bank balance that sees the benefit. thing about every city in India is no matter how beautifully you plan new colonies/settlements there will always be old areas which look like shit. old unplanned mediaeval settlements are a feature of every city in India and are difficult to manage and improve.. > Look at Tokyo You might as well say look at planet Somaris.... IMO building new cities would be easier. Sigma male will just bulldoze their ghettos and tell them to just buy a house 🗿 That's again a childish reply.. Tokyo is on Earth. It's a 10-hour flight from India. Reduce population Think of the population density in India, think about how much trash one person can generate, and think of the infrastructure needed to manage and haul that trash and take it somewhere where you can’t see it and deal with it. It’s not just a culture problem, it’s population, it’s lack of enough sanitation resources and infrastructure. WW3 But India is in a different century Yes. But we know what policies worked there. They will work here, too. We have better land then them. No problems with earthquake or Tsunamis. India knows how to setup 1. Pipelines 2. Sewage treatment plants 3. Provide electricity 4. Has Labor to do work. The will of the administration is missing because people are uneducated and do not ask for development. Instead, ask for free electricity and water. If citizens ask for better facilities, then it's no big deal. It is about 1 year project maximum. Bulldozem and start mining whatever is in the earth there, then invest profits into the capital of India. > will work here, too No, no and no - not never but LONG time. Bulldoze the ugly parts. Simple. Ngl. The first pic looks like jerusalem true my ass. it's a problem FOR INDIA for a long time to come. Collect all the Infinity Rings and snap your fingers. The maximum population for India this century is 1600 million we are at 1400 now, that's a rise of 14% over the next 77 yrs 💀, that's what happens when you fail statistics. as in managing a freaking tsunami > we are at 1400 now if you want to believe this ancient stat, fine. Who do you think makes these stats? Govt? yes the incedibly incompetent GoI Sorry to break your heart but the data is from the UN i.e. a Guesstimate. how/what do you think they based their guesstimate on ? do you actually think \"UN\" actually did the survey ? You know India is not even freaking Mexico right ? What? 💀 I get your point, but I really request you to watch the Tamil movie Kaala if possible. It will address your question and might even make you think about what does it mean to beautify a city. what what ? you can't read Sanskrit ? One of pet peeve is road and side walks. Side walks can be extended as a general case and road needs to get to the edge of sidewalk. This completely eliminate any mud patch between road and sidewalk. Second, road is public space. If government can make money by renting the space for parking, that money can be invested in improvements to the infrastructure. In Mumbai smart folks are renting public land for parking and making money 🤑 for free (just need that entrepreneur drive) Photoshop The answer lies in population control. We are already past saturation point where we cannot sustain more than a billion people. We are crippled with resources so with whatever good we are having, middle class guys like us or rich people are living a relatively comfortable life. Saying this shit on our Independence day, you need a good ass kicking again. Come this time fella, we'll win a war against your minion army. If the municipality just starts keeping the streets clean and people also stop throwing the trash so openly, I think more than half of the problem will be solved. Next for all the stray animals appropriate shelters should be made available and they shouldn't roam around in the streets freely. In the final phase the government should convert the slum areas into pakka houses or apartments. Rest Indian cities are pretty beautiful with their own unique culture and architecture. Just a bit of changes on the part of people can greatly enhance their outlook. Create more double story homes with different colors The problem is people. A waste management company with a fleet of trucks Every single streets, Mass clean ups So Paris hasn't changed one bit Don’t adopt bourgeoisie environmentalism and follow equitable planning led by planning authorities. Open more planning schools and planning jobs across the country. There is a huge supply demand gap wrt to professional planners. Do that then let’s talk about the implementation issues. Just get Modi to visit the city. Beautification will happen overnight. Hypothetically.... If I am a CM of a state, I would build a planned city next to the adjacent city. I would promote the planned city as a haven for the middle class. I would like to introduce all the world class amenities a city should have, including a waste treatment plant, recycling units , labour housing colonies and a fast railway/metro service that connects with the main city under 2 hours (something like RRTS + metro) Then watch the magic unfold. The middle class would move out of the said city in droves and shift their real estate investments into these smart townships. The core city will be emptied out of permanent residents, leaving only the rich, poor and floating population. Once the core city starts getting emptied, real estate giants would swoop in to consolidate all the small land holdings. They would then start building layouts and business spaces in once slum areas, attracting a new set of middle class back into the city. A city's development is only as good as it's aspirational class. Today, middle class in India yearns for proper livable standards, with lot of greenery, parks and shopping complexes within walking distance. Simply put, we are now at a point where our middle class can start funding the growth of India's urban sprawls in a much more planned fashion. All that's needed is a political and financial will. I believe Hyderabad is going down the same route. Its a nightmare to develop the old regions of the city, so the government is planning a massive extension of its metro to its outskirts and adjoining regions without completing the connectivity in the city. These regions are already well connected by 4 lane roads, however, the government is going for an overkill simply to shift the growing population to its outskirts. If we can pull this off, how hard can it be to develop full townships from scratch? Well, spearheading employment generation and good public welfare facilities would be a start. Will never happen but still, dream on until even that becomes anti-national. Overpopulation is the problem. Overpopulation. Centralisation. BIMARU. Thanos time 🌚 Tweet this to the mayor or the governor of your state or even the prime minister! See what they say! >India is, generally speaking, a poor country. Dude. I'd swear that so many people in this country (specifically the middle class) can't even accept this basic universal fact. They are so oblivious to the reality. They see all this poverty, crap on road; crumbling infrastructure, our country sliding down each year in all human index indicators, but would get absolutely mad if you say that India is a poor country. Not only that but would start blaming the British soon after. And if you ask them about their (beloved) politicians looting the country today then they make a surprise pikachu face. You can't clean a country where people have such deplorable attitude. Each Individual’s responsibility India's growth was about to explode for the past 75 years. I would wait sitting down. Good comment Wait for 2024 Most people on Reddit from India are upper class and privileged, so you wouldn’t find the actual solution because it’ll take that away from them: Redistribution of wealth. Blokes like Adani and Reliance always look to mint money. Just looking at the CSR of these guys would give you a clear message of their intent. If they are really concerned about the people of India, for a start, I challenge Adani and Reliance to open a school and a hospital in every single village of India and keep it running. You can’t Because of the population being as massive as it is, someone from an upper middle class can go their whole life with very little exposure itself to the reality of the country. Most people I grew up with are oblivious to the world around them Ain't happening brother (you can make tier 2 cities more greener but that's it) Even if we clean the whole city the brutalist architecture kills the vibe Why are you dickriding Adani 1 would mean converting either agricultural or forest land to city. 3 & 4 are results, not policies or solutions. Many cities are , and the most practical comment in the thread > specifically the middle class India's middle class is largely an illusion. The supposed middle class are really people who are one financial disaster away from poverty. Not being broke, they will fall back into poverty. Demonetization followed by the pandemic decimated this middle class and the sarkar, in their wisdom, refuse to release any data that will paint a better picture. Every single person on this subreddit is wealthy. maybe not as wealthy as you would like to be, but wealthy by indian standards. NYC is still dirty lol with trash everywhere. Thanks dude! I am not in favor of demolishing slums. Even cities like NYC have \"car-homes\" which are basically a moving slums. Others live on slim back ally where garbage is thrown. Maids will not be affordable without them, there will be labour shortage, etc, etc. Moreover these so called slums are only affordable rent even for middle class. 1bhk apratments/flats are like 30-40k in Mumbai. The problem lies with the other country's media which highlight these areas and downplay India's image. They will never highlight poor and dirty places of NYC and we think out cities are so ugly. Yes. Any mega construction in this country will facilitate a lot of political kickbacks. Which means that, even our political class should be incentivised to rearrange our urban spaces. Indian cities are ugly because they are overcrowded . Until there are at least 2-3 metropolitan areas in each state, the condition will remain the same. I’ve said this before, criminalisation of littering and any other activities that can make the country impure in the physical sense with strident measures. People are just so used to not caring about public property. Not sure if I agree that every person here is wealthy. When I was in university, many of my middle class friends, and yes they were truly middle class used to get extremely triggered by any criticism of India. After that they would take their scooty and drive through potholes in the road while breathing toxic air and seeing extreme poverty everywhere. Whether you like it or not, Indians just have this uncanny ability to ignore everything that is around them and live in fantasy world that they get from watching their cheap Bollywood movies. It's one thing to be poor. But it's another to be poor, arrogant and telling others that you're on a clear path to becoming a superpower. Better urban planning Paint the roofs! Shift the national capital and state capitals to new, smaller cities. Applicable wherever the capital city is also the most populated city or business hub of that state (i.e. exclude states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, UP). This would really help in states like Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka, and Bihar and would work like charm in case of the nation. In 15-20 years, we'll have a few more fully developed cities to take the load off of existing cities. Also focus on developing coastal cities. India has a huge coastline. Coastal cities have some natural advantages like easy access to import/export, cleaner air, natural beaches adding to publicly accessible open space, etc. Cities in river banks also work well for states not having a coastline. According to us Civil Engineering and Architecture are nothing, just a waste of time and money......so we plan our own house construction. We have uneven land distribution, in that also if I have 10000sq ft of land...we will make our house at 7000sq ft and will leave 3000 sq ft for future plans and this creates mess...... according to me all such slums should be broken.....and a new big multi storied apartment should be made by the government on the same place. That's none of the business of all political parties in India because they are busy in doing _other things._ If anyone including common man cared, India would have looked much cleaner. In India, people are more interested to fight on whether North is cleaner or South is cleaner raging on their smartphones. It's not actually Independance day but Transfer of power day or self governance day If you think about it. By saying it I'm not committing crime or offense, unless you consider me as blasphemous So, like, Navi Mumbai, Noida, Gurgaon, New Town, Gandhinagar, etc.? What's your problem dikhead??? True no question about it. It should be mandatory for these giants to give at least 20% back to the underprivileged. SO WHAT ABOUT RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANISATIONS SITTING ON CORES AND CORES OR RUPEES???? If they all put their wealth together no one will be HOMELESS. Only thanos can come and help make India beautiful Instead of spending money on new developments, I would rather create systems where people could deposit trash and receive a certain amount of money for each kg deposited. This would give the poor additional income as well. That combined with existing trash collection systems (if they work as they're supposed to) should be enough to at least clean up the streets. 😂 Cover them up like we did when Donald Trump visited by burning all slums and invading your neighborhood It's a combination of infrastructure and culture. Both are going to take time (at least 20 years) to get fixed. Infra - function of government revenue. The fact that most Indian administrative bodies are poor, has been covered elsewhere in this thread. As GDP goes up, so will tax collection, and consequently, cash allotted to infra development. In order of priority, I would think garbage > sewage > electricity & water > roads & sidewalks > parks & other beautification. Attitude - corruption & tragedy of the commons. Partly education and partly increased infra will solve for this. India has very high competition for \"high quality\" resources. This translates into corruption being a way of life to get things done. As education (also an infra problem) goes up, Indians' collective behaviour will improve. Here's hoping for a century that belongs to India! Cheers to that Completely ged rid of stroads and starting a better garbage collection system where every building will have garbage bin according to it's population and do invest in garbage collector trucks unlike most of the municipality who uses utility van/trucks and these projects won't have a private contractor it will be personally handled by municipality with proper billing There is no reconstruction without demolition. Remove humans and let nature thrive. In my opinion, what we are seeing is not the problem. The slums are the side effect and people living there are the victims of inequality and illiteracy. There are too many things to be done to solve this and it is not a single solution that will fix all of their problems. India has lifted more than 400 million people out of poverty in the last 20 years, India has the 5th largest economy by GDP nominal and India's tech sector is quite vast and second only to the bay area. India has progressed a lot in 20 years, which human index indicators are u talking about? By investing money India's TFR has already reduced to 2.1 ie replacement levels, population is not a problem now, in fact a stable population is an asset in a world where majority of countries will start to have population declines Beat me to it By changing the people’s mindset first. It is so difficult to do that. Yes, but have you seen videos of Bronx and Queens from 1970s and 1980s. It will totally shock you. LOL. But it has changed. It was far more crowded. Using thanos principle 😬 Our urban planning principles are western. There is this uncalled for race to \"copy the west\". We have cities that have survived and sustained beautifully for thousands of years, but we don't study them to understand city growths. We don't study the policy/urban design/ demographies of East - China, Japan etc. Cities and regions with similar population densities and cultural roots. But will blindly run to participate in \"future of urban cities\" conference in London and Dubai ! There's a distinct difference in the Eastern and the Western worlds. The west is a logical-data driven society , while the east is steeped in beliefs, culture and deep rooted faith. We have lost our cultural rootedness amidst this \"vacuum of foreign motifs\" era and globalisation. If we are to bring about any change, we need to exorcise the cultural colonization of our minds, and fundamentally rethink who we are, what we want and what we build. Urban development is a complex process, that evolves from unique history, transcends social and economic trends, and leaves ecological and cultural footprint. >Maids will not be affordable without them, there will be labour shortage, etc, etc. Wow. Out of context but that seems a little insensitive. I am okay with not completely displacing a whole set of people for the purpose of \"development\". But your argument that we should keep the slums so that we can get maids and cheap labor is insensitive. I would infact love to see improvement of sanitary conditions in the slums because everyone deserves a sanitary place to live and be in a place which promotes upward mobility. 3 is a policy because some states are only focusing development on 1 or 2 cities. States should focus on multiple cities. >Maids will not be affordable without them, there will be labour shortage, etc, etc. In USA, those slums got gentrified. I mean rich \"white\" people moved to those areas and made them \"rich\" areas. And addressing your point, I think that's why I said we need to increase per capita income which will ultimately lead to people not able to hire maids or maids will enough money to live in a nicer place or people start moving to better jobs which also happened in other countries. Every rich family in NY and London had maids and servants but it became highly unaffordable for most people to hire any. The very basic thing is to inculcate civic sense in the citizens. It angers me to no end when there is such a lack of it, that we literally have to spell it out, not to throw litter on the road, no spitting, etc. It doesn't matter if there are plans to station dustbins, and make a systemized waste disposal, when the people themselves are idiots. That's why, it's no use until and unless people change themselves. Quickest way - Remember what our heros did during Dolaand Trump's visit. Consistent education, planning & maintenance. Town planning is a must, no construction should be allowed without town planning. Installation of more dustbins across the commercial areas, and residential. Teaching cleanliness as duty in schools. What is happening is that posh colonies were planned, and people are quick to complain about bad street, light, garbage etc and since they are influential, their work gets done. But in majority of congested areas, the local parshad / municipal which is responsible for this, usually eats up all money, and majority of these colonies, love to live in dirty surrounding, especially during monsoon. There would be very minority who would want things like town planning, cleanliness. Note that all these congested areas are not cities, but Urban villages. They were villages, which got turned to urban. Noida, New Gurugram, NDMC (New Delhi Lutyen), Chandigarh etc are examples of planned cities. We all know why cities are not clean but nobody will write them here. Delhi is set to overtake Tokyo as the most populous city in the world, soon the list of 20 most populous cities in the world will be filled with Indian cities, Urbanisation is still happening in India, people are still poor, cities aren't going to get rid of slums or congestion anytime soon. It's not possible unless you destroy the entire city to ground and rebuild it according to a strict plan. There is no space between the buildings, there is no garden at homes, no front yard, no backyard, every idiot is living in high rise jails, luxury or not. Population should also decrease to 25% of the current population. It's not possible 🙆 There will always be poor people relatively speaking. There will always be a section of people who will struggle to buy a home. By educating \"Breaking down existing all together and start with a clean slate...\" That's where the problem lies. It has never worked in any part of the world and it will never work. There is a famous urban design theory by Scottish biologist Patrick Geddas, called \"selective surgery\". When you have certain part of the hand infected, you don't just grab the whole arm and remove it from torso, you try to identify the problem and try to resolve with such an intervention that there is a minimum effect on whatever is functioning correctly. Similarly we don't have to create a whole clean slate, we identify the problems and try to resolve while still Maintaining the basic idea of our city's urban fabric. Government does not see Slum redevelopment with an approach of selective surgery. Or with any approach at all to be honest. Instead they bulldoze the whole goddamn area and make 20 storey so called \"affordable housing\" as a mean to resettle the slum somewhere outskirts of the city and the precious land of the slum which is in heart of the city goes to builder lobby for their next flashy luxurious schemes. The multi storey housing which government provides is not at all appropriate for the life of the people of the slum. A multi storey building meaning you have to provide facilities like elevators which are so costly that the people from that background will never be able to sustain such facilities, in the end these people move out of those indira awas yojana because there are no jobs for them nearby where they live in walking distance, the cost of maintenance is too high for them to live and they live such a lifestyle where their connection with ground is very important and living on 12th floor is never going to be appropriate for them. And now they move back to informal squatter where they can find and we are back to square one with slums generating somewhere else. So it's a vicious cycle that keeps on repeating. And we blame it on the poor and immigrants for this issue. There are many good examples done by various architects and urban planners to find various ways to tackle this. Search and read about Aranya low cost housing project in indore by Ar B V Doshi, or Belapur housing in Mumbai by Ar Charles Correa. I don't need to be CM or PM, I just need the government to listen to institute which is raising voices for these issues, listen to urban planners, designers and architects. Gentrification \"Catching up\" is ambition. How would you do that would be a solution, because it's not simple like make infrastructure and tier 3 city becomes tier 2 city. Investment has to be brought in, working conditions have to be set in such a way that those cities become more attractive than tier 1 cities, which isn't a simple task. Lol. Okay le'ts start with our GDP [per capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) . We get destroyed by countries like Dijbouti, Honduras, El Salvador, Vietnam and we're neck to neck with Bangladsh. We have more poor [people](https://theprint.in/national-interest/sub-african-india-much-of-africa-is-richer-than-us-has-better-indicators-while-we-diminish/672235/) in this country than sub Saharan Africa. So that is the economy part. What about our vishwaguru press? [We](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slips-in-world-press-freedom-index-ranks-161-out-of-180-countries/article66806608.ece) are 161 out of 180 countries and falling. Want to breath? [Most](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/39-indian-cities-among-worlds-50-most-polluted-report/articleshow/98636612.cms) polluted cities of the world are in India. What about our genuis CEOs in America? [We](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/average-iq-by-country) are one of the countries with some of the lowest IQs in the world and dare I say even \\*cough cough\\* Pakistan \\*cough cough\\* surpasses us. But bu---but our standard of living is increasing? Umm how about we beat places like Iraq, Bangladesh, Iran and Palestine when it comes to [Human Developement Index?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) And then there is hunger index, and a few more in which we are at the bottom of the bottom. Sure we progressed a little bit but now it's back to regressive policies because our mind is now on other more \\*important\\* things. And I know exactly how you will respond to my comment, but hey let others enjoy that part of it. :) Government incentivising affordable housing I dont see that happening in near future. City planning and its implementation is mostly depends upon municipal corporations. And local corporators and bureaucrats are some of the most corrupt and inefficient people in govt. At state and central level there is corruption but atleast they'll implement some schemes and projects even if its in poor manner. Local govt will not even do such thing. Yes I have and it had come a long way for sure. The first step doing this would be to establish top notch Medical research institutions across the country. Not just hospitals which test surgery but actual R&D. Allocate high budget for healthcare and research at the area which would fund the brilliant minds to do quality research in this institutions. With this I hope they would be able to achieve brain surgery related breakthroughs. It might be about removing the shitty part from someone's brain or produce lab grown brains which mimic the natural once but just without the shitty thoughts. Now the biggest part of this exercise would be larger than the COVID vaccine program. It would be the biggest operation known to mankind which has been done at this scale. Admit every single Indian in these hospitals and have their brain operated or replaced to act a little civilized and with some civic sense in both public and private spaces. This would do wonders to the Indian cities and villages. It would drive out garbages being spiled in random places. The municipal authorities of different cities would be ready to clean up the city and take necessary actions to preserve its cleanliness. /s So what if you can copy first world countries in urban planning. Indians are dirty by nature and will turn it into shit stained brown anyway. Get your basics right first like following traffic rules, taking a bath, queueing properly and having some manners. For starters: Fine for littering/spitting in public - Make it a national moment just to convince people it's the evil in our society. People always need a common enemy, things would sort out itself. I would go as far as forcing people to pay up for or take part in clean up drives. Creating incentives for moving to tier 2 or tier 3 cities - jobs, special subsidies for businesses, discounts on utilities, quality education etc. Rich and middle class would see this as a great opportunity. Poor will also benefit. Limit properties one can own in the same district. Additional taxation on each property purchased after the first. Something I would like to think further on by taking help: Encroachment of foot paths for stalls. Infrastructure maintenance. Regulating immigrant entry/exit >Paris was dirty and filled with crime. Was? By leaving them 🤷 [https://worldpoverty.io/](https://worldpoverty.io/) \"we\" can't do anything about it, sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Unless the corrupt politicians do something, it's gonna stay the same. you see it can't be done in one go, you start with really backwards rural areas and then you design them and govt shouldn't do it by themselves contact big organization and you sell them designed plans and land for that and let them make their organizations there and plan how to make it into better city to make people move there but govt should only do the infrastructure planning not make actual buildings like they're doing they should just sell plots to other builders and MNC's. you can easily make those rural areas into great cities and ask people to move there not everyone will do but alot of them will which will balance population and after that it's just half century worth or work and India will look really good but problem is government can't work with so much population because they don't hire people because of their capabilities. it's all about connections so never gonna happen this easily things might improve after ww3 The same theory of stabilizing or declining population would not be welcome in India, there is a lot of \"India will grow old, before it becomes rich\" propaganda or replacement rate bullshit with the egs of China, South Korea to make india poor and populated. Beautiful cities are just western propaganda. Our country is the most beautiful country in the world. /s rehgya Saar. Is Dharavi redevelopment a part of this scheme. Whenever i see other indian cities i thank my parents for making us live in chandigarh (: Beautiful isn't about the beautiful architecture of the building. it's the simple clean park, roads , no littering As an American whose spent a bit of time in India and Mexico, biggest difference between Indian cities and American/Mexican cities is NOT resources for recycling (like many Indians think), it is mentality around littering and communal pride in cleanliness and a respect for dirty jobs. Many American and Mexican cities have equally bad options when it comes to recycling, or lack thereof. The most important change that could be made is getting rid of this ancient and terrible notion of 'ganda' jobs. No, actually if everyone picks up after themselves for the most part, things stay pretty clean. Not totally clean, but not totally insane like most of Northern India. Community cleanups are really common in Mexican and American cities, I once suggested that my Indian friend, who was complaining about the trash everywhere, go to one of these, he responded that he had never heard of such a thing and also that he was Brahmin and thus cannot touch trash in case it has impure things in it like poop or dead animals. Sorry but I don't care how good the infrastructure gets and I don't care how rich India gets, until this insanity is fixed there will be no clean India, I just don't buy it. It is actually a subcategory of the number one problem in India: terrible class/caste relations. No respect for people who do dirty jobs and thus no respect for the quality of that work and no one wants to do it, and thus the work doesn't ever get done properly. Not everyone needs to be a garbage man but everyone needs to start treating the garbage man like a human being. I love India deeply and defend it a lot even against self-disparaging Indians, but my God the behavior towards lower castes I have seen is shameful. How to change the attitude then? Yoo, me not so wealthy, warna neet crack krne k liye 2 saal se ghis nhi rha hota, koi pvt clg se nikal gaya hota krke Have you actually read on this topic? Or speaking from the perspective of our school evs books? It's a multifaceted and complex subject matter and humanity might face the opposite of overpopulation very soon Good morals so that we don't throw anything at any place other than bins.।। Cut down the current population to 1/10th its value. Population control only THE FINAl SOLUTION Getting people more money 🤑 so they don't have to live in slums Sarcasm 101 all we need is a electric tram or make car cheap and give low interest loans with no threat of kabza so that they can afford car, there are many ways to make this happen Fractional Reserve Banking has to go Being disciplined, Discipline is the main issue. “everyone gets a plate before anyone gets a second but for housing “ slum looks ugly ? build houses for them. once thats done we can come to reducing the number of cars in city ie public transport, bicycle lanes, car free zones, converting parking spaces into parks and stuff. I am not actually very well read on adani restructuring plan, but people here are talking about creation of malls and stuff with high rise creation. While personal i would prefer medium type housing like 6-8 floors max, as it requires less stringent material but since its Mumbai, everything has to be high rises. I personally will like the idea of horizontal expansion but there is always a limit due to infra needing to catch up. So ghetto, restructuring inside a city is probably a good balance between horizontal and vertical expansion ideals. Am not a urban planner, just interested. Can be wrong, if yes then please do correct. Thanks. Have you seen countries like China and Japan? They achieved a stable population growth rate and hence can efficiently plan schemes and facilities for their people to live a better life. Sure you'll say they are crowded as hell in areas where their people live in small rented spaces or even slums but most of them are already out of poverty. If you see much of the competition to live exists because of the population. Look at the GDP per capita of Sikkim or Ladakh. They have managed to control pop. despite being in 1 billion country. Most towns today have more than lakhs or millions of people and can't provide basic necessities to all. Comments here also talk about population problems. India has too many people. Just acknowledge this fact. While I agree with all the other points people are writing here, I think that getting rid of random shops everywhere and all those random advertisements will instantly make Indian cities significantly better. We can't. It is impossible. We have 0 civic sense. Nukes We can’t. We’ve had 5000 years to do it and have not. So, nope. Sorry. If you want beautiful cities apply for a tech job, go on-site and apply for GC there. If Vivek wins he might remove country quota and you’ll get it in 10 years or so. Japan hasn't achieved any sort of goal. It's an unintentional challenge they are facing of an extremely old median population. They are literally in crisis. China has achieved it's goal by eugenics. What exactly are you proposing to solve this 'issue' for India? The overpopulation myth is astonishing to watch. Yes, we have too many people. You know what's at a much worse state? Food distribution. A staggeringly huge percentage of food is simply wasted. Humanity currently produces enough food to feed multiples more people than currently existing, we are just shit at distribution and storage Finally I am not the only one who thinks like this. I don't care about religion and shit and I don't care about tomato prices and shit. All I want is to live in a clean, hygienic and well planned city with civilized people. Food distribution problems start with more inflation and less purchasing power all directly related to overpopulation. More people will have more money to spend if their family has less people. There are unplanned families as well as hordes of slums in Mumbai eg. Dharavi or most of Kolkata. Even few places in Chennai have them. Abhi to tumhe ye bhi nhi paraya jayega ki inflation, unemployment aur poverty kitna zyada hai (Mudi govt saying sab changasi). Overpopulation is a big problem and to deeply study it you'll need to search outside your school taught curriculum. People live so bad that not one person in the slums comes to help them. Cities aren't beautiful anywhere, what we could do is knock down the buildings, plant trees and plants and what do you know beautiful, and littering is much higher in Indian cities than any other countries, so stop littering also? People stopping their cars to pee in the streets also, this isn't France stop peeing in the streets like a caveman. By reducing population and increasing greenery, also skyscrapers looks shit irrespective of the design Most of india is actually in line with the global average so this argument doesn't really hold up well. Bro is racist to his own race This is so surface level I'm facepalming. let's hear it. what are you proposing as a solution? By mass educating so we create good architects and planners that can transform cities on Ancient Bharatiya architecture with lots of trees and nature in and around it! Not like the west or Middle East where trees are outside the city and not inside where the working population (expat) lives! Just one f thing Proper planning Urban planning and illegal immigrant management(banning) I'm too facepalming by your hollow knowledge. Population control is definitely needed. You think I'm not credible because I'm not providing sources? Well I can but you'll not read them because you're too overconfident and think you know everything about India's economy. According to people like you, a high population is a blessing but in reality it's a curse like in countries such as India. Wait for the aliens to take over. So, they say if every human stood shoulder to shoulder, all of humanity would fill the state of Texas and the rest of land mass would be empty.. Over population or over concentration of humans in urban centers (for economic reasons) is the root cause? are bhosdo jisko khubsurat karna mushkil hi nahi namunkin hai usse beautiful banane ka yehi uppay hai By reassessing your beauty standards and realise beauty in things is a 14 yr old girl's fantasy. Prioritise functionality over beauty. Prioritise wisdom. I'm sure Adani is doing something fine otherwise redditors would be bashing them right and left. Unless govt encourages Horizontal expanding, it's not going to change. I'm not a planner too. Thanks You brits are truly menacing. During the decolonisation period starting after WW2 many countries were crippled including UK so they left India and we too fought for it as many Brits sought to stay here. After that asian countries including us progressed and today we have passed UK total GDP. Look at you blokes now, there's a famous report made by DW talking about poverty in Britain. You people will be going to dark ages. Don't dare to call our independence day anything else. People as a collective need to change. I have seen people from BMWs throw trash on streets. So income is not a deciding factor for cleanliness. Kolkata , I couldn't believe I was living in a metro city. People in south Kolkata legit throw their trash on streets and till 8 am it's horrible. The stench is disgusting. So until people take some responsibility I don't think so the government can do anything. In delhi near India gate people were bathing in the fountains, pan stains within a week. How long can we blame other s when we are the trash? Noticed one thing, clean is really beautiful. Don't need any unnecessary fancy investment to make things look beautiful. Agree strongly on the community ownership bit. What do you mean by 'people like you'. And when did I claim it's a blessing? It's a symptom of underdevelopment, not a cause. Population control in a country like this, rife with caste and religious divide is a ticking time bomb of human rights crisis This is a universal observation, as life improves, people have less children. Attack the problem from the correct direction instead of getting angry at random people thanos ko chutki bjani pdegi Read your POV and you'll know you're supporting high population growth. Nobody flexes it in India. Population control is possible if people will agree that there are many people not getting basic amenities. It's the direct solution to this problem. Even in 50 years we'll have people living in slums if things don't change. By control I don't mean killing people, more people should use contraceptives and know urban or rural family planning. As for the caste and religion divide, even with pop. growth people are engaged in politics and causing them. It's impossible to solve that given the rich diversity in this country. I don't think you are aware of the history of pop control efforts in India. Obviously family planning and voluntary contraceptives are a great initiative on paper. I've been in the weeds of this, including NRHM, etc Which is why I added, \"People need to agree upon doing it\". Indira Gandhi's govt back then made sterilization compulsory instead of offering benefits for doing it. Her govt made it clear they are a dictatorship. Aur paper me cool lag rha hai doesn't mean it cannot be done. Somebody needs to take an initiative and raise awareness to tell people to go for it. It's the same herd thinking as parents pushing children to give JEE despite them wanting other ways of earning money. If we make our mind then we can do anything. Majority should agree for that. Rather than aiming to make our cities \"beautiful\" we should aim to make our cities more equitable with proper access to basic facilities like sanitation , proper roads and healthcare to all and sundry. We as middle class/upper class think of these spaces as aesthetically displeasing, however for many it is a space they inhabit and would probably spend all their lives in. Poverty is a big issue in India , try it as you may to sugarcoat it ,make tall claims of being a vishwaguru or what not. It is a sad reality that a considerable chunk of humanity here is denied basic amenities , let alone a lavish lifestyle. >disposable income is on the rise What? WHERE? Agreed. Shit tsunami. Huge shit tsunami. You’d have to demolish all that old crap and build new stuff I guess. It’s a great start. I wish more people would take it seriously. First of all there is no city planing😅, Indians should stop fucking. How are you going to make them stop? Why should i stop them. No one will admit it, but indian are fucking too much. They need to stop. But i doubt that will happen. All problems in india can be solved if indians stop fucking, but not gonna happen. If anything indians will fuck more. If pointing out the truth is racist then so be it. To enhance the beauty of Indian cities, a comprehensive approach is needed. This includes effective urban planning, improved infrastructure, efficient waste management, creation of green spaces, aesthetically pleasing architectural designs, pedestrian-friendly zones, heritage conservation, community involvement, public art installations, stringent regulations, education, smart technology integration, green building practices, traffic management, accessible public facilities, support for local markets, mixed-use development, rainwater harvesting, fostering civic sense, and a long-term vision for urban development. Through these measures, cities can become cleaner, less congested, and more aesthetically appealing places to live and thrive in. Some of users are answering \"stopping overpopulation\", no it will not change it. Japan has similar population density as india have yet they have super clean cities. Even mount everest have human waste which is visited by less than 1000 people per year . So the answer is not stopping overpopulation but could be effective waste management and changing the mindset of indians. We need a Singapore policy. In Singapore, littering is taken very seriously, and strict penalties are imposed. Offenders can face fines ranging from SGD 300 to SGD 2,000 for the first offense. Repeat offenders may face even higher fines, community service, or even prosecution in court, which can result in steeper fines and/or corrective work orders. Additionally, public education campaigns and community involvement are used to discourage littering and promote a clean environment. I wish I could say this sentence to your dad Bro haven't even explore 8% of India and talking about changing culture India is more diverse than europe and you judge the whole nation by exploring one state Pehle CM ban toh le fir gyan chodna itna asan nahi hae eak baar cm kejriwal se puch lena kitni gand ghisni padti hae cm banne ke liye Eak bar cm office maeh ye Baat bolna agar ye Baat kejriwal ko ya yogi ko bologena toh chutad lal kar diya jaega itna asan nahi hae Bro likes to be slave To call on them to give up illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. - Marx Step 1.) Remove all garbage (extremely heavy civil fines for littering) Step 2.) Bury all electric lines underground. Step 3.) Full all potholes Step 4.) There is no step 4 Unfortunately this gov doesn't care at all about urban dwellers. So gentrification then. That has worked well everywhere /s Hitler bhi yahi chahta tha toh maeh ye kehe sakta hu ki app sab hitler fans hae Ha Bhai. This is why it will remain a fantasy. I only said it out loud the stuff that appears to be common sense. And anyways, its already happened before. Noida is a prime example of that. I just wish it could catch on a larger scale app around India so that we can reform our urban sprawls at a much faster pace. There is a lot of money that can be made too, by every class possible. By getting rid of a third of it’s residents. By bringing Britishers back After all most of the Indians are running to their countries so why not bring them back again? I think one major step, would just be to have a better garbage system in the cities. Have you seen how garbage pollutes the air? The smell is unbearable. One low hanging 🍑 Bring back the Night stars ✨ I think we should make a law so that the outdoors light does not fall on someone else's property, and it should have least sky glares. Please upvote restablishment after atomic bomb No Hitler was specifically targeting a group. Thanos killed everybody he didn't discriminate between caste,religion or race.True Equality was achieved by Thanos.Hitler is no where near 🌚 Baron Haussmann enters the chat > Not sure if I agree that every person here is wealthy your opinion or agreement is meaningless. A monthly salary of 10,000 puts you in the richest 13% of india. Anyone working here is earning more than that. By your statement i am assuming you have never been out of India , please visit these places like NYC and Paris , we are not even 20% close to their standard. We have not urban planning. No civic sense . Honking vehicles all over . The fact that Google material is what is necessary to combat this problem speaks volumes about our society. I would like to draw your attention to jamshedpur which has a private municipal corporation operated by tata steel they had road sweeping machines in 1990.Most of the areas were illegals occupation but still good work Build a fake wall so that other won't be able to see that it exists. Eliminating the poors This looks like dharavi. It is literally the biggest slum in Asia and most living in it wouldn't move even if you gave them free housing. Like Hiroshima Nagasaki ? One child policy One of the root causes. What global average are you talking about? You're talking about fertility rate I presume. I'm talking about the current population. Apart from China every other country is far behind us in population. There aren't enough jobs nor resources for everyone. Curious to know. Why should \"ugliness\" be always associated with slums? Why are we not willing to consider that as just a different world which is as beautiful as anything else? Even the places that do look “””good””” in Delhi have so much fucking dust it looks like it rains dust instead of water. Seriously, Delhi is the dustiest place in the entire world, it’s literally everywhere, and looks horrible, shitting up even green colonies. China has proved that population doesn't matter. We need better governance. Because OP asked what you would do if you were PM/CM. Anyway, I don't think fucking is the problem. The thing is that everyone wants kids and is pressured into having kids. Mammoth task, I tell you.. it is said that india is a country of contradictions. And there lies the problem. A mammoth task I tell you. It is said that India is a country of contradictions. There in lies the problem. However, there is nothing humans can not do once they put their minds and resources to it.. \"Before creation must come destruction\" Well that's the only way we can expand the roads and make more high rise buildings By electing educated people. Public execution for corruption. Regardless of political party, real estate mafia is controlled by politicians. It is in their interests to keep cities disorganized, so they can build more flyovers, underpasses, etc. instead of proper town planning and functional infrastructure. Once it becomes a cultural norm for such garbage to be publicly executed, then over time, they will care or at least pretend to care. Change people's mind Very simple. Behaviour and discipline of the public. Sanitization workers - waste management - advertisement laws - road laws actually being followed - proper urban planning and zoning - more green space and walkable areas rather than roads - public transportation (metros) and building around those areas and rezoning them - smog and pollution control. Gonna be honest, the older generation is gone and expecting them to follow anything is gonna be a setup for failure. It’s up to the younger generation really. This is why schooling for all is a start and in the schools teaching life skills such as water conservation (don’t leave the tap on), personal hygiene, sex and health, and impacts of climate issues from a very young age (staggered start of age 5-6 - first thing kids learn is washing hands for 20 seconds, germs, brushing twice a day for two minutes and as they grow older they teach the sex and health stuff). They do this here in western countries (maybe not the US but look how they are) and it does have an effect on social outlooks and skills. Visiting India I can see so much potential but it’s an attitude thing. People like living the way they live because they don’t know the better way or think it’s impossible. It’s quite literally as simple as not littering, following road rules, proper zoning for all new construction, and treating things respectfully almost as if it was their own. Everything else will follow. Slowly and steadily expanding the city limits and developing the remote places will perhaps serve the existing cities better in controlling the huge migration from villages to cities for their employment opportunities. More cities, better distribution of the population, better planning for city infrastructure Pahle hamko sudhrana hoga bhai I can't be done that easily all have to pe planned You can never make an Indian city great. Period. Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder nice username btw ressurect Hitler lmao Affordable labour is India's selling point if income of people increase no one will set manufacturing in India. IT companies will shut their Indian offices. People hire drivers for their 20lac car in India bcz of cheap labour not bcz they really need drivers. We don't need tesla in India as we can hire drivers for Rs 5,000/month and that person gets employment rather than doing farming which is loss making business in India/ You can’t, as long as slum dwellers have voting rights they can’t be showed out."
