    "selftext": "I was extremely excited about attending the G-Eazy concert at the Backyard Sports Club in Gurugram. Given the stringent safety measures in place to enter the venue, one would assume that the police officers present were there to protect us. However, to my dismay, while I was in the fan pit area, a police officer not only touched me inappropriately from behind but also behaved aggressively when confronted.\nIt is deeply troubling that the very officers entrusted with our safety at such events can become predators themselves. Although I hesitated to report this incident earlier due to concerns about my identity being disclosed, I realize it is better late than never. I am sharing this experience now to ensure that such individuals do not traumatize others in the future. No one should have to endure such a frightening and unpleasant experience at an event they attend to enjoy themselves.\nKindly share this, if not please suggest any platform where I can report such an issue without my identity being compromised 🙏🏻\n",

        "Report him to the police .but i dont think u can just keeps some dudes face and accuse him of sa without proof",
        "How old is this incidence? You should always report it as it happens and while I understand the real world problems but you should always try to lodge as official a complaint as possible. If you don't share, hoping for change will just be wishful thinking.\n\nHoping this blows up and this incidence gets looked into. Kudos to you to finally muster the strength to share the incidence.",
        "Azharuddin?",
        "If I remember correctly, G-Easy came to India sometime in early - mid feb. So this is about 3 months old at least. \n\nWhy didn't you report it in time?",
        "I think enough people have explained how these questions are not relevant. \nThe harassment still happened regardless of the time frame and also, we live in a shitty, regressive, judgy, scary country for women. It is very difficult to get any sort of justice in this country. \nIt might take time in some cases and the time taken should not be a reason to raise doubts.",
        "😂",
        "I do not know what happened, OP alleges something happened. It is for an investigation to determine what actually happened. I agree that reporting is not very easy in India and takes tremendous effort and courage, but reporting after such an inordinate delay of an incident that happened in such a public setting will always raise suspicion.\n\n Such extraordinary delay will always compromise the case unless OP has very good evidence (event CCTV, eye witnesses, etc).",
        "Let the incompetent cops who haven't had a whiff of sensitivity training ask such questions.\n\nLike I said, justice is almost impossible if the perpetrator has means and influence and the victim doesn't. \n\nIf OP goes ahead with this, she IS going to suffer for it. No need to pile on pointing out flaws. The cops, the lawyers, the extended family and the neighbours will do it for her.",
        "My question is very pertinent to OP's post, why is it a problem if I don't take OP at face value?\n\nI understand the problems that many women face in India, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't question what OP is saying. Especially, when the question is this glaringly obvious. \n\nI don't know what level of privilege the policeman has (from the photo doesn't look like a high ranking chap, he probably isn't even an officer). I don't know what level of privilege OP has, but from what she has said, we can definitely conclude she has the means and freedom to attend a G-Easy concert.",

        "Write a tweet and tag all the relevant authorities and delhi police, they will have to reply. If your family is supportive then don’t worry, you can get this pos suspended.",

        "Typical behaviour from a police officer \n\nPolice systems  in this country  need a huge overhaul  \n\nThey need to be properly educated and should be aware of consent n citizens rights \n\nPoliticians don't pay their salary ,it's citizens  tax money that pays their salary ,so they are more likely for inclined to protect and serve citizens",

Use your brain Mr wise. If you know what really happened there then share the info here otherwise play with someone else don't waste my time Mr wise.",
        "I just said consider all possible angles. Don't trust everything you see on reddit blindly, think critically. \n\nI know you won't arrest him tomorrow. Nobody is giving an idiot like you the power to arrest somebody. I used my brain well enough, but it seems like your brain has been damaged by all the AskReddit and anime that you consume. Don't worry mate, we have plenty of things for idiots like you to do, it's reddit after all. \n\nAnyways mate, hope it turns out well for you.",
        "That‘s what the police uniforms in India look like? 😂",
        "I never watched anime. And I think probably you should investigate this case and give justice, after all you are the one who consider all possible angles when you are at a social media platform where Somebody posted a bad experience they had. Yes I agree that it could be fake as same as it could be true. That's where I shared my perceptive on this post. Indeed it's Reddit after all where brain damaged people like me and no brain creature or some entity like share there opinions on something that not part in their course of life. \n\nI am not hoping I am really praying for people like you to get brain (that's not possible anyway) or change into some cyborg with higher intelligence (but this would take your lifetime). Anyway I think there is no good for you in this case",
        "Let the law take its course? A statement like that has VERY LOW impact in a country like india. Our judiciary is a joke, the law has yet to take its course on 100s of thousands of cases.",
        "So for sexual harassment, you should just stfu?\n\nThis is a discussion and potentially trying to garner attention from authorities, so there will be an investigation held if the police and authorities manage to see it, or OP reports it\n\n\n>the AskReddit and anime that you consume. Don't worry mate, we have plenty of things for idiots like you to do, it's reddit after all. \n\nImagine claiming moral high ground over something people enjoy, like congratulations you watch hard-core edgy movies????",

        "That mf hell is bent on disproving OP's claims 😭. Bruh why would she specifically wait 3 months to file a fake complaint 😭?",
        "With the sheer quantity of false rape cases, something that I have experienced personally as well, I don't particularly see anything wrong with an opposing point of view. It's actually very much needed for a debate but I would agree that the question could be framed better.\n\nI would rather ask what OP was afraid of that made her stew, play the event in her head over and over and over again, punish herself for 3 months before she decided to take action? Childhood trauma, previous sexual assault, toxic or abusive partner or friends etc. It would help the rest of us also understand what OP went through, others in our social circle went through better and reassure herself and us to be able to trust her completely and provide the support she needs. Sharing such details is never easy but it needs to be done in a comparatively safe space like reddit where no-one really knows you before jumping into the horrible cesspool that is the Indian Justice System.\n\nThe emotion driving these questions needs to be support and care, rather than denial. \n\nI am from Delhi so I have had decades to ponder and discuss this but I could be entirely wrong here so don't take my words to heart.",
        "I agree with this. Hope OP gets justice by this flawed justice system",
        "My mum was raped by my uncle (not the one that emigrated) perpetually for years when she was a minor\n\nAs a result, this baby raper uncle decided to use his connections to try to bring me down, from me being a young child, so that I wouldn't grow up and come after him. He even made his own son a trans, so they could try to foist the trans on me as a way to 'get me out the picture' to save his own @ss. His son was a fair numpty as it was, so he thought I know, I'll make him even more demented and make him go trans. That's the level of deviant scumbag were talking here.\n\nSo you think you've got it bad, I've been getting grief for decades, for my OWN MUM being raped, I GET THE GRIEF!!\n\nif that ain't f_cked up, I don't know what is"
