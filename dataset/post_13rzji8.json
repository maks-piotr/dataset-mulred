        "Healthy Lunch (it can be personalized per your needs)\n\nStep 1. Make a batch of khichdi that lasts 4 to 5 days and keep it in the fridge. I have a container that has lapsi, red rice, moong dal chilti, black channa, and remnants of nachni. I keep adding grains and pulses to this container on a whim so the khichdi mix is always eclectic. \n\nFor daily lunch:\n\nSlice a quarter of a cabbage finely. Slice half a bunch of spinach finely. Add an onion if you like. \n\nSaute all the above vegetables. Add a portion of khichdi to the vegetables. Stir well until the khichdi is warmed up. Add a pinch of salt. Break an egg into this mix and stir continuously until the egg is well mixed. Don't let the thing dry. Turn off the gas.\n\nSlice 3 cloves of garlic and some coriander finely. Mix it into the food and stir well."
