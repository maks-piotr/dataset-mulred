Finally did some freelance jobs (I'm a college student) and ordered one on ebay.com, from a \"Top Rated Plus\" seller.\n\nAbout 15 minutes after making a payment of $200 (and creating an account when asked), I received an email that my account was suspended \"because of activity that we believe was putting the eBay community at risk\". ??? WTF\n\nThe email contained almost no information that was useful and read like it was written for sellers that try to commit fraud. I obviously hadn't put anything up for sale. There was also nothing useful as remediation on either the email or their site's bullshit support section. There was an option to \"request a call\" buried in the support site, but the only options in the country drop-down were US and Canada.\n\nI eventually stumbled across the twitter account \\\\@askebay, who redirected to ebay.co.uk. Initially it looked the same, but surprisingly that site had an option to request a chat or email after signing in. Finally, a human! But they told me the same thing as the email word for word, and that \"this reprimand has no end in sight\".\n\n  \nSo I told them \"fine, I don't care about the account, what about the order?\" Their response:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8i1r1k2czkd1.png?width=1861&format=png&auto=webp&s=5189baa781006da26849d21dfa132824a4b34a65\n\n...at this point I could only ask them to send me a copy of this conversation as an email so that I could show this to my bank.  \n  \nI don't know what, if anything, I did wrong signing up, but Ebay certainly hasn't attempted to make it clear or remediate. I only hope the bank is willing to take this as proof and reimburses me (I kind of messed up there because I used my debit card instead of credit in a hurry).\n\nIf you were thinking of making purchases from Ebay, just know from my experience that if something goes wrong, there is nobody to help remediate and there is \"no end in sight\".",
