        "Probably true, but it used to be much more tolerant.",
        "Nope. I'm old enough to remember a time when we were quite tolerant. Wasn't a utopia by any means, but we definitely used to be better (at least here in NE. It's all shit now obviously)",
        "Hey, they made a Vegetarian quarantine zone, the sentence implies they're not allowed to sit anywhere else. should ban them from everywhere else and lock them there.",
        "Forcing people to accept the dietary choices of others is also another opposite form of discrimination. If a group of students want to restrict their social group that is a free exercise of assembly and speech. \n\nMuslims are not forced to accommodate non halal choices, neither are devout Hindus. This is a constitutional right.",
        "This is why you should always mock people who call themselves 'pure veg' (literally a castiest term, just say you're veg) or think it's just 'personal choice'. They don't just keep it personal, do they? It's not a matter of dietary preferences but discrimination.",
        "Umm but they were not being forced to accept the dietary choices of others...\n\n The article mentions that the students\n 1) declared certain areas for vegetarians only (rather than making the personal decision to sit with fellow vegetarians)\n\n 2) declared this on their own, in the hostel canteen. It's not their dad's place, the hostel can decide vegetarian zones, not some random students!",

Its not that they are forcing anyone to eat veg with them rather its the opposite in most of the cases. I have many friends who always force me to eat non veg and often even try to feed me non veg without me knowing.  \n\n\nCan we not except people's personal choice even while eating?",

My mother for instance would also call herself a \"pure veg\" meaning that she does not eat non veg at all yet she would often cook us omelette  at breakfast, would you call her \"castiest\", before as far as I know my mother she is not. I for instance like to use the term \"predominantly vegetarian\" because I am not a strictly vegetarian guy and I do eat chicken though it's very less.\n\nNow I would not call myself non-veg eater because I eat very very less but then I can't call myself veg either because I do eat non veg sometimes.

        "If it was merely the verbiage then that would be fine, but the fact that vegetarians do shit like refuse to eat from an utensil that's also been used to serve non-veg is proof that it _does_ mean impure in that sense as well.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "'Vegetarians only': IIT Bombay students complain of food discrimination at hostel canteen",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Honestly speaking, when does this constant saga of discrimination end? One religion is pitted against another, one caste tries to oppress another, and now it‚Äôs vegetarians now reserving separate space for themselves in IIT-B mess. When will India become inclusive again and start respecting each other‚Äôs differences instead of imposing themselves and their views on others?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "‚ÄúVegetarian only are allowed to sit here‚Äù Excellent command of English displayed by a freaking IIT student. > When will India become inclusive again Never was. This only Probably true, but it used to be much more tolerant. Nope. I'm old enough to remember a time when we were quite tolerant. Wasn't a utopia by any means, but we definitely used to be better (at least here in NE. It's all shit now obviously) Hey, they made a Vegetarian quarantine zone, the sentence implies they're not allowed to sit anywhere else. should ban them from everywhere else and lock them there. Forcing people to accept the dietary choices of others is also another opposite form of discrimination. If a group of students want to restrict their social group that is a free exercise of assembly and speech. Muslims are not forced to accommodate non halal choices, neither are devout Hindus. This is a constitutional right. This is why you should always mock people who call themselves 'pure veg' (literally a castiest term, just say you're veg) or think it's just 'personal choice'. They don't just keep it personal, do they? It's not a matter of dietary preferences but discrimination. Umm but they were not being forced to accept the dietary choices of others... The article mentions that the students 1) declared certain areas for vegetarians only (rather than making the personal decision to sit with fellow vegetarians) 2) declared this on their own, in the hostel canteen. It's not their dad's place, the hostel can decide vegetarian zones, not some random students! People are free to eat what they want. Not free to lambast others over what they eat. Or forbid them from sitting in the canteen of the college they attend. Fir shuru ho gya. Angrezi bolno se bade hojate hai? ü•© sahi kia, hum bhi yahi karte the . kutto ko unki jagah pr hi hona chahiye Exactly! op is talking about inclusivity and respecting each others differences and then have a problem with people who prefer their own personal space while eating. Its not that they are forcing anyone to eat veg with them rather its the opposite in most of the cases. I have many friends who always force me to eat non veg and often even try to feed me non veg without me knowing. Can we not except people's personal choice even while eating? Pretty sure the canteen staff types and sticks those up I‚Äôm going by the article. Some students had put up posters proclaiming ‚ÄúVegetarian only are allowed to sit here‚Äù on the canteen walls Asking for halal food and insisting on pure vegetarian food, never mind the practices associated with the latter, are not comparable at all. It's a good thing right? Let them segregate themselves so you can eat in peace. Lol why would a student print that? It must be written by the canteen staff. Also, when did English start relating to intelligence Someone should just put chicken on their table lolololol How are they gonna check like anyone can pretend How is being pure veg castiest? How is it different from being vegetarian? What's pure about being vegetarian? Maybe ask your parents, the ones who taught you the term. The entire concept of non-vegetarian being impure is completely casteist. This is actually quite common in many colleges. College mess/canteens don't allow non vegetarian food and this has been for a very long time. In many schools also. It's quite common. Yes. These dogs know exactly where they should sit. Which is why they wrote that only they can sit there. Let the regular humans sit far away from them for fear of getting bit. I think pure veg is when they don't eat egg also There is nothing wrong in being vegetarian but the purpose is to be not harm other in any manner intentionally. Drawback outweighs moral benefits (if there are any) when you develop a sense of superiority or feeling of disgust/discomfort towards others who are not vegetarian. Some people adhere to strict vegetarian diet. Cooking any sort of non vegetarian items would just go against their belief systems. Good that IITB managed to be inclusive and accommodate such people. It's not like other messes don't serve non vegetarian food. The meat eaters can always eat there. Why are we going backwards‚Ä¶ what is happening in all over India??? When was someone‚Äôs food choice were so much of anyone else‚Äôs concern‚Ä¶ This Gujaratification‚Ä¶ of India is shocking and this is spreading really fast‚Ä¶ Colleges mostly use this level of english, such notices are made by ordinary labor folks ‡§ö‡§æ‡§à‡§≤‡§æ.. ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§≠‡•á‡§¶, ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§≠‡•á‡§¶, ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§≠‡•á‡§¶, ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó‡§≠‡•á‡§¶ ‡§Ü‡§£‡§ø ‡§Ü‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§≠‡•á‡§¶.. ‡§ï‡•Å‡§†‡•á ‡§ö‡§æ‡§≤‡§≤‡•ã‡§Ø ‡§Ü‡§™‡§£? Vegetarian is worst diet.... These casteist vegetarian will make india nutrients deficient... Do u know Pakistani has more IQ and height on average... Wonder why? Yeah it's meat üçñüçñ well, people of other religions are fucked I was thinking about this while taking a bath today, we have never been inclusive. Earlier (pre modi era) we would just think for potential reasons before blaming it on the outgroup but now we just skip that step. We always had scapegoats, it's nothing new nor will it change anytime soon. I think a lot of people whom I know use the term \"Pure Veg\" to tell that they are strictly vegetarian and do not consume non veg at all. My mother for instance would also call herself a \"pure veg\" meaning that she does not eat non veg at all yet she would often cook us omelette at breakfast, would you call her \"castiest\", before as far as I know my mother she is not. I for instance like to use the term \"predominantly vegetarian\" because I am not a strictly vegetarian guy and I do eat chicken though it's very less. Now I would not call myself non-veg eater because I eat very very less but then I can't call myself veg either because I do eat non veg sometimes. Hence the differentiation \"pure veg\" and \"predominantly veg\". A lot of people use the term \"pure veg\" simply to tell that they are strict vegetarians unlike me. Is that castiest...? We have a magician here he pulls facts straight out of his ass . Pure vegetarian means that they don't eat anything even remotely considered non-veg. It's like saying a solution is pure solution. Or how people say that this is pure marble or pure gold. It's not impure in that sense, lmao. It's like saying this marble is pure or this necklace is pure gold that, meaning it solely consists of that thing and impurities are everything that are not 'it' in its context. Hello I'm a Marathi person but I never was able to find the meaning chaila can you explain its meaning ik it's pretty random to ask lmao i have met a lot of people who say veg to mean they egg, but pure veg to mean no egg. If it was merely the verbiage then that would be fine, but the fact that vegetarians do shit like refuse to eat from an utensil that's also been used to serve non-veg is proof that it _does_ mean impure in that sense as well. Similar scene at one of Reliance Jio‚Äôs office at Bengaluru. One cannot eat food anywhere in the office except at the food court. The food court however prohibits non veg food even if it is brought from outside. Next hindu only Next upper caste only Being a vegetarian, I can say one thing that smell of non-veg is very nauseating. I used to eat non-veg when I was very young, at that time I used to salivate now quite the opposite. you/they can‚Äôt make up definitions of things. veg is veg .. there is nothing like pure veg. Yes, but pure veg is not used for that. They add different adjectives for that. In real life, people use veg for all plant based stuff + milk + egg, while pure veg for plant based stuff + milk. You are welcome to think that there is no correlation whatsoever between the term \"pure veg\" existing only in India and this particular sort of vegetarian casteism also existing only in India. But you should really not be surprised if so many people consider it more than a coincidence. Except that soon it would be 90% of the tables exclusively for ‚ÄúPure Sanatan Vegetarians‚Äù So why are vegetarians, who also eat egg, implied to to be impure? Same can be said for some of the Indian vegetarian good. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Just ask the white people who complain about Indian IT workers heating up Indian curries in shared microwave ovens at office. We only think it‚Äôs discrimination when it happens against us! I am not denying that vegetarianism is not used as a way to differentiate against people of oppressed castes and muslims, it definitely is and very commonly, but I was talking about usage of terms in real world. It's the sub section of \"pure veg\" people who do that. If it makes you think that I saying this cause I am pure veg or even veg, then no, I am not. >> Cooking any sort of non vegetarian items would just go against their belief systems. Why do the tables need to be reserved? You think IITians run Korean bbq on the table?! This shit has been going on in campuses under the radar. Not surprised here. My friend can't even make chicken Maggi in the hostel because the other Brahmins and UC pure veg gang keeps complaining about the smell when they use all the fucking masalas in the world to cook their own foods. Being a rational human, I can say that there is nothing more nauseating than a person showing pride in declaring themselves as \"pure-veg\" An old lady scientist (tamil) refused to shake my hand because i was non veg and gleefully told me about how she wouldn't visit my region because the plates we eat from probably already touched meat so they were not clean to eat from. Lots of weirdos out there Yeh gujjutification nahi hai. Lots of youths Today are more radicalised than we know. Man I can't stand the strong fucking smell of masalas. Only people who don't eat typical Indian curry will understand my plight. damn you got it wrong lol, saying pure silver doesntly imply gold is impure, if this doesnt get in your head maybe you should start focusing on your classes Lol... So vegetarians are pure.... vegetarians who eat egg are also pure... and vegetarians who also consume non-veg once a while are also pure... Why overload the term \"pure\"? What is the need to declare some as pure? DONT KNOW WHY THESE IDIOTS ARE MAKING THIS A RELIGION ISSUE. A few kids doing stupid stuff do not represent the whole religion like Muslims don't represent terrorism. You hear veg and you start attacking hindus and santanis or muslims or what not. In my IIT we had a whole floor for only veg people and 2 floors for non vegetarians, it doesn't make it wrong and benefits both sides. Also it has been going on for years now, there hasn't been any problems. It was done to handle the huge volume of non veg eaters, nothing to do with religion or caste. Negative cutoff wala hoga Well, caste based reservation makes india inclusive but 1 seat reserved for vegetarians make it exclusive. You are OK with caste based reservation but this is not ok Not all. Some do. Painting people with the same brush based on the religion or caste which they were born into is silly, unfair and dangerous. This is why the hate politics works wonderfully well. We are so eager to get into us vs them, be it based on race, language, living habits, customs, caste and religion, that politicians regularly use this to make people fight against us. These kind of nonsensical acts can be dealt easily by the college admins. It is the duty of the govt to make sure that college admins do act. check this out only shld have nool What's wrong with that? But previously people were not this much openly bigot. There was some shame. Modi and his Dalal media changed everything You are okay with caste based discrimination but not okay with reservation I guess they are trying to say that you can only eat vegetarian food there . Hanji... Ho jate he. Considering these are future engineers whose knowledge and engineering career is useless without command over English language Beat them up, them pure veg muscles are probably not developed Chicken maggi doesn't even smell or taste like chicken.. is doesn't taste like meat at all.. wtf are they on about? Glad Im not living among these kind of retards Sounds like your being facetious but China, Japan, Korea, Europe consume a lot of meat and they are highly developed. While India is extremely backwards No one is forcing them to eat non veg or cook non veg Ok. Karlo downvote. Koi self respect thodi chahiye. Meri bhi pehli bhasha angrezi hi hai kyuki Mai English medium se padha hu, parantu samajhne ki baat hai ki angrezi kavel ek madhyam hai. Koi teer nhi maar liya angrezi jhaad ke.

Bhasha seekhi ja skti hai kisi bhi vakt par, in bacho ne saalo mehnat science me ki hai na ki angrezi me i eat non veg and i love that, if you want to discriminate over food choices than f you , go f yourself I have multiple vegetarian friends few of them are baniya, Jaina and pandit sometimes when we all go out for lunch or dinner when us non vegetarian friends order chicken or mutton they simply shift to another table next to us or as waiters to join separate table beside us they don't like waiters to serve their paaner dish with same serving spoon use to serve chicken and also some of them feels uneasy but they don't discrimination us and we also respect their boundaries, it's about morales they don't like Animals to slaughter or in their religion its prohibited to hurt other living organism so as a democracy we have to respect their choices also, like I don't eat beef because cow is worshipped in my religion but if someone Sit beside me starts eating beef I would simply leave I can't force him to stop eating so being rational I would leave my seat go to another table Angrezi keval ek madhyam hi nahi ek bhasha bhi he.

Drawback outweighs moral benefits (if there are any) when you develop a sense of superiority or feeling of disgust/discomfort towards others who beat their wives. Height:- IQ:-https://www.worlddata.info/iq-by-country.php Ik u r ignorant piece of shit can't even do a google search... Btw avg height and Iq of Japan , Korea and china is more than India... It's all nutrients rich diet my friend this pure veg fanatics ( not just Brahmin can be found irrespective of the caste) has ruined us... It's like tichya aaila said in a faster way which sounds like chaila. You are overthinking it. It is a short form of purely vegetarian. See below Purely in a pure manner. \"act nobly, speak purely, and think charitably\" entirely; exclusively. \"the purpose of the meeting was purely to give information\" This is using the 2nd definition. There's so many issues with people forcing their food choices on others. This isn't one of them. Like if in a sentence someone asks. Are you vegetarian. And the other person says yes. And then they go, but you eat egg? No no. Pure vegetarian. Vegetarians always come up with some stupid comparison ?? - no thats what words are - made up shit with definitions. also thats how language works. ^Vegeterian. IIT-Bombay üòé I‚Äôm an Indian-American, so may be missing something, but most even orthodox Indian vegetarians here are accustomed to eating around and in the presence of meat? Seems like the complaints of discomfort/smell/etc go out the window when they reach America. I myself am a staunch vegan and the strict food segregation in India makes absolutely no sense. ^ VegetErian. IIT-Bombay üíÄ I am just a non-vegetarian. I dont go around and introduce myself as a pure non-vegetarian. But the so called self-declared pure vegetarians, keep going around and introduce themselves as \"pure vegetarians\", even when no one bothers about their food habits. Why? Why are they so insecure and need someone else to validate them? Why do they take so much pride in emphasing that fact, even though it was mostly not even their choice? They are always so aggressive lol, can't apply proper reasoning at times How will you pretend eating a veg meal when you have a non-veg meal? By this definition, someone who is pure non vegetarian would be someone who only eats meat. Your issue is with people, that doesn't change definition of the word. Pure can mean more than one thing. You can replace pure with lacto vegetarian and it's the same thing. Would you be OK with that. I am vegetarian. But I have literally never told anyone unless asked in context of what I would like to eat. Pure as in purely vegetarian. Some vegetarians eat egg, some are only casual meat eaters... It's a spectrum. Purely vegetarian is used for non egg eating vegetarian. Correlation is not causation. Simple statistics bro. have you watched ‚ÄúThe dictator‚Äù. Vitamin B12 deficiency can do that to people!! Or maybe they were just misunderstood!! They meant that meat esters can both sit n stand there You will have to be a carnivore to call yourself a pure-non vegetarian. Pure-vegetarian makes sense. The purpose of college and school is to have no discrimination but here it‚Äôs totally opposite. Thats why we wear school uniform so that everyone looks same. No rich and poor difference either. But iit are run by a bunch of upper caste racist people so u can expect like this in every iit. Go to IIT madras and u can see it for urself. He can't, they stopped him from eating meat and his muscles have also deteriorated. You're being downvoted by their guilty conscience. ?Make your own choice hurting noone===Beat your wife? Makes sense. Lolw I went to an IIT almost 30 years ago. Vegetarians and non-vegetarians ate together in the same mess in that IIT. Some vegetarians may choose to go to a different table, but without making any fuss about not eating with non-vegetarians! What you describe must be new It's the mood of the nation for the last 9 years... no surprise in the attitude of these students who, unfortunately, are going to expect similar exclusivity in their future. Demand and supply buddy . It's cause people prefer to dine at pure veg for relligioua reasons . Just like Halall dominates the meat industry . Don't see anything wrong here! A lot of vegetarian people find the smell of meat to be nauseating. Also they believe in non violence and the thought of animals being killed and served at the same table makes you feels awful. Would you be okay to sit on a table that serves food that smells awful to you? Also how about dogs and cats being served ? Would that make you uncomfortable? Wasn‚Äôt that bad before, whatever justification you keep on by minimizing the Modi era shit. So why do a lot of vegetarian people not like to eat in a non vegetarian environment? 1. The smell of meat is awful to people who have never eaten mean in their life. It is nauseating and makes you want to puke. 2. A lot of vegetarian people adhere to non violence. So meat being served on the same table makes you feel anxious and helpless for the animals killed. 3. A lot of vegetarian people do not like to eat in the same utensils used for non vegetarian food. They do not want to use plates and bowls in which meat was served or prepared. Non vegetarian people ... would you feel equally comfortable eating on the same table where cats, dogs, rabbits, silkworms, deer, elephant, cockroaches, ant flies, tarantula, snakes, human fetus, octopus etc are served? I'll have to advocate the vegetarians today, yaar. I don't get it. I eat everything, but if someone has a problem with meat, why can't they have a special place to sit and eat? I have talked to many vegetarians most people associate meat with trauma and animal killing, I think everyone deserves a safe space to practice what they want to. After all we're in a democracy. Why is it that you're making someone uncomfortable for following their faith? This unreasonable attack against vegetarians has to stop. In fact it's the only diet in the long run which is really going to reduce the carbon foot print on this planet. In another argument, I had someone brought up caste into this, it's despicable saying that vegetarians are upper-caste people, looking for a special place to eat, and start discriminating on them, there's no difference when you're a racist, if you attack a man based on his caste/faith you're despicable. These people did not say lower-caste are not allowed, this is a place for people to eat their diet, due to whatever reasons they want to, this has to be accommodated. Please stop and focus on better things. Protesting every small thing will only make us look dumb. edit: downvoting without an explanation, thanks. I can't believe you think practicing a diet is castiest what a fing non-sense, few of friends who are SC/ST have gone completely vegan and strongly oppose non-vegetarian food. I have also seen brahms drinking and eating meat, food is a personal choice, I just can't understand what goes into your mind, when you say \"pure veg\" is a castiest term. At risk of revealing my caste because these so called intellectuals make me do so. I'm a non-vegetarian I never had a problem with a vegetarian having special requirements. due to whatever reasons they chose to be one. this needs to end. It's not like there are no mixed eateries at IITB. This is just plain non-sensical to be pissed at someone just doing what they're doing because that's what they like to do. Isn't this discrimination... Imagine studying your ass off sacrificing your youth and then finding out you don't even have basic rights Why are you acting like people bring in live animal and slaughter it in the canteen.üòÇ Unless you are fixated on it, you really cant make out what kinda meat you are eating. Half the time I have to ask 'mumma ye chicken hai ki mutton hai?' 'Beef hai? Ok' How does meat being served, of an animal which is long dead make you feel anxious? I understand the moral highground, but if you are so easily anxious you should consult a therapist. I have had and even now have so many veg friends, in college and even now in the office. We eat on the same table. Never once have I had someone move away or getting anxious. If I was so uncomfortable I would move away to another seat instead of marking territory. Its cultural difference. If I have the one who has a problem I need to adjust and accomodate, instead of earmarking seats and shit. Why not ? At NMIMS they don't even allow you to get non veg from your own home. The audacity of some colleges. Bro, when was India inclusive? Are you from a parallel dimension Shhhhhhhhh !!! ü§´ You can't make sensible comments here. This subeddit is only for irrational hatred, especially towards Hindus and upper castes. You have been warned. Making sensible comments here might get you banned. Halal is simply what is permissible in Islam, and as far as food practices go, halal food is just food that has been sourced and prepared according to Islamic tenets. Nothing in Hinduism explicitly forbids something when it comes to food. Eating Halal food or having such food on sale doesn't go against the beliefs of a Hindu; anyone who claims otherwise is nothing but a Hindunat prick. There are sects of Hinduism that demand a pure vegetarian diet. Oh shit, sorry, I forgot Hindus are not allowed to have rights in this country. Demanding a pure vegetarian diet is not the same as having food habits explicitly encoded in religion. I bet those same Hindus would have a problem with Jews and their kosher food. Coaching centres and coaching oriented colleges have been coaxing students to ignore languages for a long time now, so it makes sense. Vegetarians believe in non violence? üòÇüòÇ Are you kidding me? Woahh! Upper Castes (so oppressed) are facing a backlash for being dickrots for decades, colour me surprised ü§Ø. As a vegetarian I see nothing wrong with this, most of the vegetarians don't even like the smell of meat, fish etc. When I'm eating with my friends, we usually sit in a group but with the vegetarians on one side and the non vegetarians on one side and no one has a problem with that This is not related to religion or anything Lol, a shit-speaking budha. >Vegetarians believe in non violence Subah subah naya naya joke sunne ko mila üòÇü§£ And no one is forcing to eat veg food exclusively either. It's better to keep them separate and accommodate the faith system of people who don't eat meat. Most of the hate here is unwarranted and, frankly, just reverse racism. I can't color you surprised, but I can color you a racist. By saying it's plant based meat/soya chaap and if they don't believe they can eat to check ü§£ They are not being forced to eat meat. I don't eat fish and hate the smell, but I recognise that in public places I can not demand people stay away from me when eating fish. If a Muslim demands that certain seats in a public canteen are reserved only for those who eat halal food (or Jewish demand that certain seats in a public canteen are reserved for those who eat kosher food) they are also wrong. Maybe the backlash has something to do with people who use religion as an excuse to demand ban on shops selling certain types of (or all) meat shops? Just a thought. It's not about casteism, they say pure veg because there are vegetarians who eat eggs sometimes, there are also vegetarians by religion but still like to eat meat. Pure veg only means strictly veggies and dairy products afaik and vegan is not even eating dairy products or anything animal related Then find your own spaces away from non-vegetarian spaces? There are many food smells people hate - I can't stand the smell of fish, some people hate the smell of durian. Many people in the West have a problem with the smell of our spices. Doesn't mean you as a student get to demand certain people can't use seats in a public canteen. I do get the other points though. Appropriate reaction might be to petition the uni for a separate section for vegetarians, not hanging up notices on your own. Also, nice job slipping in that human fetus in there. Very comparable to everything else. A certain group of people give jobs only within that community and that is forced world wide through certificates. That's the highest level of discrimination there! If it is a corner of 10-20 percent of chairs. I am fine with it. It is not discrimination. Just a private space. He's being downvoted for stupidity let them sit there what's the issue? You should understand that they're not comfortable with meat smell, few feel cringe looking at meat... did you talk to them why they've put that post before posting over here? Irony is talking about inclusivity and creating division by posting here instead of working together with them! >A lot of vegetarian people adhere to non-violence. Like beating a fellow human to death being under the suspicion that they ate meat? honestly, i get it. as a vegetarian, i do not want to see people around me. i never sit around people who are eating nonveg. but hey, thats just me, im not forcing anyone else to move These canteens are a public space. Not anybody's home. If you can't learn how to live socially with other people having different food habits, you are better of staying in your room and eating there. Or at the very least, just try to find out a corner somewhere to eat your food. No reason at all to designate a space with a specific condition and claiming that as your own. Their pet cow ate the English lessons book. Fuck you and your state. Maybe, they meant only Vegetarian food is allowed. If so, I'm still wondering, is there any place in the campus/canteen where the Non veg food can be consumed. Everyone in here complaining about reserving a few seats, probably a few tables at maximum for those who prefer to eat with no meat on their table. I'm guessing the entire mess isn't restricted to vegetarians only. Big deal, let a man eat in peace. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything. Nobody is disallowing vegetarians to share a tabel with non vegetarians either. What's the harm if you are able to create a safe space for those who are genuinely uncomfortable about having meat besides them where they eat. Inclusivity means being able to create a safe space for everyone ü§∑ To clarify, being a vegetarian, I don't have a problem sharing my table with those eating non veg. Though I can understand what some other vegetarians feel like. I see no harm in just letting someone eat on peace comfortably. Gosh It's like ayoo, waw That‚Äôs the point isn‚Äôt it- is it any more nauseating in India than the West? Meat is meat anywhere, I thought? How is it possible for folks to find the smell of meat so nauseating they cannot even sit next to certain people in India, but then when the cross the seas they have no problem being in such close proximity to meat and meat eaters? My parents have had to go to company office dinners or neighbors birthday parties in steak houses. But they will never step within a non-veg restaurant in India. The entire nation should adopt this. India a vegetarian country. Lmaoooo as if he can In India, vegetarianism is just another form of casteism. Try home schooling >Human fetus Be for real. I can't stand the smell of ripe jackfruit or cooked karela. It makes me want to puke. Abb? Like another commenter has said below me, no one is slaughtering the animals on the spot. A). B) \"Anxious and helpless\"? Do you drink milk, eat curd/yoghurt etc? Because cows are under immense stress then and us meat-eaters don't pretend it's some sort of superiority. How are you enjoying your morning of mental gymnastics? Go and tell Modi Ji to remove caste based reservation This. And one's command of English is often reflective of one's caste-class privelige. It is very much possible for people in good institutes to be good at their technical fields while not having a very good command of English. Ironic that a thread calling out casteism has a comment of this nature. Ambedkar Periyar circle busy doing this, instead of studying No wonder 25000 SC/ST students dropped out of IIT's in the last 5 year's I think this is not discrimination. It's like the issue with the third gender bathrooms. The gender is not comfortable using the other gender's washroom. In the similar way these vegetarians are not comfortable sitting beside a person eating non vegetarian...idk... couldn't relate. Is it that only vegetarian have acess to canteen or it is seperate space for vegans and non-vegans? Please explain. Yet these future engineers will have salaries more than almost any other Batchelors degree in India. In light of that I think most employers find their 'engineering skills' sufficient. Maybe this is the rarest case where the minority suppress the majority, because the closet non-vegetarians are too much of a coward to accept it in public. What a lot of doodoo I don't think it means impure. You can be pure veg or pure non-veg or pure *I eat anything that moves.* I don't understand why people are becoming so hateful. Ethical reason is one big part in why some people choose to be vegetarian. And it follows that some can't bear people eating slaughtered life right next to them. Care to explain what is stupid about this? My point is that one person's morality is another person's lifestyle. To the person who it is moral, the idea that it's just a lifestyle choice may be vile. Of course to the lifestyle person, imposing morality is immoral :-D. Neither side is wrong because they feel superior to the other? Or are they both wrong? üñï üñï üñï They got the spelling wrong, so not to worry. Besides, plants are living creatures, right? Or did that change? I don't eat meat but I don't understand the moral high ground that vegetarians hold when their food is also sourced from living beings. I wonder how shit would hit the fan if it was the other way around... \"No vegetarians allowed\" lol.. OP is lacking some knowledge of what is happening around him. This question is not about religion and should not be treated as a question about Modi. There are non-vegetarians in Hinduism. And vegetarians in every caste. Only Jainism has a taboo for non-vegetarian food. I get four or five wedding invitations from my Muslim business friends every year. In every wedding feast there is a SEPARATE PLACE for vegetarian food and more than half of the guests in that row are muslims. Equating food culture with religion is not correct. Lol reddit users with their downvotes. What's the point of discussion if you can't make arguments. So what's the main reason they don't eat meat ? If you care to ask around they don't eat meat because they don't like killing animals for food. Please enlighten me more the most learned one. Moral relativism is full of paradoxes. Suggesting that all moral views are equal leads to chaos and inconsistencies raises questions over protection of vulnerable individuals in such societies by justifying immoral actions. Universal moral truth transcends cultural boundaries . For example, most societies consider murder, theft, and lying as immoral actions, regardless of their cultural background. These principles are often based on the well-being of individuals, empathy, and the avoidance of unnecessary harm. Plato(Socrates) argued vehemently in opposing sophists when they said ,justice is beneficial of stronger or high minded foolishness. He rightly pointed out that it‚Äôs a function of internal harmony of soul, when reason govern the soul over appetite justice prevails. Under moral relativism , it becomes challenging to make moral progress as a society. Moral relativism can hinder efforts to improve ethical standards and promote a more just and compassionate world. So your parents and grand parents are uncomfortable right ? Whenever they can they try to avoid being in the proximity of meat. That's how it is for a lot of people. But in situations where it is impossible to avoid most Indians will suck it up too and probably eat it too. And welcome to the world if you think most people are not hypocrites according to what serves them best. I just started from the perspective of vegetarians. Some better arguments would be welcomed instead of a lot of doodoos. I mean you seem like a very smart person. I mean if that's your personal experience. If you eat meat how are you even alive? Don't you have vegetarian neighbours ? You seem like an extremely smart and well learned person capable of making better arguments. So this is a discussion forum people argue here. I am just stating reasons why a lot of vegetarians avoid meat. Just ask them if the like the smell or feel anxious. I mean if an introvert feels anxious while clubbing and dancing most of reddit users will advice to stay away from such places. It depends on person to person. I am pretty sure you stay away from ripe jack fruit and I would not cut open a jack fruit in your presence. Also human fetus is a delicacy served in some places. Yes I like mental gymnastics as much as you. Every one had a hard limit to the moral high ground. I am pretty sure even if you eat meat you wouldn't eat meat of certain animals. Why though it's just meat. Oppressor caste believe meat is impure for whatever made up reason they have and use it as a tool to discriminate against the dalit, bahujan and adivasi community. They call people impure, untouchable etc. I am just stating reasons for why vegetarian people in India avoid non vegetarian eateries. If you are Indian and have met vegetarians a lot of them avoid even eating in the same utensils. If both veg and meat are being served the utensils will most likely be the same. You are stating your experiences of how your fellow batchmates don't mind it ... I am telling you about people who do. That's not what moral high ground means. I have a problem with vegetarians claiming they are better people for having a plant and dairy based diet. Also the average person who consumes meat consumes animals that are bred specifically for that purpose. Personally, I don't see anything immoral with that. Umm. I am sorry for your life experiences. On similar argument basic. Oppressor religion folks belive non believers shouldn't have the right to live. Oppressor white folks believe black people are beneath them and should be slaves. Oppressor country believes the whole world needs democracy and bombs them to oblivion. .... Yada yada ... And a thousand more oppressor arguments. No am Dodo! > Universal moral truth transcends cultural boundaries. Who made you the arbitrer of universal moral truth? Most societies didn't consider racism to be immoral. Just because now it's in vogue to consider it immoral, doesn't mean it just started being immoral. It always was. I don't think most vegetarians claim they are better people or morally superior people. They just impose it on themselves that they won't kill animals for their own food or breed animals for the sole purpose of killing them for their food. Whataboutism will get you nowhere. This is an Indian sub talking about indian problems. In India majority are hindus, and the majority religion practices oppression against the dba community and that's a fact with empirical evidence. Racism, imperialism is also bad but it's irrelevant to this conversation and tries to diminish the oppressor caste hindus' cruelty and viciousness towards the minorities. bade gadhe insaan ho bhai Whataboutism will get us nowhere. Atleast we are on the same page on something. I stated reasons why vegetarian people do what they do. A lot of Brahmins eat meat too and a lot of Dalits are vegetarians. I am retarded so I couldn't understand your argument better in the context of what I was talking about. Explain like I am five. There are pure veg housing societies here Discrimination and hate has always been immoral (it lead to insecurity, violence and harmful to any society). Racism isn‚Äôt moral value of every culture, every enlightened being knew that it was wrong. It was slavery, racism, casteism was forced from one dominant group on other it wasn‚Äôt moral value and accepted by everyone. For example theft, even a thief knows that stealing things is wrong and consequence is fear of being caught, a thief never wants his children to be thief as well (and would happily want out by some mean).. How many gencat students dropped? \"Well killing innocent animals is also immoral. Every enlightened person knew it and did not want to associate with people who indulge in that.\" You see the problem with making such blanket statements? And for the record across our history most people who induldged in discrimination didn't think it was wrong. The perpretartor of an immoral act doesn't get to decide if it's wrong or not. If they know it's wrong all it makes them is a hypocrite. But the morality of an act is independent of whether the thief knows if its wrong or not. Yes it‚Äôs immoral to harm intentionally It wasn‚Äôt like that before, some fringe stuff here and there but modi and his hindutva brigade are doing this nonsense on an industrial level. Guess we know where to find Sudha Murthy when she visits IIT Bombay campus. What so now just because your state indulges in caste discrimination, you can't think it's disgusting or reprehensible? Ah yes 2cm taller and can you see that average height of indonesian men is lower than Indian men . Last time i checked they have a very meat rich diet . If eating meat makes you smart then why do we have more medals in intenrational olympiads ? Why are we much ahead in terms of research from Pakistan ? Someone said the most sensible thing in comments \"correlation is not causation \" and that comment has 3 downvotes for some reason. And about the 'casteist diet ' thing . Do you think there are no sc/st who are vegetarian? They don't eat meat not because of the goodness of their heart, because handling of meat and dead animal and animal products were lower caste activities back in the day. I believe if you are doing it for ethical reasons then you should be vegan. Vegetarian doesn't cut it. You are still using dairy which is pretty much the only reason in some places certain animals are bred. Discomfort is not a good enough justification for state/school/institution mandated segregation though. I‚Äôm really allergic to peanuts, as in I will have a reaction if I accidentally swallow a peanut product. Do I tell my friends with peanut butter to not sit with me? No. I carry my epipen and live with it, because the act of eating is a right that everyone has and it is my responsibility to manage that discomfort. When did IIT become good english speakers ? what does iit have to do with english ? It aint a NLU bruh The Aztecs were the minority, but they oppressed all the other tribes in the surrounding area. The Spanish were the minority, but they oppressed all the other tribes in the area, (including The Aztecs now). The Mongols were the minority in the greater region, but they oppressed ... British... Romans... My point being, suppression and oppression is not a function of majority minority, but of perception of raw power. Vegetarianism, like the English language and the color of a fair skin is ***perceived*** to be superior, and thus the power is projected hence-way Looks like propaganda. Sometimes Ambedkarite groups do this to instigate an uproar. Surely there are CCTVcams to check \"which\" student did this. It's not like non vegetarian people don't have a place to eat. Vegetarians are a minority in most places. Only about 15-20% of Indians are vegetarians. There will likely be 15-20 messes and another 8-10 restaurants in school / institutions which is being talked about ... Only 1 or at Max 2 will be purely vegetarian where they don't use utensils which has been used to cook eat meat. Some might not even use onions and garlic in their food for certain months of the year. There is no mandated segregation which is meant to be evil against non vegetarians. It is economics ... Where do these 20% vegetarians go to eat if there is no place where purely vegetarian food is served ? Every city or place you visit in India you will see about 4-5 purely vegetarian restaurants for every 300-400 restaurants which serve both veg and meat. Must be the guy who runs the Mess, it's not a Students' job. Authorities said that the culprit is unknown and all the posters have been removed... idk the rest What's the point of sitting separately, let's assume you got offer in Google head quarters in California, you are going to sit next to a beef eating pork eating crowd in that cafeteria. I believe that‚Äôs the case with all of Reliance offices. So they are okay with raping a cow and stealing it‚Äôs child‚Äôs milk, using leather, eating capsules or gelatin or wearing silk? No because I‚Äôm not an adult intolerant bitch. You fuckers sound just like the British who did not want to sit next to ‚Äúdarkies who smell like curry.‚Äù If we want to be clear a lot of the Vedic diets render the water with nauseating body odor. One neighbor in LA did the Hanuman diet and between the restricted food and bathing that couple smelled horrible. If he had not worked from home I wonder if there would have been HR complaints. But they were cool, so we would arrange things out doors like hikes, picnics, etc. And when they invited us for Diwali we just handled it like when we invited them for Eid, they just handled it and we all go along great. Simple answer: don‚Äôt be a bitch, be kind, handle differences that are purely sensory but don‚Äôt matter otherwise. Also, our Philipino neighbor patriarch regularly invited us over for pork and dog roasts. No big deal! We at the salad and had an extra beer. Same here. People, Indians are as racist and intolerant as anyone they complain about anywhere else. One reason I‚Äôve refused all the opportunities to ‚Äúreturn home.‚Äù Bitch, I love my Ribeye and red wine. The Hindus will kill me for the first and my own family will hate me for the latter. Better off in a real liberal open society. and never will No one has to eat veg food, but they have no right to say you can't sit here.. If you don't want meat, don't eat meat.. By your logic most non vegetarians are okay with raping cows and whatever animals they breed for meat, leather and other animal by products? Sure, but I‚Äôm not convinced vegetarians need a separate place to eat. That‚Äôs my contention. Ahh I see, I was thinking canteen = dining hall, I think the decision of having a vegetarian canteen should be left to the campus majority not make it a political issue on reddit though Yeah bro idgi how people are unable to manage sensory discomforts so much so that they are willing to prevent certain people based on personal background and preferences to sit with them. Kicking out a peer from my group college dining table - an equal to me ‚Äî because of what they choose to eat? Nah homie that to me is as morally wrong as eating meat is. Where they line is drawn is pretty telling. What if someone hates the smell of garlic or Indian spices? What if someone finds it morally objectionable that a vegetarian eats dairy products that are the result of raping a cow (fyi, I think vegetarianism is immoral just as much as meat eating is. But I don‚Äôt enforce my beliefs on others because food is extremely personal). Also, what about the discomfort the other group of people might feel for being excluded from a table - why are we prioritizing one persons discomfort over another? Also, if you‚Äôre pure veg or veg or a carnivore or gluten free or whatever, no one is obligated to cater specifically to you in a public space. You‚Äôre food is your responsibility. Nothing wrong with vegetarian restaurants or bringing your own utensils to a table and sitting across from someone eating a chicken curry - it‚Äôs not going to kill you or send you to Hell. It is however wrong to tell the person across from you to move because *you* do not like what they are eating. What gives you the authority to do that? > Some **students had put up posters proclaiming ‚ÄúVegetarian only are allowed to sit here‚Äù on the canteen walls** and they would even force those who prefer non-vegetarian food to vacate the place, the student said. You missed the point where some vegetarians don't prefer to use utensils where meat is being cooked. This is the main reason there are pure vegetarian places. Dining in the same environment will mean that the plates and the cutlery and the cooking equipments are interchangeably used for both meat and vegetarian. No one has the authority to tell people to fuck off from the table hence they have pure vegetarian restaurants so that people know before hand what they are getting into. Just like how you feel that non vegetarian people are forced to fuck off because some vegetarians don't like the smell or sharing utensils... likewise vegetarians feel that you have already asked them to fuck off or deal with the smell and share utensils. It's not like both of these people don't have options. Like I said for 1 mess for purely vegetarian people there are 10 more places where both kinds of food are being served. We were never forward. My point missed you. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having vegetarian restaurants or seperate lines for vegetarian food. But why is IIT Bombay having or enforcing a policy where vegetarians have a specific table or section of tables to eat? You are conflating to separate issues - the preparation of food in kitchens (fine should not touch meat and should be segregated), vs the consumption of food, which should not be segregated. very progressive india becoming a beyond developed nation... /s... not expected from an elite institute like iit b... You should visit IIT Mumbai and ask the people there if they mind. So where does the plates go after the food has been consumed ? In the same dishwasher ? It might be just one small place for about 20 people. There are 18 messes in IiT Mumbai where both veg and non veg food are served together. Also there are about 20 restaurants within campus which serve both kind of food together. There are 6000 people living within the campus. 5880 people have places to go where they can have chicken and paneer together on the same table. Also the issue in the article is some students reserving a few tables. It's not mandated by the institute. You could say it is an issue of bullying maybe. Also each mess has about 40 tables for students to sit and eat. Maybe some students thought of reserving one table for themselves. Nope, they are entitled to have a zone for themselves. It's about accommodation of someone's belief systems. Their belief system is not eating meat.. no one is forcing them, their belief system doesn't and shouldn't interfere with a person's freedom to sit where they want. It's all about creating a space. And such spaces will be created if there is sufficient demand. Baap ki jagah nhi h Jahan marzi baithne k liye. >Baap ki jagah nhi h Jahan marzi baithne k liye. Defenition of public space is it can be equally used by everyone .. maybe you lost the idea of a public space.. >It's all about creating a space. And such spaces will be created if there is sufficient demand. It's not required. Your food habits must not interfere with others freedom. It should be limited to you. Here's the tricky part. Canteen and messes which are a service do not have to be public space as such. They have their own exclusive criteria. And yes, such services are provided after tender is floated for a contract with cooking services. And they are funded from the students' fees. So, they are entitled and should be thoroughly honoured. Here is the non tricky obvious part.. mess works on fees paid by all students , not just vegetarian students. Tenders are floated to include vegetarian food.. and non veg food as preference, tenders are not floated to restrict someone from sitting in a place And here is another fun fact, since it's paid by all students equally, it becomes a public place for students where any student can use it irregardless of his caste, creed, race, or dietary preference.. So it's not paid by veg people alone, hence they don't deserve special preferences ... If they don't want non veg people occupying seats, make your own personal thing with your own personal money.. Train also runs on your money, will you board a train and say no one should sit beside me because it runs on my tax money? What a stupid arguement you have made here Pussy asses who reported my comment Agree. Lol parents love to say ‚Äúindia is such a vibrant country of different traditions.‚Äù That they mean to say is ‚ÄúIndia WAS beautiful when it was all vibrant Hindu traditions.‚Äù Your obvious point is wrong in qualifying messes and canteen as public space when it is clearly run by a private entity. Trains is not even the same example as this. Messes and canteens are run by students for all students.. not just vegetarians.. that's the obvious point. Vegetarians are not and should not be entitled for shit like this They pay the canteen or mess to provide food . That's it The mess and canteen space is ultimately run by college and the food preparation is only the one which is given out on contract basis . Train is just an example, you can apply this in any case.. Your words, not bine - you are the hypocrite, afterall What ? Doesn't even makes sense. You are the one who implied breeding animals is raping them for your own use. Yes, you breed them, get them raped, even boil them alive for your needs. Then preach hate in social media. That is not casteist but that is ignorant. Not understanding that usage of such terms can cause harm in the form of division in the society. Not putting effort in changing your usage after knowing this is definitely being casteist. What about LPU then they are fully vegetarian, would you call them casteist too, stupid indians in the comments. Non vegetarians indians don't even respect vegetarians and you think it's vice-versa."
