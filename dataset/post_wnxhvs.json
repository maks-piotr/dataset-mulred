I spent 23 years of my life in India. I think I drove a bike for 7 years of those 23 years in India(you can get a gearless driver's license at the age of 16).\n\nI assure you, I am not one of those annoying NRIs who acts out of touch with reality when they returns back to India. I am about as Desi as the next person :)\n\nNow, I have been driving a car in America for the past 5 years. So I am used to driving in America and I am used to American traffic. I don't travel to India that often. So I often forget how Indian traffic works till I come back to India.\n\nHere in America when a car in the lane next to yours wants to merge into your lane, they turn on its indicator and wait for 5 to 15 seconds for you to notice. You have two options at this point, you either accelerate and go past that car or you slow down a bit. If you accelerate they merge behind you. If you slow down they merge in front of you. If you don't do anything and travel at the same speed in parallel to that other car or worse, if you match their speed, they will yell at you a lot of times. They flip you off. Basically, it's a dick move to do. It's like asking for trouble. Plenty of people do this shit in traffic in America. But they do it consciously, willfully out of spite. Accelerating ahead of the car that wants to merge into your lane is also a dick move, but it is not as bad as not changing your speed or matching the speed of the car that wants to merge into your lane.\n\nNow in India, nobody cares about lanes. When I used to drive in India before I left for the US, I used to not care about lanes too. When I say lanes, I don't mean the two lanes on the road for traffic going in opposite directions. I mean the lanes for vehicles going in the same direction. There is a broken white line in the middle of the road which marks these lanes. People in India literally travel on top of that white line. Half of their vehicle is in one lane and the other half is in the other lane. And people drive on that white line for hours on end.\n\n[The problem I am describing](https://preview.redd.it/96annvtm0mh91.png?width=1264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ff06d2a9df0e0bcbba2eb2e3d4bb1183cdcfb13)\n\nIf you are used to the way US traffic works, this really really fucks with your brain. Cause you think the person in front of you is trying to merge in and you slow down for them and they don't merge into your lane. Because you slowed down, the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle behind you decreases. That leads to a situation where you would collide with the vehicle behind you if they are not anticipating that you would slow down. Most of the time, since you are the only person who hasn't driven in India for a long time, you will be the only person slowing down. The person behind you won't slow down.  I came very close, to having an accident because of this in 2019. It scared the living shit out of me back then. It took a lot of effort to adjust my brain to the way Indian traffic works. And it took a lot of conscious effort when I went back to America to start driving according to the lane system there.\n\nI understand that we have plenty of bikes on the road. In America, 99% of the traffic is non-two-wheeler traffic. But people here in America pretend bikes are cars and they give them as much space as a car. People might stay that is a waste of space, but bikes typically go through the gaps between cars and other big vehicles, and the space that all the car drivers give them, they relinquish it back frequently. But in India, the problem is the opposite of that. Even cars behave like they are motorbikes and try to squeeze in the gap between two vehicles. But cars are not as nimble as bikes, once a car gets into the space between two cars in two separate lanes, it has to sit there till it reaches its destination. So the space in which 2 cars could fit is entirely taken up by a single car.",

I fully support that we need better policing and driving courses for drivers in India, maybe start training in school?. That being said, have you been to Cali? In Arizona, people call Cali drivers as FCB (Foking California Bass turds). Wisconsin has FIBs for Illinois drivers. In the past decade or so I drove through most of the 50 states (for work) and to my surprise I found that Texans follow speed limit. :)) go ahead buddy Haha..For a sec I was thinking which fucking American state the guy was referring to. Get on the golden triangle highway between Thane and Ahmedabad - you will see dozens of dead dogs lying on the side of the road. It's heartbreaking üò¢ Once you're used to the chaos of being a chaiwala, it's easier to get used to being a aerospace engineer. FTFY That's relatable. But surprisingly I didn't find it hard at all to re-learn bike riding in India. Living in Europe, so didn't drive a vehicle here. I think that's what kept my brain from really getting reprogrammed. Desi to the bones. The first 10seconds after coming out onto the streets were confusing due to hand drive difference lolü§£ In india the indicators are for weddings and the sorts. Remember that snake game which used to be in keypad phones. Guess we played a lot of that üëÄ In the words of Russel Peters, Indians drive on the basis of \"create a lane\". The insurance industry has a good grip on car safety in the United States. For the average person, a bad driving record can be a death sentence if they take your licence away and you can't get to work. If you have alot of points on your licence, your car insurance premiums might be so high you can't afford to drive. Here, in bangalore, paying 10k to a cop to look the other way after hitting a person in traffic is just the cost of doing business for lots of car owners. If you have people that can't be incentivised to drive safely, they won't. You say you are not that NRI but you are that NRI lol. Comparing Indian traffic to US doesn't make sense - that's how it is and won't change. Yes it's hard to adjust when your are visiting, use Uber. Well do you happen to know the zipping software 'WinRar'? Everytime you launch it, it will tell you the package is trial version and ask you to buy it. But you can just skip/ignore it and use the complete software for eternity. No problems. Indian roads to similar. The road is Winrar. The lane markings are buy option. You can skip/ignore them for eternity. Wrong it's for boasting to your relatives from a lower tier town how you have 'x' lane roads in the big city you're from. Haha.. true.. i kept wondering what American state it is!! Lol, I lived in Cali a long time. While traffic is bad, it‚Äôs not anything that would come close to even resembling Indian traffic. If you leave your house and stick to lanes (when they are present only in major roads), for the traffic density in India, you would go nowhere, if the line extends all the way from your workplace, through main roads and by lanes, right to the front of your house. If you can't make 5 lanes out of the 3 present, you aren't going anywhere. Shouldn't be that way, but that's what it is. &gt;Now in India, nobody cares about lanes. What are you talking about? After a stretch of road, another stretch of broken mud path dug up by authorities make people adapt to a road again after that bad patch. Some more road, then no road. Repeat. Pfft, lanes. Fr that asshole who drives on the white line is THE most annoying person on highway, tho for me it has been really rare. Few months ago I had a little accident where my car hit some kids on bike - when I asked them why did you guys not see the indicator - they genuinely told me they are not used to of looking indicator at day time and think indicators are made for night I gave up Come drive in the bay area! Post lockdown people seem to have forgotten how to drive here and there‚Äôs road rage if you mildly horn at someone‚Ä¶ Is there any hope whatsoever of things improving? I remember noticing all this the first time I returned to Mumbai, I was was struck by the thought, that even though this is a rich city with billionaires and crazy real estate, the traffic is like an equalizer for all, almost no one can escape it. Even if someone were to try and throw money at the problem, there‚Äôs only so much space on the road. Can‚Äôt extend lanes beyond that. OP, before you visit India every time, try driving in Brampton, ON (a city on your northern neighbour) for few days. You will do good when you drive in India. Newfoundland and Labrador New driver here. That day i was on 3rd lane from left on 3 lane highway road . And another car was speeding up behind me on same lane. I gave left indicator to go on second to allow it go ahead and moved to 2nd. That mfer came to 1st lane and overtook me from 1st lane on left. I was just speechless for a second. Wtf is wrong with people"
