No delivery charges. \n\nNow about the post. Zomato deliberately makes me not to order from a restaurant which is 9km while allowing me to buy food from the same restaurant but a different outlet which is 17km away by asking me to pay for it. \n\nI hope you can understand",
        "Are you missing what i was actually stating in the post?\n\nThey are not letting me order from a restaurant which is 9km away saying that restaurant is far away. But they are allowing the same restaurant chain but a different outlet which 17km away, but they are asking me to pay for it.\n\nif 9km is far away then 17km should obviously be far enough. its a basic knowledge. But they just want me to pay for it by keeping the restaurant which is within 10km range, by not letting me order from there saying 'its too far away'.",
