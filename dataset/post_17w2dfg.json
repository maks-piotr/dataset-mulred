        "Sad. The guy and his wife are pro-palestine and were shit-talking a zionist. But the sword cuts both both ways.",
        "Indians complain about racism but they are the active flag bearers of it …its the truth",
        "There are 1.4+ billion. There is not a thought that is not being thought in the mind of an Indian.",
        "Bro Jews are too powerful. They control everything. No hate to anyone, just stating facts. Also the killing of innocent civilians and children needs to be stopped asap. It breaks my heart to see those images.",
        "Wow, this is really sad. Despite any skills and qualifications he may possess, this guy will ever get a job at that level in the United States again. No one will work with him there.\n\nI predict a relocation in his future.",
        "They control everything.........\n\nSlow clap.\n\nI thought I was in r/donald for a while",
        "Not so sad. \n\nThe wife was talking in a extremely broken english to a obviously American dude to go back to his own country lol. I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nAnd those were posters of kidnapped citizens. Why take them out. Crazy people we exports to the US",
        "I mean it is kinda deserved considering how he was behaving. Now come back",
        "Should’ve thought of that before being a racist cunt, shouldn’t he.",
        "Looks like someone forgot they are immigrants themselves 😬",
        "People have very low attention span ....he will be forgotten in few weeks",
        "I love the “no hate to anything” crap he stuffed in there too.",
        "IIM - “A” …. Unsurprising",
        "Nope you'd be surprised how companies dig for your background",
        "Finally I’m proud of an Indian in the US. Calling Israel an apartheid state in the US nothing short of bravery. This is a country where companies casually endorse zionist organization to conduct antisemitism training which then try to convince people even criticizing zionist organizations is antisemitism. I’m even surprised that this guy is a Gujarati, rare to see humans with values from that state.",
        "Look at me. Imma go back to my country now.",
        "Yeah just searching his name on google shows all these articles. It doesn't help the fact that he has a unique name in the United states. \n\nUnless he is ready to work in startups who don't care about his background or returns to India, he has low chances.",
        "I guess every human alive should just go to Tanzania/Kenya/Ethiopia and leave the rest of the world for plants and animals to flourish.",
        "Excellent, he’ll come right back here then.",
        "The real irony is an Indian Parsi saying it to an American Jew. You're in the same boat, mate! Neither of you has a nation-state to \"go back\" to, unless you count the settler colony that you oppose.",
        "So glad this happened. Look at the stupid wife’s Instagram profile. She was openly gloating about eating beef / steak and mocking the Hindu community by hurtful and inciting captions.",
        "My guy just went for a racism combo with a single post. Wow!",
        "![gif](giphy|rxy55jHaig16K2TV8x|downsized)",
        "Indians made the tweet go viral and got him fired. \n\nActive flag bearers of racism are the woke brainwashed commies among Indians who pull off stunts like these, on the rest (Indians and non-Indians)",
        "I think we Indians deserve to be discriminated against",
        "middle aged desi techie strikes again 🤡",
        "If they were pro-palestine, they would not have said a Jew to go back to their own country(Israel). The whole Israel exists because of that whole reason.",
        "Indian immigrants staying in the US have their heads so far up their ass. It's like racism is there in our blood. The arrogance of the college degree is showing as well.",
        "I hope relocation won't change things for him. Let him get fucked. We don't need racists in a proper functioning society.",
        "Lol you have no idea. He will get another good job. Not a problem at all. In the end skill is what matters.",
        "They are anti Jews and ignorant. A pretty widespread combination.",
        "A lot of diaspora Jews are actually anti Israel. Anti-jews is anti-Semitism. These guys are playing in Israel's hand. If diaspora Jews receive hate then Israel can keep paddling the nonsense that Israeli is the only safe heaven for Jews.",
        "I don’t know how this ended up on my feed but this comment resonated with me lol. I work with doctors and managers who are majority Indian, the subtle racism they show is kinda sad. Especially how normalized it is. \n\nThis is especially the case towards African or Arabic patients or coworkers.",
        "Proper functioning society that saw 5000 children killed with most world leaders supporting it… functioning society my ass.",
        "It was so embarrassing dude. Like cmon. No matter how much you earn or status you have as an Indian. You will never be equal to whites in the country. Even third gen Indians bear the heat somewhat. Imagine telling a white dude to go back to his country. What sort of echo chamber they might be living in. They should definitely be interviewed.",
        "Have some self respect dude. People were willing to die for honor & you are throwing it away over a video.",
        "That has been my experience too. First to notice the slightest comment towards themselves that could be even remotely misconstrued in a negative way but completely blind to the stuff coming out of their mouths. Same with religion, particularly Islam.",
        "Ok the guy name is kurush mistry and his wife name is shailja gupta. Shailja and kurush both come from India, shailja used to or might be currently working for red chillies entertainment which is owned by srk, so clearly Palestine is not her country, she further told the Jewish guy that all Jewish people are rapists and she have papers to prove that and her dad is a big deal and jew people should go back to Israel.",
        "Buddy they are taking out photos of victims kidnapped by hamas and they also told the guy recording that all Jews are rapist and they should go back to Israel. \nThey have the same hate they are against.",
        "Indian homie we don't got the \"dual citizen\" privilege.",
        "Tbh, if what you were implying was right, he would be anti-Palestine, not Pro-Palestine.",
        "Every immigrant ( which is 100% of USA population) forgets it!",
        "They're just as bad with other Indians they consider lower in caste and of different religions",
        "Should there not have been any consequences to his actions?",
        "That cunt will come back to Indian and ruin someone's day.",
        "You might love to be a doormat but we don't. Don't lump us with your apologist mindset",
        "So are you justifying this guy's actions?",
        "I'm an Indian living in Québec City. I have been asked multiple times why I don't prefer staying closer to Indian communities in Ontario, Canada (like Toronto & Brampton). I always use these kinds of examples to prove my point. \n\nThere's so much hartred within our diaspora, not only towards other communities, but to our own as well. The only time I have ever faced any racism in my five years out of India, is from an Indian or someone of Indian origin.",
        "itni thicc irony haye ram",
        "Red Indians would like to have a word",
        "But they are never allowed",
        "honestly, my hero lol",
        "If this keeps happening America may stop H1B visas from India. Its bad for those, only those specific Indian people who truly love America and are not so conservative like these assholes.",
        "What am I missing here?",
        "I won’t pretend to know Indian regional politics but is there a reason why? I find many Indians in the US to be more conservative than US conservatives. Even though many of those conservatives dislike immigrants.",
        "It's not a new concept. Black people are racist against black people, women are sexist against women. The concept of racism, sexism xenophobia has no limits",
        "> Red Indians\n\nNEVER ever use this term again. Especially if you are in or planning to visit Europe or N. America. At best you will be dismissed as a third world ignorant fool. At worst you will be charged as racist bigot.",
        "Hypocrisy. Many of these people are raised with massively inflated egos and thought to be believe they are better than others",
        "Exactly. He deserves his punishment",
        "F that. Leave him there. \nThere are enough racists in our country. Don’t need to bring back someone that’s left",
        "This story is beyond hilarious.. if it weren’t so sad. Put a IIM or IIT on yourself, think they’re invincible…",
        "If America can forgive an entire sports franchise for calling themselves the Redskins then we can forgive this oblivious Redditor.",
        "Word. I absolutely love seeing arrogant people getting humbled.",
        "Gujarat/ BJP connection via ‘A’",
        "Who made you the terminology police? If something gets the point across to people who don't usually use it in a racist way, what's troubling you? Buzz off.",
        "They have long since changed the name.",
        "*The fool who considers himself foolish, is a Wise One. The fool who is proud of his wisdom, he is said to be a fool indeed.*  \n\n-Gautama Buddha",
        "bro AIPAC can claim over 95% of the people they fund will win elections but you still can't say they control everything... that's a no no lol",
        "The worst part is us Indians are racist to their own people. And that's been there for generations. It's a country obsessed with fair skin for centuries.",
        "The posters are pure israeli propaganda meant to distract from active palestinian genocide. A lot of the people turned out to have never even been missing too.",
        "Okay, but you still dont get it. \n\nTerminologies that are considered racist in a small section of a population cant be held with similar regards elsewhere.",
        "Do u have some source to prove it?",
        "India is a proper functioning society?",
        "He is an oil-analyst, probably will get a job in some Gulf countries.",
        "It was changed in 2020. Not really been long at all.",
        "Not at all… just feel priorities and seriousness of actions seems grossly misplaced",
        "Regardless this sort of behaviour shouldn't be encouraged. You can't fight evil with evil.",
        "Seems ironical in current context but totally agree",
        "People who immigrate are the ones who come from old money or are insanely skilled/talented. You won't hear much from the latter group as they are busy doing things (like those CEOs such Sunder Pichai or scientists). The former are the ones who benefitted most from social conservatism and privilege and are thus pieces of shit themselves.   \n\n\nThey do not represent India at large, but the top 1% of India. (Our population is so big, 1% would be like 14 million, that's more than 1/5th of USA population)",
        "As an Indian, I concur.",
        "He may be employable in Asia or the Gulf, but he's done in New York, at least at the level of firm that he's been working for to date.",
        "you know what would be funny? If these two clowns get sent back after this whole debacle",
        "When will we learn lmao no matter how rich you are you will always be at the bottom when you are in a white mans country",
        "I understand what you are saying, but this is a heat of the moment situation. They've probably heard americans tell them to go back to their country, and thought it was a good time to uno reverse. \n\nIf you read the article, you will know that this situation arose out of their (extra passionate?) support for paslestine",
        "It is misguided no doubt. My sadness is very mild.",
        "I will only agree that zionists have deep influence. No hate for my jewish brothers and sisters who are just trying to live their lives.",
        "Its ballsy. IMO its misguided and they could have shown their support in a different way. But I appreciate the sentiment",
        "Man, alllll of the fairly recent IIMA alumni I’m meeting and hearing about are the weirdest people ever. The institute seriously needs to focus on imbibing some ethics and behaviour classes. It’s obviously a premier educational institution, but people act like graduating from there makes you omniscient and omnipotent. No offence to anyone from IIMA. Just speaking from my personal experience",
        "I would include Philipinos and other South East Asians in the list. But somehow they adore Koreans and Japanese.",
        "*1/5th of US population is 66 million.",
        "My bad! I don't know how my brain arrived at that number. I think I did USA /14 M instead of 5.",
        "More like the hard right wing conservatives who are roaming around with such inflated egos that can be busted with even the minute borderline jokes …but they once they get a open house to speak its no ends to limits",
        "Lol he should know america is ruled by the Jews. And jews are more American than anyone else.",
        "All these words but you still haven't mentioned what we were supposed to call them. Native Americans, is it?",
        "This is different to racism, unlike what New York Post would like to paint it as, his actions and the confrontation were clearly triggered by the ongoing conflict in the middle east. Many people have been tearing down Israeli hostage posters worldwide, the intense grief and helplessness has been manifesting in confrontations where people are lashing out at the the other party. This shouldn't be used to excuse genuine anti-Semitism, but there is a lot more nuance to these situations given the context.  \n\n\nThis shows how easy it is to slap a headline on a video as taken out of context it can be passed off as a completely different story.",
        "go back to your country.\n\nyou 1st",
        "I mean if they don't have residence, then it will happen because he definitely can't find a new job after this",
        "Dude's gonna go around Chicago using the N word.",
        "Yeah that's not an extra for being a racist.",
        "Why are people being fired over such petty things? Israel is no saint anyway.",
        "First off I don't understand how people in the gen z and many millenials too are supporting Hamas as if they are freedom fighters? The propaganda on social media has worked very very well in brainwashing liberals to be in support of the people who would hunt them down for sport, and then laugh and spit at their mutilated bodies.\n\nJust goes to show how utterly stupid, and ignorant most people are. Just support whatever the fuck is trendy to support atm without bothering to even research anything. Ignorance, entitlement, laziness and a complete lack of self awareness is on full display.",
        "He has assimilated well into the culture.",
        "American Indians I guess.",
        "Bro forgot that upper caste entitlement doesn't work in the US",
        "Natives or native Americans (im American). In some areas indigenous peoples",
        "Wow, I wasn't even aware of this huge red flag. We say this in good spirits. Anyway, can you please care to enlighten us more about what is wrong with this terminology. No offence! 🙈",
        "They are in the elite league of global left liberal, even if they choose to stay in the USA they will soon get a good position once again. Let's wait and see how their fortunes roll out. Here also they had a elite left liberal network.",
        "Clown to clown conversation",
        "He'd right though. Israel is an apartheid state that's committing genocide. He didn't do anything wrong, and this isn't racism.\n\nOf course when white people do such things they get away with it, no problem.\n\nGood old double standards and hypocrisy.",
        "Nah, we don't need humans in this world.",
        "Native Americans. Let's not continue white people's wrong labeling because they were so obsessed with finding us.",
        "Nsh, white people don't care. They will just ignore you.",
        "True. People's reactions to the genocide committed by Israel reveal what kind of person they truly are.",
        "Did you even know to read? He is Indian in visa and he said that to Jewish American.",
        "Israel is an apartheid country so you'll tell every jewish man across the world to fuck off to Israel?\n\nWhy don't you spout the same shit to every muslim you find in India or in the west? To fuck off back to some islamic republic etc in middle east?",
        "Vikram sarabhai envisioned IIMA to be able to create future leader & visionaries of India instead it's giving us like of Ashneer, Sugar cosmetics and this kind idiots.",
        "The wife also basically lied and said that she was Palestinian, lol.",
        ">Of course when white people do such things they get away with it, no problem.\n\nIf a white American guy got caught on camera saying that shit to an Indian or any other minority, they’d 100% lose their job, lol.",
        "His girlfriend also apparently forgot that she’s Indian and her surname is Gupta. \n\nArticle makes it sound like she started pretending to be Palestinian, lol.",
        "So far as I’m aware, many native Americans prefer using the term “Indian.”",
        "I’m Indian-American, wife is Indian-Indian. Nobody’s said anything negative to my wife since we came here, and the only time I’ve ever had anyone tell me to “go back to my own country” is when I was living in India. \n\nAs an Indian-American, I don’t feel like a victim, nor do I feel oppressed. Our community has its challenges—internal and external—but I’m sick of certain people pushing this narrative.",
        "I was just noticing how many divisions there are within the Indian diaspora. Religion, language, region, caste, colour, dialect, food, economic, educational… We as a people are extremely judgmental and insecure. Our first instinct is to pull the other person down.",
        "Taxes. They don't want to pay taxes.",
        "Indeed, and we find ways of drawing these lines of division if there aren't any.\n\nIndians in western countries are prime examples of the [drawbridge mentality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawbridge_mentality). It's so crazy that you'd be judged and abused by immigrants who arrived here a mere 2-3 years before you did. I had to block an Indian-origin user on a Canadian sub who abused me in DMs for \"coming here to steal their job\". My job requires French proficiency and engineering experience, the person who said that clearly was capable of neither.",
        "Holy moly. So sorry you had to go through that. It sounds awful. Clearly this person struggles with their identity and projects it onto others. Good that you blocked them",
        "What did all the beautiful wildlife of Serengeti do to you?",
        "You are supposed to say Native Americans in US and Indigenous people in Canada. Or just natives. Red Indian is offensive because they are not Indians. That's not their identity.",
        "Okay got it.\nAnd thanks to the person who down voted my question for my ignorance. 😅🤣🤦‍♂️",
        "They didn't just tell them to go back to the country. They were ripping out posters of ppl who were kidnapped by hamas because it is propoganda in America. This ppl did nothing wrong.",
        "What's wrong with sugar cosmetics, just want to know your opinion.",
        "Yea, it's the same among Blacks in the US.",
        "You would discredit the personal accounts of so many other Indian Americans. I wouldnt.",
        "I dont understand this genz speak. What are you tring to say?",
        "IIRC, she actually did claim to be Palestinian in the video lol. She's trash.",
        "They don't. They keep their jobs, they continue discriminating against, abusing and harassing non-white people, no problem. Most of the time that's what happens.",
        "Have you researched anything at all? There are people being killed , everyday, be it Hammas or Israel, both are violent entities that should not exist.\n\nTo top it all, people are organising protests to stop this conflict and their tax money is used to gift more bombs, no wonder they pissed.\n\nHowever does not condone stupid racism",
        "Yes people are being killed and it sucks. Netenyahu needs to be gone, yesterday! And who are you calling a racist? I'm condemning people that follow a violent political idealogy (not a race) which is being used to poison minds to support an organisation that shouldn't exist.\n\nThere's enough condemnation and focus on Israel already but a shocking lack of focus on the fact that Hamas continue to fight, they continue to hide behind their own people who they clearly don't give a fuck about, and young impressionable minds(the world over) are being brainwashed to believe that they are the underdog, fighting for their people.\n\nIf this is successful, it will further encourage violent, fundamentalist philosophies to infect the minds of gullible people(westerners particularly fall prey)",
        "Oh, shit. I was going to reply, and then I checked your username. I remember you. \n\nYou’re the poster who’s literally *obsessed* with white people, and who talks about racism and discrimination non-stop while making racist and discriminatory judgments about non-Indian people. \n\nOpinion discarded.",
        "Most Indian-Americans I know are successful and well-integrated. \n\nBut I’m sure you know better than us.",
        "There are over a million Indian-Americans. Again, you seem to want to speak to all of them. I dont.",
        "half baked 'engineers' with 1 year MSIS courses in US are finding jobs or loopholes to continue in the US after termination of H1b. This guy is an IIMA grad and will find something. However, good luck with the image hit that he took with  his activity.",
        "Damn man,these people are adults their \"buddhi\" is crap",
        "No worries 😉  Now that they are unemployed, without healthcare, unable to pay EMI/rent, unable to find another job, he and his girl will come back to India by boat 🛶.",
        "I'm speaking strictly to my own experience, albeit in response to a comment predicated solely on speculative assumption.",
        "There is public condemnation of Israel as their strategy gives rise to more terrorists",
        "lol, the Israeli strategy of defending itself against terrorists.\n\nlol\n\njust lol\n\nThey're literally doing what India has wanted to do - go into adversarial territory to hunt down terrorists. And the fact that they're able to do it is a good thing.\n\nWe should salute them and support them.",
        "which one's the parsi?",
        "Bullshit,  when you kill 100 civilians to kill 1 terrorist it's called genocide. They are not fighting Hammas, they are eliminating the population.\n\nBut again, I am all for nihilism and elimination of the parasites called humans, but we should start with people like you first.",
        "Yikes! Proposing attacking a civilian like me for hating terrorism?\n\nSounds like a terrorist.\n\nSounds like you're a terrorist.",
        "Sorry, take my words back , you just some genocide supporting genetic junk. probably more fun to free your intestines",
        "I don't understand these people. One they are so invested in a problem that is not related to their life (these 2 are do not belong to Israel or Palestine ) On top of that they have the audacity to tell someone go back to their country when these 2 are clearly immigrant themselves. what a shame",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Wall Street banker fired over viral video of him telling a Jewish American man to ‘go back to your country’",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Indian man fired for racism. An IIM-A alumni. . The irony - \"Go back to your country.\" in the thickest non-American accent possible.🤣🤣🤣",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Sad. The guy and his wife are pro-palestine and were shit-talking a zionist. But the sword cuts both both ways. Indians complain about racism but they are the active flag bearers of it …its the truth There are 1.4+ billion. There is not a thought that is not being thought in the mind of an Indian. Bro Jews are too powerful. They control everything. No hate to anyone, just stating facts. Also the killing of innocent civilians and children needs to be stopped asap. It breaks my heart to see those images. Wow, this is really sad. Despite any skills and qualifications he may possess, this guy will ever get a job at that level in the United States again. No one will work with him there. I predict a relocation in his future. They control everything......... Slow clap. I thought I was in r/donald for a while Not so sad. The wife was talking in a extremely broken english to a obviously American dude to go back to his own country lol. I couldn't stop laughing. And those were posters of kidnapped citizens. Why take them out. Crazy people we exports to the US I mean it is kinda deserved considering how he was behaving. Now come back Should’ve thought of that before being a racist cunt, shouldn’t he. Looks like someone forgot they are immigrants themselves 😬 People have very low attention span ....he will be forgotten in few weeks I love the “no hate to anything” crap he stuffed in there too. IIM - “A” …. Unsurprising Nope you'd be surprised how companies dig for your background Finally I’m proud of an Indian in the US. Calling Israel an apartheid state in the US nothing short of bravery. This is a country where companies casually endorse zionist organization to conduct antisemitism training which then try to convince people even criticizing zionist organizations is antisemitism. I’m even surprised that this guy is a Gujarati, rare to see humans with values from that state. Look at me. Imma go back to my country now. Yeah just searching his name on google shows all these articles. It doesn't help the fact that he has a unique name in the United states. Unless he is ready to work in startups who don't care about his background or returns to India, he has low chances. I guess every human alive should just go to Tanzania/Kenya/Ethiopia and leave the rest of the world for plants and animals to flourish. Excellent, he’ll come right back here then. The real irony is an Indian Parsi saying it to an American Jew. You're in the same boat, mate! Neither of you has a nation-state to \"go back\" to, unless you count the settler colony that you oppose. So glad this happened. Look at the stupid wife’s Instagram profile. She was openly gloating about eating beef / steak and mocking the Hindu community by hurtful and inciting captions. My guy just went for a racism combo with a single post. Wow! ![gif](giphy|rxy55jHaig16K2TV8x|downsized) Indians made the tweet go viral and got him fired. Active flag bearers of racism are the woke brainwashed commies among Indians who pull off stunts like these, on the rest (Indians and non-Indians) I think we Indians deserve to be discriminated against middle aged desi techie strikes again 🤡 If they were pro-palestine, they would not have said a Jew to go back to their own country(Israel). The whole Israel exists because of that whole reason. Indian immigrants staying in the US have their heads so far up their ass. It's like racism is there in our blood. The arrogance of the college degree is showing as well. I hope relocation won't change things for him. Let him get fucked. We don't need racists in a proper functioning society. Lol you have no idea. He will get another good job. Not a problem at all. In the end skill is what matters. They are anti Jews and ignorant. A pretty widespread combination. A lot of diaspora Jews are actually anti Israel. Anti-jews is anti-Semitism. These guys are playing in Israel's hand. If diaspora Jews receive hate then Israel can keep paddling the nonsense that Israeli is the only safe heaven for Jews. I don’t know how this ended up on my feed but this comment resonated with me lol. I work with doctors and managers who are majority Indian, the subtle racism they show is kinda sad. Especially how normalized it is. This is especially the case towards African or Arabic patients or coworkers. Proper functioning society that saw 5000 children killed with most world leaders supporting it… functioning society my ass. It was so embarrassing dude. Like cmon. No matter how much you earn or status you have as an Indian. You will never be equal to whites in the country. Even third gen Indians bear the heat somewhat. Imagine telling a white dude to go back to his country. What sort of echo chamber they might be living in. They should definitely be interviewed. Have some self respect dude. People were willing to die for honor & you are throwing it away over a video. That has been my experience too. First to notice the slightest comment towards themselves that could be even remotely misconstrued in a negative way but completely blind to the stuff coming out of their mouths. Same with religion, particularly Islam. Ok the guy name is kurush mistry and his wife name is shailja gupta. Shailja and kurush both come from India, shailja used to or might be currently working for red chillies entertainment which is owned by srk, so clearly Palestine is not her country, she further told the Jewish guy that all Jewish people are rapists and she have papers to prove that and her dad is a big deal and jew people should go back to Israel. Buddy they are taking out photos of victims kidnapped by hamas and they also told the guy recording that all Jews are rapist and they should go back to Israel. They have the same hate they are against. Indian homie we don't got the \"dual citizen\" privilege. Tbh, if what you were implying was right, he would be anti-Palestine, not Pro-Palestine. Every immigrant ( which is 100% of USA population) forgets it! They're just as bad with other Indians they consider lower in caste and of different religions Should there not have been any consequences to his actions? That cunt will come back to Indian and ruin someone's day. You might love to be a doormat but we don't. Don't lump us with your apologist mindset So are you justifying this guy's actions? I'm an Indian living in Québec City. I have been asked multiple times why I don't prefer staying closer to Indian communities in Ontario, Canada (like Toronto & Brampton). I always use these kinds of examples to prove my point. There's so much hartred within our diaspora, not only towards other communities, but to our own as well. The only time I have ever faced any racism in my five years out of India, is from an Indian or someone of Indian origin. itni thicc irony haye ram Red Indians would like to have a word But they are never allowed honestly, my hero lol If this keeps happening America may stop H1B visas from India. Its bad for those, only those specific Indian people who truly love America and are not so conservative like these assholes. What am I missing here? I won’t pretend to know Indian regional politics but is there a reason why? I find many Indians in the US to be more conservative than US conservatives. Even though many of those conservatives dislike immigrants. It's not a new concept. Black people are racist against black people, women are sexist against women. The concept of racism, sexism xenophobia has no limits > Red Indians NEVER ever use this term again. Especially if you are in or planning to visit Europe or N. America. At best you will be dismissed as a third world ignorant fool. At worst you will be charged as racist bigot. Hypocrisy. Many of these people are raised with massively inflated egos and thought to be believe they are better than others Exactly. He deserves his punishment F that. Leave him there. There are enough racists in our country. Don’t need to bring back someone that’s left This story is beyond hilarious.. if it weren’t so sad. Put a IIM or IIT on yourself, think they’re invincible… If America can forgive an entire sports franchise for calling themselves the Redskins then we can forgive this oblivious Redditor. Word. I absolutely love seeing arrogant people getting humbled. Gujarat/ BJP connection via ‘A’ Who made you the terminology police? If something gets the point across to people who don't usually use it in a racist way, what's troubling you? Buzz off. They have long since changed the name. *The fool who considers himself foolish, is a Wise One. The fool who is proud of his wisdom, he is said to be a fool indeed.* -Gautama Buddha bro AIPAC can claim over 95% of the people they fund will win elections but you still can't say they control everything... that's a no no lol The worst part is us Indians are racist to their own people. And that's been there for generations. It's a country obsessed with fair skin for centuries. The posters are pure israeli propaganda meant to distract from active palestinian genocide. A lot of the people turned out to have never even been missing too. Okay, but you still dont get it. Terminologies that are considered racist in a small section of a population cant be held with similar regards elsewhere. Do u have some source to prove it? India is a proper functioning society? He is an oil-analyst, probably will get a job in some Gulf countries. It was changed in 2020. Not really been long at all. Not at all… just feel priorities and seriousness of actions seems grossly misplaced Regardless this sort of behaviour shouldn't be encouraged. You can't fight evil with evil. Seems ironical in current context but totally agree People who immigrate are the ones who come from old money or are insanely skilled/talented. You won't hear much from the latter group as they are busy doing things (like those CEOs such Sunder Pichai or scientists). The former are the ones who benefitted most from social conservatism and privilege and are thus pieces of shit themselves. They do not represent India at large, but the top 1% of India. (Our population is so big, 1% would be like 14 million, that's more than 1/5th of USA population) As an Indian, I concur. He may be employable in Asia or the Gulf, but he's done in New York, at least at the level of firm that he's been working for to date. you know what would be funny? If these two clowns get sent back after this whole debacle When will we learn lmao no matter how rich you are you will always be at the bottom when you are in a white mans country I understand what you are saying, but this is a heat of the moment situation. They've probably heard americans tell them to go back to their country, and thought it was a good time to uno reverse. If you read the article, you will know that this situation arose out of their (extra passionate?) support for paslestine It is misguided no doubt. My sadness is very mild. I will only agree that zionists have deep influence. No hate for my jewish brothers and sisters who are just trying to live their lives. Its ballsy. IMO its misguided and they could have shown their support in a different way. But I appreciate the sentiment Man, alllll of the fairly recent IIMA alumni I’m meeting and hearing about are the weirdest people ever. The institute seriously needs to focus on imbibing some ethics and behaviour classes. It’s obviously a premier educational institution, but people act like graduating from there makes you omniscient and omnipotent. No offence to anyone from IIMA. Just speaking from my personal experience I would include Philipinos and other South East Asians in the list. But somehow they adore Koreans and Japanese. *1/5th of US population is 66 million. My bad! I don't know how my brain arrived at that number. I think I did USA /14 M instead of 5. More like the hard right wing conservatives who are roaming around with such inflated egos that can be busted with even the minute borderline jokes …but they once they get a open house to speak its no ends to limits Lol he should know america is ruled by the Jews. And jews are more American than anyone else. All these words but you still haven't mentioned what we were supposed to call them. Native Americans, is it? This is different to racism, unlike what New York Post would like to paint it as, his actions and the confrontation were clearly triggered by the ongoing conflict in the middle east. Many people have been tearing down Israeli hostage posters worldwide, the intense grief and helplessness has been manifesting in confrontations where people are lashing out at the the other party. This shouldn't be used to excuse genuine anti-Semitism, but there is a lot more nuance to these situations given the context. This shows how easy it is to slap a headline on a video as taken out of context it can be passed off as a completely different story. go back to your country. you 1st I mean if they don't have residence, then it will happen because he definitely can't find a new job after this Dude's gonna go around Chicago using the N word. Yeah that's not an extra for being a racist. Why are people being fired over such petty things? Israel is no saint anyway. First off I don't understand how people in the gen z and many millenials too are supporting Hamas as if they are freedom fighters? The propaganda on social media has worked very very well in brainwashing liberals to be in support of the people who would hunt them down for sport, and then laugh and spit at their mutilated bodies. Just goes to show how utterly stupid, and ignorant most people are. Just support whatever the fuck is trendy to support atm without bothering to even research anything. Ignorance, entitlement, laziness and a complete lack of self awareness is on full display. He has assimilated well into the culture. American Indians I guess. Bro forgot that upper caste entitlement doesn't work in the US Natives or native Americans (im American). In some areas indigenous peoples Wow, I wasn't even aware of this huge red flag. We say this in good spirits. Anyway, can you please care to enlighten us more about what is wrong with this terminology. No offence! 🙈 They are in the elite league of global left liberal, even if they choose to stay in the USA they will soon get a good position once again. Let's wait and see how their fortunes roll out. Here also they had a elite left liberal network. Clown to clown conversation He'd right though. Israel is an apartheid state that's committing genocide. He didn't do anything wrong, and this isn't racism. Of course when white people do such things they get away with it, no problem. Good old double standards and hypocrisy. Nah, we don't need humans in this world. Native Americans. Let's not continue white people's wrong labeling because they were so obsessed with finding us. Nsh, white people don't care. They will just ignore you. True. People's reactions to the genocide committed by Israel reveal what kind of person they truly are. Did you even know to read? He is Indian in visa and he said that to Jewish American. Israel is an apartheid country so you'll tell every jewish man across the world to fuck off to Israel? Why don't you spout the same shit to every muslim you find in India or in the west? To fuck off back to some islamic republic etc in middle east? Vikram sarabhai envisioned IIMA to be able to create future leader & visionaries of India instead it's giving us like of Ashneer, Sugar cosmetics and this kind idiots. The wife also basically lied and said that she was Palestinian, lol. >Of course when white people do such things they get away with it, no problem. If a white American guy got caught on camera saying that shit to an Indian or any other minority, they’d 100% lose their job, lol. His girlfriend also apparently forgot that she’s Indian and her surname is Gupta. Article makes it sound like she started pretending to be Palestinian, lol. So far as I’m aware, many native Americans prefer using the term “Indian.” I’m Indian-American, wife is Indian-Indian. Nobody’s said anything negative to my wife since we came here, and the only time I’ve ever had anyone tell me to “go back to my own country” is when I was living in India. As an Indian-American, I don’t feel like a victim, nor do I feel oppressed. Our community has its challenges—internal and external—but I’m sick of certain people pushing this narrative. I was just noticing how many divisions there are within the Indian diaspora. Religion, language, region, caste, colour, dialect, food, economic, educational… We as a people are extremely judgmental and insecure. Our first instinct is to pull the other person down. Taxes. They don't want to pay taxes. Indeed, and we find ways of drawing these lines of division if there aren't any. Indians in western countries are prime examples of the [drawbridge mentality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawbridge_mentality). It's so crazy that you'd be judged and abused by immigrants who arrived here a mere 2-3 years before you did. I had to block an Indian-origin user on a Canadian sub who abused me in DMs for \"coming here to steal their job\". My job requires French proficiency and engineering experience, the person who said that clearly was capable of neither. Holy moly. So sorry you had to go through that. It sounds awful. Clearly this person struggles with their identity and projects it onto others. Good that you blocked them What did all the beautiful wildlife of Serengeti do to you? You are supposed to say Native Americans in US and Indigenous people in Canada. Or just natives. Red Indian is offensive because they are not Indians. That's not their identity. Okay got it. And thanks to the person who down voted my question for my ignorance. 😅🤣🤦‍♂️ They didn't just tell them to go back to the country. They were ripping out posters of ppl who were kidnapped by hamas because it is propoganda in America. This ppl did nothing wrong. What's wrong with sugar cosmetics, just want to know your opinion. Yea, it's the same among Blacks in the US. You would discredit the personal accounts of so many other Indian Americans. I wouldnt. I dont understand this genz speak. What are you tring to say? IIRC, she actually did claim to be Palestinian in the video lol. She's trash. They don't. They keep their jobs, they continue discriminating against, abusing and harassing non-white people, no problem. Most of the time that's what happens. Have you researched anything at all? There are people being killed , everyday, be it Hammas or Israel, both are violent entities that should not exist. To top it all, people are organising protests to stop this conflict and their tax money is used to gift more bombs, no wonder they pissed. However does not condone stupid racism Yes people are being killed and it sucks. Netenyahu needs to be gone, yesterday! And who are you calling a racist? I'm condemning people that follow a violent political idealogy (not a race) which is being used to poison minds to support an organisation that shouldn't exist. There's enough condemnation and focus on Israel already but a shocking lack of focus on the fact that Hamas continue to fight, they continue to hide behind their own people who they clearly don't give a fuck about, and young impressionable minds(the world over) are being brainwashed to believe that they are the underdog, fighting for their people. If this is successful, it will further encourage violent, fundamentalist philosophies to infect the minds of gullible people(westerners particularly fall prey) Oh, shit. I was going to reply, and then I checked your username. I remember you. You’re the poster who’s literally *obsessed* with white people, and who talks about racism and discrimination non-stop while making racist and discriminatory judgments about non-Indian people. Opinion discarded. Most Indian-Americans I know are successful and well-integrated. But I’m sure you know better than us. There are over a million Indian-Americans. Again, you seem to want to speak to all of them. I dont. half baked 'engineers' with 1 year MSIS courses in US are finding jobs or loopholes to continue in the US after termination of H1b. This guy is an IIMA grad and will find something. However, good luck with the image hit that he took with his activity. Damn man,these people are adults their \"buddhi\" is crap No worries 😉 Now that they are unemployed, without healthcare, unable to pay EMI/rent, unable to find another job, he and his girl will come back to India by boat 🛶. I'm speaking strictly to my own experience, albeit in response to a comment predicated solely on speculative assumption. There is public condemnation of Israel as their strategy gives rise to more terrorists lol, the Israeli strategy of defending itself against terrorists. lol just lol They're literally doing what India has wanted to do - go into adversarial territory to hunt down terrorists. And the fact that they're able to do it is a good thing. We should salute them and support them. which one's the parsi? Bullshit, when you kill 100 civilians to kill 1 terrorist it's called genocide. They are not fighting Hammas, they are eliminating the population. But again, I am all for nihilism and elimination of the parasites called humans, but we should start with people like you first. Yikes! Proposing attacking a civilian like me for hating terrorism? Sounds like a terrorist. Sounds like you're a terrorist. Sorry, take my words back , you just some genocide supporting genetic junk. probably more fun to free your intestines I don't understand these people. One they are so invested in a problem that is not related to their life (these 2 are do not belong to Israel or Palestine ) On top of that they have the audacity to tell someone go back to their country when these 2 are clearly immigrant themselves. what a shame Mistry could be an occupational name for someone of Gujarati parsi descent. Racist and Xenophobic majoritarians Zionist se panga lena bhari padega Lol. Fatte chak denge aise racist ke Terrorist says what? Based Indian immigrants Extremely bad quality makeup. I bought from them once and got damaged(Dk if it was expired) stuff. Never bought from them again."
