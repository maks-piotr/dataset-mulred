        "I have watched couple of tv shows this year and some highly recommended shows are.\n\n1. Sandman (Netflix) - Fantasy\n2. Terminal List (Amazon) - Action\n3. Slow horse (Apple tv+) - Espionage\n4. Jack Ryan (Amazon) - Espionage\n5. Severance (Apple tv+) - Thriller\n6. Reacher (Amazon) - Based on the novel of the same name (You may have seen the Jack reacher movie starring tom cruise). Believe me this show is a 10 times better than the movie, great plot, great action and there is a new season in production. Must check.\n7. Bosch: Legacy (Spin-off/ Sequel) to the Bosch TV series and equally good. I highly recommend this show if you like watching police detective shows.",

        "I've been watching Mindhunter on Netflix. The cinematography, the screenplay, the acting is so beautiful, but then they didn't include John Wayne Gacy and I'm f**n angry.",
        "'Orphan: first kill' , was pretty decent..\n\n  \n\n\nAlso, \"Prey\" was really good, great prequel to \"The Predator\"",

        "So those of you who saw Jordan Peele's Nope, what do you think it was about?",
        "They're both different from BB and Breaking Bad. Still, watch them both. They're among the greatest shows ever made.",

Are you the kind of person who likes a movie because the the actor is good looking on the poster and it's enticing?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe actor is a lot better than Tom cruise and the action scenes are absolutely brilliant. If you have read the novel, you would get to know that jack reacher is actually a 6ft+ guy with heavy muscle contrary to the movie starred Tom cruise. Give it a try please.",
