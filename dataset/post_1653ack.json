Opportunity to some degree can be curtailed but then the freedom to walk, talk, dress whatever however whenever wherever because constitution!! folks start coming out of the woodwork.\nLack of consequences might be a start. I would imagine everyone gets taught not to tell lies but how effective is that? So all those just teach boys/men to be better is useless without the stick to ensure consequences. But then again the human rights, children rights because constitution!! folks will start with their spiel. \nSo doubt much can happen without 24/7 surveillance everywhere and severe consequences that everyone knows about.

        "I'll give a very unpopular opinion. I don't think Capital Punishment is correct. It's like cutting grass, without taking out it's seed/roots. \n\nNo one borns a rapist. There must be something that happened in their life that made them like that. We need to work on those issues more. We need to sit these rapists with country-class psychologists and ask them question. From as far as they can remember till the incident. There we will be able to learn what went wrong in their life, that made them do such things. \n\nIf we can work on those issues as a whole society. We won't just cut the grass by hanging someone. But we will address the main problem, and cut of the root once and for all.",

That's not my job, if you can't do a job don't apply for it. No one has forced her to become a guard. If a guard can't defend himself how's he going to gaurd others. You people can't digest the fact that she's bad at her job. No solo guard can protect themselves against multiple attackers. This isnt a movie that the hero will fight off the whole village single handedly In terms of crime I meant to say But our currency is not as strong, plus you can live for a week with 200 rupees Just shut up and save up some dignity for yourself She was literally raped by two other guards and her supervisor and you're calling HER bad at her job???? I'll give a very unpopular opinion. I don't think Capital Punishment is correct. It's like cutting grass, without taking out it's seed/roots. No one borns a rapist. There must be something that happened in their life that made them like that. We need to work on those issues more. We need to sit these rapists with country-class psychologists and ask them question. From as far as they can remember till the incident. There we will be able to learn what went wrong in their life, that made them do such things. If we can work on those issues as a whole society. We won't just cut the grass by hanging someone. But we will address the main problem, and cut of the root once and for all. My point was about rapists, not what professions are available to women. ‚Äú Agar public ko educate Kiya iss sabke baare mein, and good touch and bad touch kya hota hai, and more sex ed, then rape rates will drastically fall.‚Äù Can you elaborate how rape cases will fall drastically ? A murdered knows what he is doing is wrong but he is evil so he will do it anyway Here she was raped and murdered I‚Äôm sure they knew that and touch is wrong Rape is about power It is more like hidden desires come out, and those people have been fed by Bollywood that no means yes. So educating about this might just lay the foundation for more safety for women, if not reduce the rates"
