        "For same jobs? Eg as a teacher? (Not arguing in bad faith, just asking)",
        "Not in large corps. Most places have DEI and it's the other way around.",
        "I don't think in India anyone pays less based on gender for the same job with similar responsibilities and risks.",
        "The data doesn't care what you think",
        "I haven't read the original report by the World Economic Forum yet, so I could be wrong, but I think this looks at the overall economy. Which would mean that this is an indicator of lower participation of women in the economy and that they are less likely to have as well paying job as men.",
        "Well, the majority of our workforce are employed in the unorganised sector. There is definitely a lot of prejudice against women there.",
        "Yes. But there are 2 India's . Most redditors are part of the India where companies prefer hiring females. Even at my college I guess average female placement is better than average male placement. Extremes are captured by males.",
        "idk bro, If it's averaging includes adani ambani kinda people or other factors \n\nCuz I am literally seeing women getting preferred for A. increasing women percentage, and equal or good or better pay and increments. \n\nIt should be Job based News. \n\nIss pe toh log discrimination wagera Bolne lag jayengey. .",
        "Oh :( does this include jobs such as housemaid, labourer etc ?",
        "Have you read the report? Or any summary even?\n\nThe report does not disprove the orginal commentor. It looks at the median income of all working men vs all working women in a country. Top paying jobs have much more men, so the wage gap emerges. \n\nIt makes absolutely no mention of same jobs paying less to women. Which does not happen in medium to large companies because it would result in absolute carnage.",
        "It wouldn't. Such statistical anomalies wouldn't be added in a study like this. And corporate India, which has DEI policies, only accounts for a very small share of India's workforce.",
        "It's because women usually work lower paying jobs and lesser hours on average. \nIf they could get away with paying women less for the same work, they would hire all women.",
        "This is disgusting. Women are never compensated accurately for the work they do.",
        "I pay 60% total tax too.",
        "that's cool, though I believe it is kinda wrong or something.",
        "Reports like these must take into account Industry and Employee Experience. Then we can make a more clear image of the Gender Pay Gap.\n\nNot all Industries pay well and most industries are not even split equally among the genders. A more comprehensive look in needed to identify the factors behind the Gender Pay Gap.",
        "Mostly unorganized I would assume.",
        "Among daily wage labourers, men earn 600-800 and women earn 400-600 depending on the location of work. Usually there's a difference of 200 rs.",
        "It is mostly in the unorganized sector I think in the organized sector there is no difference .",
        "No, this report is referring to the overall average.\n\nThe claim is not that women make less than men for the same job but rather that women participation in better paying jobs is too low causing this difference.\n\nThe more important point is the comparison with other countries - India should not be in the same category as Bangladesh and Sudan given the size and growth of our economy. That is a valid improvement area for us.",
        "Read an article somewhere by a recruiting firm that even in white collar jobs, women don't negotiate as hard as men do. So it's easier to lowball them, which makes sense. No corporate is in the business of charity. They aren't going to pay someone more out of kindness and good heart, especially if one doesn't ask for it.\n\nHaven't got any credible source for it, but in my social circle, I have also seen men do more job hopping than women. In the current market, frequent switches are the only way to get a respectable hike. Staying at the same organization doesn't even beat inflation. So that could be a factor, too.",
        "BANGALESH!",
        "Women are MADE TO work lesser. Paying jobs because of men's weaponised incompetence. The number of women who had to quit work during covid and post covid because their husbands are useless fucks is wild.",
        "Just for understanding it better , doesn’t it mean that women take up low paying jobs ? \n\nIf there’s a man and women applying for a position in IT , then that women is also gona be paid same if she is selected. \n\nBut if women are applying for the job that are less paying then the one in IT ( for example) then how does that comparison makes sense ?",
        "On average single/unmarried women thrive in their workplace and grow pretty well because they often are more skilled. It's women who are kept back when they're married off or have kids because most Desi men are deadbeat husbands and fathers. \n\nWhich is why they end up being able to take promotions, work more hours as they don't contribute jackshit at home beyond their salary that they lord over everyone. \n\nYes, despite having maids and cooks, there's still housework to do, esp if there's kids involved. And this is more rampant in unorganised sector - people also want to pay maids less and bargain and mostly women who work for less. As most \"janitorial\" jobs in companies are occupied by men. Not to mention the positions as drivers and all (often because it involves working during night hours). \n\nFor example - I make 4k less than my male counterparts at my work. Why? Because I HAVE to take the office cab facility if I don't have my own vehicle due to safety concerns, it's not negotiable. While the men can take an auto and not pay for the cab service after shift (which ends at 10pm) and hence earn that 4k more - while the monthly expense for me from that is about 2k if I didn't have to go by office cabs.",
        "I don’t think so. In my experience, the woman will be offered less.",
        "I am not sure why you are being downvoted. You are spot on. \n\nAlso i would add that it’s definitely an indication of low participation but also the comparison of two jobs that pays 100 ( man ) and 40 ( woman ) is wrong. \n\nif they are the same job then it’s indeed a discrimination but if they are different like 100 is for software engineer and 40 is for Fashion Designer then the comparison is flawed",
        "Then that’s definitely the discrimination",
        "Absolutely. It’s vile.",
        "##OP:\ntell me a single job where they r paid less for same job?\n\ninfact its not the era of verbal job agreements.\n##everything is on paper and the salaries are predefined irrespective of gender.\n\ninfact we can hear more preference being given to women in corporate jobs.\n\nthe only exception i can think of is unorganised daily labourer job...but do u think the output given by a man is same as a woman..in a job which requires physical strentgh?\n\nand why to say it about all jobs....just on data of one sector?",
        "arey bhai statistics saamne hain, how can you believe otherwise lol",
        "It's because of having children, women's earnings takes a hit but men's doesn't because women are expected to do all the childcare so they can't work late or more demanding jobs because they have to take care of children.",
        "biased and irrelevant withou any proof view",
        "they have to pay for auto though?\n\nsome states have got free buses for women...\n\nand its not discrimination based on gender ..nobody is forving anyone based on gender to take the cab service or not...\nthere is no discrimination based on gender..\n\nits ur chouce",
        "It kind of does happen here and there. My sister used to work in a small firm that had all female employees. They were paid like 20-25K a month and it was like a white collar formal job , like everyone there had husband/father taking care of all the financial needs and working only for the sake of working. No insurance or benefits, only the salary.",
        "Hi, You make the same as your male employees. 4K is deducted from your salary, the actual amount remains the same.",
        "LOL\n\nActually yes. It's mandatory for women to take office cabs because of safety issues and liability. \n\nAnd I already mentioned the difference in cost of office cab vs auto even if they're paying for it \n\nAnd this is a nuanced example of how the actions of men cause bad consequences for women en masse. And hence it is not discrimination based on gender. It's oppression of one gender because of the oppression gender. \n\nIt's NOT a choice when the consequences are literally safety issues. 🙄",
        "Women pick fields that are less taxing on them and as a result they get paid less.",
        "That deduction accounts for loss in salary that males don't have. Does it not? 🙄",
        "arey didi, Main 3 firms main kaam kar chuka hun, and bhai aur bhi doston se baat kiya hai. \n\nBased on that. \n\nAb sirf final data present kiye hai idhar, Same like Exit polls.\n\nIf you are working - Do you see such a vast difference in pay scale for the same job role, Be honest? \n\nDon't say Aamir khan and Virat kohli get's High, The reasons are fan base, Ye fan base wale jobs chod k normal bolo bhai. \n\nI can believe there is a difference (tbh i have only observed - equally low pay or equally good pay for the same work profile)",
        "Coz lot of women don't work or they are forced to stop working after kids....",
        "Yeah why see what's in front of your eyes.\n\nStatistics literally proved worldwide that single women are the happiest and married men are the happiest demographic. I'm sure it has nothing to do with married men enslaving women to do all the unpaid work at home. 🙄",
        "I have a great boss. ***She*** makes 40% more than me!",
        ">Cuz I am literally seeing women getting preferred for A. increasing women percentage,\n\n'Increasing women percentage' should tell you that it is _dominated_ by men. Which means the preference is for men and they'll only hire enough women to appear diverse then go back to hiring men.\n\nA friend of mine was one of three women (out of over 100 employees) in a branch of a multinational bank. The sexism and casual harrasment was off the charts. People kept calling them 'diversity hires' even though each of them were top performers.",
        "Women in our workforce has been decreasing over the last few decades, as India becomes richer. This maybe bad for our economy but is largely seen as a cultural thing. For eg it's largely seen as why should the wife work if the husband can singlely provide for the family as opposed to say Bangladesh (one of the highest female workforce in the region) where more than one provider is needed to support a family.",
        "imagine a girl who comes to work late never does her work properly always tries to skip time at work chatting or doing some shitty stuff while a man who somes to work in time can't say everyday does his work properly and in time helps his coworkers so who would u give bonus or increase salary",
        "You know we are a single species, rt?",
        "the amount of folks ITT arguing against the main issue highlighted in this repot - and those folks who are willfully skewing the conversation with low effort arguments like DEI, \"more women being hired / promoted\" etc. is incredible. \n\nway too many bad faith actors & downright idiots involved. no wonder the pay gap is so wide & progress is so limited.",
        "If companies could get same work done and pay less to women, why don't they hire all women?",
        "Without DEI some people wouldn't hire women at all (regardless of their performance). With DEI most industries are still absolutely dominated by men. So many friends I know worked in companies where the percentage of women was so low, there would be like 1-3 out of 100. \n\nAnd people kept implying they only got in because of diversity even though they were top performers. Casual harrasment is also pretty accepted. Like technically there's HR, but reporting will just get you targetted and ostracized and things that would get you fired in a developed country are majorly downplayed here.",
        "Managers aren't always logical. Most men managers just hate women and low caste people in offices so they prefer hiring high caste men instead of low caste or women with the same qualification.",
        "Lol not in my office!!!!!!",
        "Do you? Cause one gender doesn't seem to treat the other as such 🙄",
        "Indeed! People don't get that data don't care about their feelings.",
        "You are wrong. I know female doctors who are paid less than male doctors in the private sector despite having the same duties and responsibilities. Just because you have not seen in does not mean it is not happening.",
        "If you have worked in a professional environment with women, you would understand",
        "In IT you have to negotiate, most people don't negotiate.",
        "Statistics like these are selectively taken to show a different picture.",
        "Anecdotal evidence is only evidence of an anecdote. Isiliye we rely on statistics rather than \"Mai 3 forms mei kaam kar chuka hun\". Kitne forms hai India mei, and kitno mei kaam Kiya hai?",
        "No. Same qualification and experience for my first job. I got  30k while the guy got 38k.\n\n\nThis was after negotiating too!\n\n\nSince then everywhere I have asked, the difference has been 5-6k min. \n\n\nPlease do a survey in your team or company. Keep it anonymous you will get a better and honest result.",
        "Sorry for the difference, But When a good opportunity from Amazing firm says : Women Candidates preferred, it kinda hurts, allow us(low scale company job) to be hurt cuz we also want that kinda Good Pay Good Company job and we are already Cancelled cuz Women candidates preferred even for the Resume Stage. \n\nand Top Performers in Education means nothing, Top Performance on Job means Much (personal opinion which all are entitled too)",
        "But the aunties of the society wouldn't accept househusbands. I would be very happy to marry a woman who earns 12 LPA+. I would quit my job and do all the house work and look after the child.",
        "Men and women are similar with regards to aggression although men tilt a little bit more towards aggression so that if you picked a random person out of the population male and female and you guess that male more aggressive you'd be right 60% of time but if you take the 1 in 100 most aggressive people, they 're all male and that's why overwhelming proportion  of people who born in prisons are male. now do you want to equalize that? just out of curiosity , what about bricklayers? they are 99% male and we got about three quarters of the population now in the universities in the humanities and social sciences are female, are we going to equalize that? men work more longer hours, they work more dangerous jobs, they are more likely to move, they are more likely to work outside, they are more likely to participate in the jobs in the stem fields that are scalable , they make more money for those reasons and thats all hidden under the idea that the reason men and women make different amounts of money because of their gender.",
        "firms,\n\"and I have heard from friends\"\n\nAlso I have Asked bro - If you all are working, Comment is there a difference in your pay as per Job role! ??\n\nand bhai - there is a difference which needs to be attended, (Jo maine likha hai, but sirf ek phrase pe logon ko chidna hai) but it's hard to believe that Difference is this much....\n\nAll I want to say is.\n\n****The difference is possibly less or even non existential, In many firms or most firms, In pay scale, For the same opportunity****",
        "Bullshit , if that's true I will hire all females for paying less than half of what I pay men , but that's not true it's impossible do u guys even understand a women being paid 40k and the man being paid 1l for the same job? Where is this happening, there is surely some word play involved here.",
        "When it comes to small jobs like receptionist at a small office, or help in xerox shops, women are preferred over men, where I'm from since men demand more salary. Hell, my dad's been considering hiring a woman instead as draftman for him over his current guy since female ones are less expensive. Women can't  even demand the same salary in cases like this since our society prefers men so they will be like \"I'll just hire a man instead with that money\"",
        "Bhai if even government surveys show that there's a difference, it means difference bahut hai. Ye incel waala thought ki women are being given unfair preference is not true.\n\nHell, in India, women are the majority in doing low paid hazardous jobs. Women make up the majority of sewer cleaners in India.",
        "3/100 is incredibly skewed. And their performance shouldn't matter either way",
        "Negotiations come after the fact. Women are offered less to begin with.",
        "Managers are there to make more money for the company. If there is a manager does what you mentioned , they'll soon be replaced by someone who can bring in more money.\n\nInfact I've noticed the opposite , managers prefer hiring pretty girls over men who are really fit to do the job.",
        "I might be ignorant and less informed while saying this but personally, I have seen more and more women willing to be employed for jobs in various fields. In fact, people are getting more supportive for women working equally to men.  \n\n\ncan you provide source for your comment?",
        ">Most men managers just hate women and low caste people in offices so they prefer hiring high caste men instead of low caste or women with the same qualification.\n\nvictim card to win a argument, no logic i see. \n\nAnd also you justifying that cheating isn't bad thing shows what type of immoral narcissistic person are you [https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1d4581x/i\\_dont\\_think\\_adultery\\_or\\_cheating\\_is\\_a\\_bad\\_thing/](https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1d4581x/i_dont_think_adultery_or_cheating_is_a_bad_thing/)",
        "This is exceptionally dense. 'Women prefered' because literally everyone is male. 'Men prefered' doesn't even need to be said because that is the default - men are _always_ prefered. That is why they dominate the work place. It's not even a 50-50 split in high-earning industries. It's _overwhelmingly_ male. And I'm not even talking about higher up the ladder. \n\nSome people would literally not hire women unless they're forced to (regardless of their qualifications), and even when they're forced to will only hire the bare minimum. \n\nAnd obviously I'm talking about their performance at work. The fact that you're sceptical that a woman can be a top performer is part of the problem. The fact that people think by default women can't be as capable as men at mental tasks is the problem.",
        "Most jobs dont disclose the pay, you have say how much you want and they will tell how much they can offer. Negotiations already started when you told them your number.",
        "The title is ridiculous. It makes it seem like the report is about gender pay gap when it has absolutely nothing to do with that.\n\nThey are not comparing salaries here. They are comparing opportunities. Women earn less because they have fewer opportunities.",
        "Like you want to be hired under DEI, but not be told it is DEI?",
        "Lower paid small jobs definitely pay men more than women. All these receptionist being mostly women has to do with the fact that they can be paid less than the men.\n\nNot to mention female labourers who work aside men are paid less that these men. I don't think efficiency is whats paying them less.\n\nWhat you said only applies to stipulated salaried jobs not with jobs where pay is decided based in \"market value\".",
        "Exactly. I only mentioned their performance because they literally had to be the best of the best to get in (a much higher standard than the male candidates) and even then they got treated as less than. So often, when a woman gets promoted, people start making unsavoury comments, which rarely happens with men. \n\nThe work culture is incredibly toxic for women and there are people still whinging about 'preferential treatment' even though the opposite is evident - even at first glance - in most high-earning industries.",
        "Useless statistic.\n\nThis does not mention if they earn this much for the same jobs.",
        "lol, \n\nsorry, Which line of Mine says - WOMEN can not be a top performer? \nwow? matlab ? wtf? like what the hell? \n\n\nThe way you all Take it as - \"This guy is saying Women are capable and all, which I haven't said and also Don't suppot but Y'all only have to find negative and put up a defense or something\". Is that a Need ? \n\nI am just saying why reject even at the resume stage. \n\nThe internal politics, Yeah needs to be attended.",
        "I found the original report; no, it includes only the organised sector (which discredits labourers, wet nurses, housemaids, etc.).\nHowever, there is a report by World Bank that does the same especially for the unorganised sector. I'm gonna try and find it, if I do, I'll link it here.",
        "If your office forced you to wear a new tie everyday (for better customer experience xd) and took 4000 from your salalry for it then its ok? how about 8000?",
        "So your point is what? Most women dont work 'properly'? Any research to backup your claim? coz there is loads against it.",
        "Talking about the wage gap, yours is a more unique example. Since it's not a salary discrimination per se, but office policies on transportation causing a minus in your final take home.\n\nIf your're forced to travel by cab, then you're forced to pay that 4K cab expense, that's obviously not fair. Say if a woman earns 8K, spending half your salary on transport is unrealistic right? I'm not aware of the specifics of your situation, but this is why I don't think the rule will hold up.",
        "There's no way to measure that officially, I think. It's completely unorganised.",
        "They do. In fact, most people don't want to hire women for blue collar work because nobody wants to he responsible for her safety (not referring to death). ",
        "Men demand higher pay while women dont. In many cases in the city, women work for their pocket change. So they don't even demand.",
        "The comments I'm replying to are tiresome and \n\nSome are just straight up reading half, assumptions there are..\n\n\nStill No One is answering my simple question - \n\nDO YOU ALL, around you, See \"such differences in pay scale as depicted in the post\" for the same job role, same opportunity, same work level?",
        "Do you have any data of women participation is decreasing ? Companies are hiring more women then they were few years ago via diversity quota",

        "That's certainly praise-worthy in this example, and those male candidates need to learn a lesson or two. I can imagine the whole drama about 'preferential treatment' put out by rejected guys, I'm just wondering if that's always (mostly) a fictitious concept and being male or female doesn't factor in at all.",
        "Nope, even for same job they are offered less.\n\nI dont remember, but many applications were placed with same CVs except, person applied was changed like gender. Which found women are offered less. \n\nI dont remember who conducted that but i read that few years back",
        "So essentially what is being said is the cumulative total earned by women is 40% vs that of men.\n\nThis data would be meaningful if one could also share % of women working vs that of men. \n\nIf the number is close to 40% then it is only a question of getting more women to work and nothing to do with payment parity",
        "And what's your experience?",
        "The percentage of participation part is understood by how do you assume women are less likely to have well paying jobs vs men, what's the data point for that",
        "Yep. Most women dominated jobs such as nursing, teaching etc are low paying. A lot of folks here can't think beyond what's happening in their little cubicle of their corporate office.",

        "This is not true that men do more work there - I mean, its arguable. I am a researcher who looks at women's labour and construction workers, for instance, women are given the most gruelling tasks - like transferring rocks and such. Even middle-men say that we can't give semi-skilled work to women. Sometimes women will run a creche or a kitchen for the workers on the premises, which I would not say is \"less\" or \"easier\" work. It is considered less work, that is another matter. But to understand what work it is, you have to talk to these women and hear about the kind of occupational hazards they face - which the men also do, btw.",
        "You are absolutely on the right track. This is an overall comparison, It's not like for like. This is an attempt to create disharmony by pushing the gender pay gap agenda. A large proportion of women take low paying jobs. This is similar to the report saying 70% of indian youth between 18-24 are unemployed and very conveniently hiding the fact that in india most of the youth go for higher education and advanced degrees. \n\nHaving said that , historically there was a difference and there may be some instances of private employers still differentiating between women and men in terms of pay.especially the jobs that involve physical labour. \n\nI don't know if india has any laws against the gender discrimination in terms of pay,  but if they don't, the government should definitely introduce one.",

The woman, if she decides to be a mother, will likely miss a promotion cycle because her paid leave period will not work towards that. Also, since men get stupidly less leaves during child birth and rearing (like my company which gives 6 days leave, like wtf), women will not be able to give as much priority to work after child birth as well. These things affect pay a lot.\n\nThen there is the education issue. There are way fewer women in streams with high paying work opportunities (like civil engineering). Some streams were even blocked from women until very recently (like mining engineering). This somewhat also stems from the same patriarchal \"protect women\" mindset.\n\nAlso there is the social problem that men want to marry women earning less than them and women look for higher paid spouses.

While a man is paid ₹383 a day on an average, a woman makes a mere ₹294 a day. The gap in their daily wages is more than the cost of two kilograms of rice. \n\n\n> **This gap differs from State to State.** Field labourers, for instance, make the most money in Kerala. While a man gets ₹789 per day, a woman is paid ₹537. While this is the highest amount paid to a woman labourer in a State, it is also ₹252 lesser than what her male counterpart was paid. As of 2020-21, Tamil Nadu has the highest gender page gap among agriculture field labourers at 112 per cent. It is followed by Goa (61 per cent) and Kerala. The wage gap is the lowest in Jharkhand and Gujarat (6 per cent each), but the women labourers there get paid just ₹239 and ₹247 per day, respectively. \n\n.\n\n> Salaried Class: In the one-year period between July 2022 and June 2023, an average salaried Indian male made ₹20,666 in a month. A woman, on the other hand, made ₹15,722.25. Among the salaried class, the wage gap was the highest in Odisha (68 per cent), followed by Jharkhand (67 per cent) and Gujarat (62 per cent). Gujarat is also the State where an average salaried woman earned the lowest salary — ₹1,0419 per month. \n\n> At the same time, a report by the Pew Research Centre cited most women being treated differently by employers as a major reason for the pay gap. “Smaller shares point to women making different choices about how to balance work and family (42%) and working in jobs that pay less (34%),” it added.\n\n> Senior roles: “Women, who are part of key management personnel, are paid roughly half the amount of their male counterparts,” noted the report, adding: “Some practitioners suggested that women might be overrepresented in company secretary roles, which are typically paid lower than other KMP. Even so, these low numbers overstate the actual experience because the number of data points is so small. Of the 112 companies that provided a breakdown of KMP remuneration by gender, 77 companies (69 per cent) had no women KMP at all.” \n\n> https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/data-stories/data-focus/in-india-women-struggle-with-pay-gap-across-sectors/article67457643.ece",

Then we have agriculture, where while womrn are working, they are typically not getting  paid and they are not employees but are working on the family farms. This is what is leading to these discrepancies.\n\nOn a side note, a major reason why these reports are not reliable is because they are too consumer centric i.e. they rarely take into account people working in the unorganised sector and self employed people such as farmers. Typically in these industries, the gender pay gap is minimal (except for infrastructure and unorganised mining, where it is a serious problem) but these studies don't take that in account.",

        "I completely agree and do feel that women soils be self sufficient and independent, but allow me to explain why it’s a thing from a societal perspective. \n\nIf someone is from a poor economic background, then both genders have to work, and if someone breaks the chain, which is normally a man, one of the first things that happens is that woman can not work which is seen as a luxury.  \n\nIn middle to class households, this carries on but has the worst impact because house help can housework and with the lack of productive work to do in or outside the house, it impacts the health and mental wellness and even can be very suffocating.\n\nIn upper middle class houses(not first gen), women are more likely to work because the family was already educated and so the importance was stressed upon early on. And more liberal thoughts mean That independence takes precedence. \n\nAnd finally In the affluent households, women likely act as socialites and handle the social aspect of the family which is an equally essential function. And those that want to work take up faux roles with zero pressure like columnist for a magazine or something in entertainment or art. \n\nNow my own mom works but even so my parents would prefer that my partner assume a socialite-like role. And I get where they are coming from despite the fact that I’d prefer someone who is working. Just one partner being free and handling the social aspect when the other gets next to no time to do that is a huge thing, esp when you have children and stuff eventually. And eventually being a parent is a full time job and since husbands are usually very busy, being with the kids is important for their development and growth. May sound sexist of me, but if it comes to it, I wouldn’t mind taking up parenting.",

        "So, what's your overall point? Because in your first comment, you wanted to refute my claim that men work more than women in construction. I don't see the paper answering this question.\n\n\nIf you were saying that it's difficult to prove that men work more than women in construction, I mean it depends on how you assign difficulty to different tasks. \n\n\nIf you simply look at the same task, it's not difficult to prove at all. Either way, we don't have to scientifically prove something to believe it. Our experience formed by multitude of data points can arrive at the solution. We do this every day. For example, people believe from their experience that trying to not lose their attention on the text while studying for exam is more efficient than not trying to focus. We don't read scientific proofs for this to decide if we have to focus or not.\n\n\nThis is just one example. Our entire day is filled with decisions we take only from data from experience and not from scientific proofs. It would be ideal if we could prove it scientifically, but it's not feasible to do studies for every small thing.\n\n\nOverall, my point is that, in construction, it is easy to see that men work more than women. If you really want to know the answer, you can simply visit a construction site when they're building a new slab. Then you'll know exactly what tasks men and women undertake. You can talk to them about it. I'm simply saying from experience as my father is in construction, I see them work everyday.\n\n\nGood day.",

    "light_cleaned_comments": "For same jobs? Eg as a teacher? (Not arguing in bad faith, just asking) Not in large corps. Most places have DEI and it's the other way around. I don't think in India anyone pays less based on gender for the same job with similar responsibilities and risks. The data doesn't care what you think I haven't read the original report by the World Economic Forum yet, so I could be wrong, but I think this looks at the overall economy. Which would mean that this is an indicator of lower participation of women in the economy and that they are less likely to have as well paying job as men. Well, the majority of our workforce are employed in the unorganised sector. There is definitely a lot of prejudice against women there. Yes. But there are 2 India's . Most redditors are part of the India where companies prefer hiring females. Even at my college I guess average female placement is better than average male placement. Extremes are captured by males. idk bro, If it's averaging includes adani ambani kinda people or other factors Cuz I am literally seeing women getting preferred for A. increasing women percentage, and equal or good or better pay and increments. It should be Job based News. Iss pe toh log discrimination wagera Bolne lag jayengey. . Oh :( does this include jobs such as housemaid, labourer etc ? Have you read the report? Or any summary even? The report does not disprove the orginal commentor. It looks at the median income of all working men vs all working women in a country. Top paying jobs have much more men, so the wage gap emerges. It makes absolutely no mention of same jobs paying less to women. Which does not happen in medium to large companies because it would result in absolute carnage. It wouldn't. Such statistical anomalies wouldn't be added in a study like this. And corporate India, which has DEI policies, only accounts for a very small share of India's workforce. It's because women usually work lower paying jobs and lesser hours on average. If they could get away with paying women less for the same work, they would hire all women. This is disgusting. Women are never compensated accurately for the work they do. I pay 60% total tax too. that's cool, though I believe it is kinda wrong or something. Reports like these must take into account Industry and Employee Experience. Then we can make a more clear image of the Gender Pay Gap. Not all Industries pay well and most industries are not even split equally among the genders. A more comprehensive look in needed to identify the factors behind the Gender Pay Gap. Mostly unorganized I would assume. Among daily wage labourers, men earn 600-800 and women earn 400-600 depending on the location of work. Usually there's a difference of 200 rs. It is mostly in the unorganized sector I think in the organized sector there is no difference . No, this report is referring to the overall average. The claim is not that women make less than men for the same job but rather that women participation in better paying jobs is too low causing this difference. The more important point is the comparison with other countries - India should not be in the same category as Bangladesh and Sudan given the size and growth of our economy. That is a valid improvement area for us. Read an article somewhere by a recruiting firm that even in white collar jobs, women don't negotiate as hard as men do. So it's easier to lowball them, which makes sense. No corporate is in the business of charity. They aren't going to pay someone more out of kindness and good heart, especially if one doesn't ask for it. Haven't got any credible source for it, but in my social circle, I have also seen men do more job hopping than women. In the current market, frequent switches are the only way to get a respectable hike. Staying at the same organization doesn't even beat inflation. So that could be a factor, too. BANGALESH! Women are MADE TO work lesser. Paying jobs because of men's weaponised incompetence. The number of women who had to quit work during covid and post covid because their husbands are useless fucks is wild. Just for understanding it better , doesn’t it mean that women take up low paying jobs ? If there’s a man and women applying for a position in IT , then that women is also gona be paid same if she is selected. But if women are applying for the job that are less paying then the one in IT ( for example) then how does that comparison makes sense ? On average single/unmarried women thrive in their workplace and grow pretty well because they often are more skilled. It's women who are kept back when they're married off or have kids because most Desi men are deadbeat husbands and fathers. Which is why they end up being able to take promotions, work more hours as they don't contribute jackshit at home beyond their salary that they lord over everyone. Yes, despite having maids and cooks, there's still housework to do, esp if there's kids involved. And this is more rampant in unorganised sector - people also want to pay maids less and bargain and mostly women who work for less. As most \"janitorial\" jobs in companies are occupied by men. Not to mention the positions as drivers and all (often because it involves working during night hours). For example - I make 4k less than my male counterparts at my work. Why? Because I HAVE to take the office cab facility if I don't have my own vehicle due to safety concerns, it's not negotiable. While the men can take an auto and not pay for the cab service after shift (which ends at 10pm) and hence earn that 4k more - while the monthly expense for me from that is about 2k if I didn't have to go by office cabs. I don’t think so. In my experience, the woman will be offered less. I am not sure why you are being downvoted. You are spot on. Also i would add that it’s definitely an indication of low participation but also the comparison of two jobs that pays 100 ( man ) and 40 ( woman ) is wrong. if they are the same job then it’s indeed a discrimination but if they are different like 100 is for software engineer and 40 is for Fashion Designer then the comparison is flawed Then that’s definitely the discrimination Absolutely. It’s vile. ##OP: tell me a single job where they r paid less for same job? infact its not the era of verbal job agreements. ##everything is on paper and the salaries are predefined irrespective of gender. infact we can hear more preference being given to women in corporate jobs. the only exception i can think of is unorganised daily labourer job...but do u think the output given by a man is same as a woman..in a job which requires physical strentgh? and why to say it about all jobs....just on data of one sector? arey bhai statistics saamne hain, how can you believe otherwise lol It's because of having children, women's earnings takes a hit but men's doesn't because women are expected to do all the childcare so they can't work late or more demanding jobs because they have to take care of children. biased and irrelevant withou any proof view they have to pay for auto though? some states have got free buses for women... and its not discrimination based on gender ..nobody is forving anyone based on gender to take the cab service or not... there is no discrimination based on gender.. its ur chouce It kind of does happen here and there. My sister used to work in a small firm that had all female employees. They were paid like 20-25K a month and it was like a white collar formal job , like everyone there had husband/father taking care of all the financial needs and working only for the sake of working. No insurance or benefits, only the salary. Hi, You make the same as your male employees. 4K is deducted from your salary, the actual amount remains the same. LOL Actually yes. It's mandatory for women to take office cabs because of safety issues and liability. And I already mentioned the difference in cost of office cab vs auto even if they're paying for it And this is a nuanced example of how the actions of men cause bad consequences for women en masse. And hence it is not discrimination based on gender. It's oppression of one gender because of the oppression gender. It's NOT a choice when the consequences are literally safety issues. 🙄 Women pick fields that are less taxing on them and as a result they get paid less. That deduction accounts for loss in salary that males don't have. Does it not? 🙄 arey didi, Main 3 firms main kaam kar chuka hun, and bhai aur bhi doston se baat kiya hai. Based on that. Ab sirf final data present kiye hai idhar, Same like Exit polls. If you are working - Do you see such a vast difference in pay scale for the same job role, Be honest? Don't say Aamir khan and Virat kohli get's High, The reasons are fan base, Ye fan base wale jobs chod k normal bolo bhai. I can believe there is a difference (tbh i have only observed - equally low pay or equally good pay for the same work profile) Coz lot of women don't work or they are forced to stop working after kids.... Yeah why see what's in front of your eyes. Statistics literally proved worldwide that single women are the happiest and married men are the happiest demographic. I'm sure it has nothing to do with married men enslaving women to do all the unpaid work at home. 🙄 I have a great boss. ***She*** makes 40% more than me! >Cuz I am literally seeing women getting preferred for A. increasing women percentage, 'Increasing women percentage' should tell you that it is _dominated_ by men. Which means the preference is for men and they'll only hire enough women to appear diverse then go back to hiring men. A friend of mine was one of three women (out of over 100 employees) in a branch of a multinational bank. The sexism and casual harrasment was off the charts. People kept calling them 'diversity hires' even though each of them were top performers. Women in our workforce has been decreasing over the last few decades, as India becomes richer. This maybe bad for our economy but is largely seen as a cultural thing. For eg it's largely seen as why should the wife work if the husband can singlely provide for the family as opposed to say Bangladesh (one of the highest female workforce in the region) where more than one provider is needed to support a family. imagine a girl who comes to work late never does her work properly always tries to skip time at work chatting or doing some shitty stuff while a man who somes to work in time can't say everyday does his work properly and in time helps his coworkers so who would u give bonus or increase salary You know we are a single species, rt? the amount of folks ITT arguing against the main issue highlighted in this repot - and those folks who are willfully skewing the conversation with low effort arguments like DEI, \"more women being hired / promoted\" etc. is incredible. way too many bad faith actors & downright idiots involved. no wonder the pay gap is so wide & progress is so limited. If companies could get same work done and pay less to women, why don't they hire all women? Without DEI some people wouldn't hire women at all (regardless of their performance). With DEI most industries are still absolutely dominated by men. So many friends I know worked in companies where the percentage of women was so low, there would be like 1-3 out of 100. And people kept implying they only got in because of diversity even though they were top performers. Casual harrasment is also pretty accepted. Like technically there's HR, but reporting will just get you targetted and ostracized and things that would get you fired in a developed country are majorly downplayed here. Managers aren't always logical. Most men managers just hate women and low caste people in offices so they prefer hiring high caste men instead of low caste or women with the same qualification. Lol not in my office!!!!!! Do you? Cause one gender doesn't seem to treat the other as such 🙄 Indeed! People don't get that data don't care about their feelings. You are wrong. I know female doctors who are paid less than male doctors in the private sector despite having the same duties and responsibilities. Just because you have not seen in does not mean it is not happening. If you have worked in a professional environment with women, you would understand In IT you have to negotiate, most people don't negotiate. Statistics like these are selectively taken to show a different picture. Anecdotal evidence is only evidence of an anecdote. Isiliye we rely on statistics rather than \"Mai 3 forms mei kaam kar chuka hun\". Kitne forms hai India mei, and kitno mei kaam Kiya hai? No. Same qualification and experience for my first job. I got 30k while the guy got 38k. This was after negotiating too! Since then everywhere I have asked, the difference has been 5-6k min. Please do a survey in your team or company. Keep it anonymous you will get a better and honest result. Sorry for the difference, But When a good opportunity from Amazing firm says : Women Candidates preferred, it kinda hurts, allow us(low scale company job) to be hurt cuz we also want that kinda Good Pay Good Company job and we are already Cancelled cuz Women candidates preferred even for the Resume Stage. and Top Performers in Education means nothing, Top Performance on Job means Much (personal opinion which all are entitled too) But the aunties of the society wouldn't accept househusbands. I would be very happy to marry a woman who earns 12 LPA+. I would quit my job and do all the house work and look after the child. Men and women are similar with regards to aggression although men tilt a little bit more towards aggression so that if you picked a random person out of the population male and female and you guess that male more aggressive you'd be right 60% of time but if you take the 1 in 100 most aggressive people, they 're all male and that's why overwhelming proportion of people who born in prisons are male. now do you want to equalize that? just out of curiosity , what about bricklayers? they are 99% male and we got about three quarters of the population now in the universities in the humanities and social sciences are female, are we going to equalize that? men work more longer hours, they work more dangerous jobs, they are more likely to move, they are more likely to work outside, they are more likely to participate in the jobs in the stem fields that are scalable , they make more money for those reasons and thats all hidden under the idea that the reason men and women make different amounts of money because of their gender. firms, \"and I have heard from friends\" Also I have Asked bro - If you all are working, Comment is there a difference in your pay as per Job role! ?? and bhai - there is a difference which needs to be attended, (Jo maine likha hai, but sirf ek phrase pe logon ko chidna hai) but it's hard to believe that Difference is this much.... All I want to say is. ****The difference is possibly less or even non existential, In many firms or most firms, In pay scale, For the same opportunity**** Bullshit , if that's true I will hire all females for paying less than half of what I pay men , but that's not true it's impossible do u guys even understand a women being paid 40k and the man being paid 1l for the same job? Where is this happening, there is surely some word play involved here. When it comes to small jobs like receptionist at a small office, or help in xerox shops, women are preferred over men, where I'm from since men demand more salary. Hell, my dad's been considering hiring a woman instead as draftman for him over his current guy since female ones are less expensive. Women can't even demand the same salary in cases like this since our society prefers men so they will be like \"I'll just hire a man instead with that money\" Bhai if even government surveys show that there's a difference, it means difference bahut hai. Ye incel waala thought ki women are being given unfair preference is not true. Hell, in India, women are the majority in doing low paid hazardous jobs. Women make up the majority of sewer cleaners in India. 3/100 is incredibly skewed. And their performance shouldn't matter either way Negotiations come after the fact. Women are offered less to begin with. Managers are there to make more money for the company. If there is a manager does what you mentioned , they'll soon be replaced by someone who can bring in more money. Infact I've noticed the opposite , managers prefer hiring pretty girls over men who are really fit to do the job. I might be ignorant and less informed while saying this but personally, I have seen more and more women willing to be employed for jobs in various fields. In fact, people are getting more supportive for women working equally to men. can you provide source for your comment? >Most men managers just hate women and low caste people in offices so they prefer hiring high caste men instead of low caste or women with the same qualification. victim card to win a argument, no logic i see. And also you justifying that cheating isn't bad thing shows what type of immoral narcissistic person are you [https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1d4581x/i\\_dont\\_think\\_adultery\\_or\\_cheating\\_is\\_a\\_bad\\_thing/](https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1d4581x/i_dont_think_adultery_or_cheating_is_a_bad_thing/) This is exceptionally dense. 'Women prefered' because literally everyone is male. 'Men prefered' doesn't even need to be said because that is the default - men are _always_ prefered. That is why they dominate the work place. It's not even a 50-50 split in high-earning industries. It's _overwhelmingly_ male. And I'm not even talking about higher up the ladder. Some people would literally not hire women unless they're forced to (regardless of their qualifications), and even when they're forced to will only hire the bare minimum. And obviously I'm talking about their performance at work. The fact that you're sceptical that a woman can be a top performer is part of the problem. The fact that people think by default women can't be as capable as men at mental tasks is the problem. Most jobs dont disclose the pay, you have say how much you want and they will tell how much they can offer. Negotiations already started when you told them your number. The title is ridiculous. It makes it seem like the report is about gender pay gap when it has absolutely nothing to do with that. They are not comparing salaries here. They are comparing opportunities. Women earn less because they have fewer opportunities. Like you want to be hired under DEI, but not be told it is DEI? Lower paid small jobs definitely pay men more than women. All these receptionist being mostly women has to do with the fact that they can be paid less than the men. Not to mention female labourers who work aside men are paid less that these men. I don't think efficiency is whats paying them less. What you said only applies to stipulated salaried jobs not with jobs where pay is decided based in \"market value\". Exactly. I only mentioned their performance because they literally had to be the best of the best to get in (a much higher standard than the male candidates) and even then they got treated as less than. So often, when a woman gets promoted, people start making unsavoury comments, which rarely happens with men. The work culture is incredibly toxic for women and there are people still whinging about 'preferential treatment' even though the opposite is evident - even at first glance - in most high-earning industries. Useless statistic. This does not mention if they earn this much for the same jobs. lol, sorry, Which line of Mine says - WOMEN can not be a top performer? wow? matlab ? wtf? like what the hell? The way you all Take it as - \"This guy is saying Women are capable and all, which I haven't said and also Don't suppot but Y'all only have to find negative and put up a defense or something\". Is that a Need ? I am just saying why reject even at the resume stage. The internal politics, Yeah needs to be attended. I found the original report; no, it includes only the organised sector (which discredits labourers, wet nurses, housemaids, etc.). However, there is a report by World Bank that does the same especially for the unorganised sector. I'm gonna try and find it, if I do, I'll link it here. If your office forced you to wear a new tie everyday (for better customer experience xd) and took 4000 from your salalry for it then its ok? how about 8000? So your point is what? Most women dont work 'properly'? Any research to backup your claim? coz there is loads against it. Talking about the wage gap, yours is a more unique example. Since it's not a salary discrimination per se, but office policies on transportation causing a minus in your final take home. If your're forced to travel by cab, then you're forced to pay that 4K cab expense, that's obviously not fair. Say if a woman earns 8K, spending half your salary on transport is unrealistic right? I'm not aware of the specifics of your situation, but this is why I don't think the rule will hold up. There's no way to measure that officially, I think. It's completely unorganised. They do. In fact, most people don't want to hire women for blue collar work because nobody wants to he responsible for her safety (not referring to death). Men demand higher pay while women dont. In many cases in the city, women work for their pocket change. So they don't even demand. The comments I'm replying to are tiresome and Some are just straight up reading half, assumptions there are.. Still No One is answering my simple question - DO YOU ALL, around you, See \"such differences in pay scale as depicted in the post\" for the same job role, same opportunity, same work level? Do you have any data of women participation is decreasing ? Companies are hiring more women then they were few years ago via diversity quota For what jobs? lmao. such a bad and biased take. data doesn't lie but people surely know how to twist it to fit their narrative It's is true...take the case of the private health sector women earn very less than males, women dominated fields like nursing is paid peanuts and I've even seen female doctors given less for same work. Tell me you are a member of r/TwoXIndia without telling me you are a member of r/TwoXIndia That's certainly praise-worthy in this example, and those male candidates need to learn a lesson or two. I can imagine the whole drama about 'preferential treatment' put out by rejected guys, I'm just wondering if that's always (mostly) a fictitious concept and being male or female doesn't factor in at all. Nope, even for same job they are offered less. I dont remember, but many applications were placed with same CVs except, person applied was changed like gender. Which found women are offered less. I dont remember who conducted that but i read that few years back So essentially what is being said is the cumulative total earned by women is 40% vs that of men. This data would be meaningful if one could also share % of women working vs that of men. If the number is close to 40% then it is only a question of getting more women to work and nothing to do with payment parity And what's your experience? The percentage of participation part is understood by how do you assume women are less likely to have well paying jobs vs men, what's the data point for that Yep. Most women dominated jobs such as nursing, teaching etc are low paying. A lot of folks here can't think beyond what's happening in their little cubicle of their corporate office. This is exactly what I was thinking when I read the article. /u/spoojy_neko_bird Can you provide a source for that or is it just your perception? A simple google search would actually take you to the survey. Instead of expecting to be spoonfed everything, how about take 30 seconds to check on Google before shooting your keyboard off on reddit? and out of 60 he spent on his kids and home utilities and what left with him is... 😶 Team of 100, sector IT. Women are paid more than men for the same job Granted there are fewer women viz a vi men in the team (about 70 / 30 >DO YOU ALL, ArounD you, See \"such differences in pay scale as depicted in the post\" for the same job role, same opportunity, SAME work level? This is not supposed to be an anecdotal report though. No it doesn't, it factors in a benefit (cab + security) that you get for a cost (4k) Use your own transport, you won't have to take the office cab. Also to preempt the whole womens lack of safety is men's fault in general, no it isn't, it is a societal issue and last i checked asca percentage of population women make up 48% of the population of the country. Abey not this again Awwww the not all men argument and yet it's men who endanger women's safety. And are directly or indirectly responsible. India is a traditional country where most women don't do jobs. This is expected. Post this in r/twoxindiA It is pandering to dei if all recruitment opportunities are the same, but less women apply or make it through. You are then trying to ensure equality of outcome and not of opportunity, the focus should be in equality of opportunity and not of outcome. And if you want to focus on equality of outcome to address inqualties why only focus on gender as a factor? What about financial inqualties where the gulf is much more, why not do drives to hire people from financially underprivileged backgrounds irrespective of gender This cultural thing is also a problem - that why should women work when husband can provide. Husbands don't always provide and the unequal earning status automatically puts women at a lower status in the family, she get less say in important matters. I am not implying you are saying its okay, just pointing out that this cultural thing is also very sexist. For these calculations, median wages are used, so it doesn't have to do with female labour force participation at all. Hope that helps. We pay 30 percent in taxes, and then women take 40 percent, leaving men with only 30 percent of their earnings. That's simply unfair. This is not true that men do more work there - I mean, its arguable. I am a researcher who looks at women's labour and construction workers, for instance, women are given the most gruelling tasks - like transferring rocks and such. Even middle-men say that we can't give semi-skilled work to women. Sometimes women will run a creche or a kitchen for the workers on the premises, which I would not say is \"less\" or \"easier\" work. It is considered less work, that is another matter. But to understand what work it is, you have to talk to these women and hear about the kind of occupational hazards they face - which the men also do, btw. You are absolutely on the right track. This is an overall comparison, It's not like for like. This is an attempt to create disharmony by pushing the gender pay gap agenda. A large proportion of women take low paying jobs. This is similar to the report saying 70% of indian youth between 18-24 are unemployed and very conveniently hiding the fact that in india most of the youth go for higher education and advanced degrees. Having said that , historically there was a difference and there may be some instances of private employers still differentiating between women and men in terms of pay.especially the jobs that involve physical labour. I don't know if india has any laws against the gender discrimination in terms of pay, but if they don't, the government should definitely introduce one. To be fair, that is also gender pay gap. Gender pay gap does not always imply that its about the same job or something along those lines. \"When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression.\" That is true but think in terms of lower class people who were forced to work in order to survive for eg your maid, cook etc etc. Would they still work if they have an option of stable income at home? Now middle class and upper class women may or may not work depending on their personal choice but some people don't have that choice What you think doesn't change reality. \"When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression.\" This thread is a great example of why India is no country for women. This looks like a very uni dimensional chart. I am not refuting the pay disparity comment but how will you understand the parameters? is it the job type/industry/skilled or unskilled labor/ industry/experience? we cant just keep swallowing whatever is said. data can be interpreted in multiple ways I completely support women in the work force and if they choose to work they absolutely should buy some women especially the poor are forced to work for eg a maid, a cook, daily labourers. As families get richer they drop out of the work force Lol so a long winded way of saying \"I have no credible sources and this is just my perception\" Awwwwwh the i want equality but only selectively because true equality would shatter my precious view of the world isn't even related and even my mindset but well, I also know People will support your comment and I also Know the reason why 😂.... , \"When asked to fact check, Naah it is what it is, even if wrong or even right, you need to check you mindset, you are wronggg\" They are not including women who are not in the labour force. It is a comparison of working men's earnings with working women's earnings. Someone is considered unemployed only if they are looking for a job but not able to find it. Someone in higher education is not considered unemployed. Stop defending an inept government. still not answering my question 🐥 still not answering my question 🐥 Not this shit again.. Yes that's what I am saying but that's not what the report claimed. I am not defending the government. I am just pointing out the trend. The metric is flawed. It needs to be something like, earnings by hours worked. If you disregard hours, less hours worked will skew the metric against women. However if hours worked are considered and they're less overall, we don't have a problem. No that's absolutely correct - its a good question you ask. Can you ask the same question about lower-class men? Would they work if they have the option of stable income at home? She literally has mentioned that office makes it compulsory to use their transport for women without their own car while men doesn't have this stipulation. Read better. I did this with group size = 5 (2 girls, 3 guys), all in a similar age group and similar experience levels. The result was that women were slightly better paid for their experience levels than the guys. They were both the top earners in the group, with the top girl earning around 25% more than the top guy, and 35% more than the bottom guy. One of the girls was in fact, the bottom performer of the team. Note: I do not claim that they were better paid because of gender, I think it's a circumstantial difference. Four of them switched the jobs (everyone except the bottom guy). The two guys ended up very close, just 10% difference between them. Both the girls got over 50% higher pay than both the guys. I've observed the same for many people at many varying experience levels. Of course this doesn't paint the whole picture, just like your experience doesn't, but any employment which has any kind of standardization is pretty much the same. What fact check? The report is in front of you, and you are still saying this. Maybe look at the report? These are media wages, so Adani Ambani and all won't matter here. This is an overall average and represents a lack of opportunities for women than data for specific jobs. Basically it means that women in India have lesser job opportunities and even the jobs that they get are lower paying in general compared to men. I don't know what report is claiming 70%, but more than 45% unemployment in the youth, which it was recently in India, is already one of the world's highest unemployment rates. And this means those who are looking for jobs. Read [here](https://www.livemint.com/economy/indias-youth-unemployment-rate-among-highest-in-world-says-ex-cea-netizens-call-it-heights-of-propaganda-11716977982254.html). Well in that case, the hours worked by men and women should be adjusted for the household work done by both. If men are generally able to work more hours, its only because they generally have lesser household work to do compared to women due to patriarchal expectations. A large proportion of women take low paying jobs - you mean like for fun? Here is the statement: \"Why should the woman need to to work IF the man can single handedly provide? Then here is what you said: Husbands don't always provide. Well, that is why the \"if\" is there in the first place. If the husband, for whatever reason, is not providing enough for the family, then the woman can and should work to maintain a decent standard of living. However, she should have the option to stay home and manage it if the earning of the guy is sufficient. She can still choose to work if she is passionate about her career. I agree with what you said about unequal earning status putting women at a lower status in homes. It doesn't make any sense.... my dad would be NOTHING if my mother wasn't home handling shit. Women who are home-makers deserve a lot of respect and admiration. Unfortunately our society is dumb. So yeah, the practical thing for women to do is earn money to get some respect. I hope this will improve with time though. There is no reason to judge the non-earning member of a household as the lesser person, no matter who it is. You make the argument, you provide the source to back it up. Don't expect to change anyone's mind/opinion if you can't do that. Awww someone demands equal responsibility in exchange for equality because they don't understand the nuances that to take equal responsibility, there must be equality first. Else it's just exploitation and oppression 🙄 Hmmm, you turned it around to say that I am judging homemakers. Nope. But society does. Your father might be nothing without your mother, but I bet she doesn't get the same respect in the world that your dad does. That is just how it is. I have seen it first hand. Everyone should obviously have the option to do whatever they want - work or no work. Including men. But women make that choice often, and men often don't. That is the context of the world we live in. This same culture also pushes men into skilled jobs, women into lower skilled, lower paying jobs. This culture also encourages men to educate themselves and focus on that from a young age, but women are asked to prepare for married life and skills required for that. It starts early. If you cannot admit that this is an issue of gender, I don't know what to say. Did I ask you to change your mind? Noone expects misogynistic men to change their minds. Lol. Then the simple answer would be to stop working jobs like teaching and nursing. Men work hard their whole lives to earn and reach where they are only to be let down by women like you who won’t even acknowledge the fact these surveys are total crap and do not represent actual reality. You could argue anything you want but the reality as it stands today is men have it worse. I clearly agree that it is a gender issue. I also agree women need to work to gain respect in the society. Also I didn't turn anything around you. I AM blaming society for judging homemakers harshly. I won't be replying to you anymore because you are coming at me with a tone that suggests you wanna pick a fight and I am not into that. Ciao. But then it wouldn't catch as many eyes, would it? I can't find the methodology used by them, are they even taking into account employed vs unemployed? and where's the oppression, I am just saying the difference is high, It's literally saying For Any Job - for the same Role, Men are paid 1 lakh and Women just 40k. And It is simply theoretically and Practically Not applicable to All Jobs. How Hard is this to understand? 😂🐥 Women make 1,00,00,000 for every 0rs a man earns frm divorce Can you elaborate? Are you a recruiter? This looks like it was just written to spark a controversy. Making stats look like \"look women, you're being paid less than men\", not taking into account the industry, experience, work deliverables, etc. Huge for the corporate sector, me and my former teammate had same level of experience she got a better pay because it was her second job and she could negotiate. We then both switched at the same time and she got over 50% better offer than me thanks to her ability to negotiate. But what will that inference bring to the table? We are discussing pay disparity in the workforce, not the pay disparity in the workforce because of household chores. It’s just the workforce. I agree with most of your premise but disagree with the last point. You aren't making less here, you're buying an additional facility. If I'm disabled and have to spend 10k per month in meds, physiotherapy and doctor, then it doesn't mean that I'm being paid 10k less, just that I was unfortunate to be born with it. It's not a pay discrimination based on my condition. However, a major mnc which ghosted me the moment I tell them about it during recruitment is indeed a discrimination. Thank you!! If op is a man then he isn't even allowed to post there I am sorry that just comes across as verbal diarrhoea. WTF does equal responsibility in exchange for equality even mean? Certain types of Equality (e g oppertunity, pay parity for the same job, etc) should be a given, and not in exchange for anything Responsibility though can never be equal, as it will always be the best suited/ most relevant person for the job. If there is a financial fraud in your company, everyone should be equally responsible. Most likely no, the most relevant and people will be held responsible If hard labour is required in the house, say lifting heavy objects and moving furniture around etc. is everyone's equally responsible? No, it will be male adults whose primary responsibility it will be to get that shit done. Then adults in general and finally kids if they can lend a hand. Empty numbers without context or parameters mean nothing. Does this take into account non-working people? A massive number of women are working part time (2-6 hours), so even if the comparison was only for working people it still isn't even. It does show that women are on average financially dependent on men, but nothing more nothing less. I think a better comparison would be to consider only people under 40, for example. Again, it's not saying that. It's not saying that for the same role, this happens. Read the article. Let's assume they took only employed people. Now well paying Industries such as Petrochem, Pharmaceuticals, IT, Logistics are very very male dominated while low paying one such as Education, Marketing & Sales, Architecture have high female participation or female dominated. Only two fields, Medicine and Finance, that are high paying and also boast a significant female participation. Also, all of this date in the report is definitely just the organised sector, which is like maybe a 25% to 33% of the total jobs in India. We have absolutely no idea about the unorganised sector, so its likely to be even worse if not equal. okay yeah On an average it says, Buy isn't that a wrong comparison?! when most firms have HR policies for equal pay... Just because you don't see the discrimination and lack of opportunities doesn't mean that they don't exist. Data doesn't lie. ‎ Didnt they have a day where men were allowed to post? >Let's assume they took only employed people Any source for that? >Also, all of this date in the report is definitely just the organised sector, Any source for that? Bangladesh is way higher than India, does their organized sector have many women in high paying jobs? Again, I understand and accept there could be the existence of said discrimination and Lack of opportunities, But buddy, The difference is being averaged out, and it could be easily Misinterpreted and used. The difference in PAYSCALE for the same level and type of job is non existential where HR policies are defined. To put the data in context. Man , it's about skill , choices, education. Historically indian workforce has mostly been made up of men. Men more often do tend to take jobs away from home and in remote areas. These jobs pay well compared to local ones. As I said I am not talking about same jobs , there is no one who has a wife , mother or daughter they love can ever advocate for pay disparity when both are doing the same job Expected it . Make horrendous claims . Get asked for a source. Calls the Men Misogynistic for that. Checks out as a typical 2xIndia Member. The gender pay gap should still report it as a problem. Why are women getting into less paying jobs more than men? You will find out that it is a cultural problem, very much related to patriarchal structure (the husband must be the one slaving away for the family type mentality while many women will feel proud of \"not needing to work\"). My point is that it is a metric to measure the ill-effect of patriarchy and it does that perfectly. IMO, the portion of this resulting from inequal pay in same jobs will be rather small (as that will be blatant sexism and most organisations have systems in place to avoid that). It isnt sufficient to stop the analysis at - women pick lower paying jobs. That needs to be looked at further and addressed. >Any source for that? I said assume, I didn't state any fact. >Any source for that? Tell me how are you going to gather data about the unorganised sector that is purely cash run, no papers or id involved, and does not adhere to any government regulation apart from maybe the minimum wages. >Bangladesh is way higher than India, does their organized sector have many women in high paying jobs? They have high women participation in the textile industry. Obviously its all sweat shops, but still a proper job with a salary. >Just for understanding it better , doesn’t it mean that women take up low paying jobs ? To a decent extent, it does. That is the biggest cause of gender pay gap worldwide. However, that too arises from the ill effects of patriarchy on the society. >If there’s a man and women applying for a position in IT , then that women is also gona be paid same if she is selected. Yes, but then there are several other problems as well. The woman, if she decides to be a mother, will likely miss a promotion cycle because her paid leave period will not work towards that. Also, since men get stupidly less leaves during child birth and rearing (like my company which gives 6 days leave, like wtf), women will not be able to give as much priority to work after child birth as well. These things affect pay a lot. Then there is the education issue. There are way fewer women in streams with high paying work opportunities (like civil engineering). Some streams were even blocked from women until very recently (like mining engineering). This somewhat also stems from the same patriarchal \"protect women\" mindset. Also there is the social problem that men want to marry women earning less than them and women look for higher paid spouses. This impact the way men and women grow up and choose professions. I am not denying any of this. Also most companies are not MNCs, and HR can and will be arm twisted into giving bloated salary figures of women employees to authorities. Not saying its common place but its still very very possible There is that problem too (along with more important \"women take up lesser paying jobs more\"). \"I can hire a guy at that price\" is a common sentiment in MSME sector. > as India becomes richer. Except most of India hasn't actually become richer. Wages have stagnated to all hell. Then why hire men? If you can hire women for less, just hire only women. Your profits will soar and share price will shoot up like Adani on June 3rd. what 🙄 It’s true women do make less money than men But it’s their fault because they choose the lower paying jobs. Men, for example, choose the higher paying jobs like doctor or lawyer. Whereas women choose the lower paying jobs like women doctor and women lawyer. I don't know about all that - but this report is talking about difference in median wages, not average wages. So women simply do jobs that are less paid, this is NOT about women getting paid less for the same job - although that happens widely as well. HR policies are not always followed and not all places have a robust HR. I know its hard to believe, but google \"women construction workers India\" and there is a lot of info about that. There is this news report that is very interesting: [https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalNews/videos/677165706742829/](https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalNews/videos/677165706742829/) Another interesting report on women construction workers: [https://gold.uclg.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/ch8\\_prospering\\_44.pdf](https://gold.uclg.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/ch8_prospering_44.pdf) Apparently the percentage of women construction workers is reported to be different so there are no good numbers but yea, its an understudied area. Absolutely, more investment is needed in women education and safety, and laws needed to protect their interests . Without that this disparity would not change. \" I don't know about all that - but \" Mujhe wo sab nahin pata, Is report main aisa likha hai toh hai 🫥. Bro again, I understand and accept there are differences in pay scale in many firms, But It is pretty evident most jobs are equal pay. Median also doesn't help, The Data need to atleast \"Highlight\" in which \"field of work\" there are many differences... otherwise the Data is not helpful, Each company is just gonna say we pay equal 🫥 Man why even bother to post the bullshit here? That incompetent organisation keeps pushing useless statistics like this and you're posting it here. Ya, this was my exact same question ... I think the report is showing a population level difference. The women's average is dragged down because many women choose to remain Stay At Home Mothers and there is no economic value attached to this unfortunately ... Oh my god you are not getting it at all and you are talking so rudely. I am genuinely trying to explain to you what this data is. See, this is not about one company paying different salaries to men and women. So stop saying company will say. This is some information about the world and there are no clear solutions to it. The data is saying that women, on the whole, are in jobs that PAY LESS. So as a very simple example, more women are nurses than doctors for example, therefore they will earn less than men. The data is NOT saying that a hospital is paying less to women doctors than male doctors. This is not about a company or a field of work, this is about an entire country's culture of women having LESS power to earn compared to men. The reasons might be many, low education, discrimination, etc. That is the next step. Spot on ! That’s the most apt observation. This means that Gender Gap is the not issue , it’s the consequence of a bigger issue ( patriarchy ). Society as a whole is not very encouraging for women’s education and the career choices , so as a result the choice pool is very limited. That is why the women workforce partition is very low. Also usually people increase their salaries by switching to a new job , that might not that easy for women who are already struggling to manager the family and current job. It’s sad that we look at the end picture and say “ oh why don’t they go for higher paying job “ and shrug it off like it’s not a problem in itself 😞 A relevant documentary on women participation in India.

Tech, MNCs. Thank you for providing a source with some context behind the data. Just saw a post above this post claiming women use their father's as ATM and then publicly mock them as well. The irony. I think few privileged women see privileged women around them and forget that these are not all the women in the world. Tech and finance (investment banking especially) are industries where they are actively trying to retain women employees because they are hardly present, especially in more senior positions. This could explain the parity/higher salary you have observed. In male dominated industries like IT and Banking, there is a genuine push to retain employees which could explain this, but these are exceptions, not the norm. > A report by the CFA Institute, released in March 2023, showed that the pay gap widens as women move higher up in the career ladder.

The gap in their daily wages is more than the cost of two kilograms of rice. > **This gap differs from State to State.** Field labourers, for instance, make the most money in Kerala. While a man gets ₹789 per day, a woman is paid ₹537. While this is the highest amount paid to a woman labourer in a State, it is also ₹252 lesser than what her male counterpart was paid. As of 2020-21, Tamil Nadu has the highest gender page gap among agriculture field labourers at 112 per cent. It is followed by Goa (61 per cent) and Kerala.

Even so, these low numbers overstate the actual experience because the number of data points is so small. Of the 112 companies that provided a breakdown of KMP remuneration by gender, 77 companies (69 per cent) had no women KMP at all.” > In most building constructions what I saw, men had to work 25% more. Take the simple instance of transferring the sand and rocks into the machine that converts it into concrete. Men put the sand in their lifting vessel and lift it over their head on their own and walk to the machine and deposit it there. Women on the other hand don't lift the vessel on their own, men (who already lift their vessels) help women lift it onto their heads before they do it themselves. This lifting is clearly extra work. If you consider on the pouring of concrete on the slab itself, it's the men who push the huge tank of concrete and pour it there. More extra work. Yea anecdotally you might be right, but reality is much more complicated than \"men do more work\". That's all. You can refer to the study I've linked. I'm done here. It’s not about what employer is paying, it’s about how much women negotiate. They tend to negotiate less and settle for lower offer than men. This is a problem worldwide and not just in India. Very few women are able to negotiate or sell with the confidence of a man. If I have to dumb down the reason - it’s the conditioning of being a good girl and not fighting for what they deserve. damn someone teach me statistics to understand all these surveys I mean if men and women do roughly equal work and if you can pay women less, why would anyone employ men for tasks that can be done by women It's obvious because women dont work the same jobs as men nor the same hours. I wish it was that simple. The assumption is that women cannot do certain tasks (semi skilled). And anyway, this supply side rationale doesn't work in the real world where modes of hiring are very localised. I'd urge you to read the study I have linked above. It will give a better picture of what happens around construction sites. Okay will do I think its true for high school teachers. Men are def paid more It also says that \"It needs to improve by 6% to reach 2012 level\". Seems like it gotten worse over the year. Kangana Ranaut, MP: I don't care because I earn Rs. 100,000 for every Rs. 100 earned by an average Indian male. Nirmala Sitharaman, FM: I don't know anything about that because I earn Rs. 10,000 for every Rs. 100 earned by an average Indian male. Would it be legal to pay 2 teachers with same exact duties different wages? And are there laws against it? Holy shit, this should be a post itself. Thank you Someone has replied with an article that shows men and women doing the exact same jobs aren't paid the same either. It's true I've seen in many fields people pay very less to women The employment of women is predominantly in the organised services sector. We still have a deficiency in women employment in the manufacturing sector and the unorganised Sector. Then we have agriculture, where while womrn are working, they are typically not getting paid and they are not employees but are working on the family farms. This is what is leading to these discrepancies. On a side note, a major reason why these reports are not reliable is because they are too consumer centric i.e. they rarely take into account people working in the unorganised sector and self employed people such as farmers. Typically in these industries, the gender pay gap is minimal (except for infrastructure and unorganised mining, where it is a serious problem) but these studies don't take that in account. Feminism ruined demography and family structure. Earlier 1 income was enough. Now even 2 are less and then no one to raise kids. Women earn way more in the new \"divorce business\" and with super high return, women doing this business has skyrocketed in recent times. Everyday I wake up to some bullshit on my phone. Women on only fans make 100k while men barely have any chance . Tell more >Deduction in Salary Salary is still the same , is it not ? Opt out of the office cab system and there won't be any deductions. Do you want the office to pay 4K a month out of their pockets to pick up and drop her every workday? this makes me very sad :( Deserved for the work they put in Gtfo misinformation It gets less in affluent circles. My own family(and that’s despite the fact that my mum works) would prefer if my partner(when it’s time for that like 5-10y down the line) not work and be more like a socialite and take a faux job of sorts like a columnist for a magazine or something. Obv even being a social bee is as much of a full time ‘job’, but when one person can support the household, the other taking up the social role makes more sense. For less affluent but well off circles it’s like if the husband can afford to take care of the family, the wife takes care of children and runs house errands and stuff which in itself is a full time job too, which more often than not falls on the wife’s shoulders even if she’s working. It’s not ideal but just the way it is. False data. Not true entirely. In fact, for the same work and time, women are paid more. (Corporate sector). Let's not talk about the fashion industry. idk about india but in some african countries, in artisanal mining, ppl are paid on the amount of stuff they mine and not a flat payment because that ends up being more profitable, and since men on average are physically more powerful and can spend more time in the mines, it would make sense that there’s a gender pay gap. YAAAY pakistan se aage hai lekin YAAAY I completely agree and do feel that women soils be self sufficient and independent, but allow me to explain why it’s a thing from a societal perspective. If someone is from a poor economic background, then both genders have to work, and if someone breaks the chain, which is normally a man, one of the first things that happens is that woman can not work which is seen as a luxury. In middle to class households, this carries on but has the worst impact because house help can housework and with the lack of productive work to do in or outside the house, it impacts the health and mental wellness and even can be very suffocating. In upper middle class houses(not first gen), women are more likely to work because the family was already educated and so the importance was stressed upon early on. And more liberal thoughts mean That independence takes precedence. And finally In the affluent households, women likely act as socialites and handle the social aspect of the family which is an equally essential function. And those that want to work take up faux roles with zero pressure like columnist for a magazine or something in entertainment or art. Now my own mom works but even so my parents would prefer that my partner assume a socialite-like role. And I get where they are coming from despite the fact that I’d prefer someone who is working. Just one partner being free and handling the social aspect when the other gets next to no time to do that is a huge thing, esp when you have children and stuff eventually. And eventually being a parent is a full time job and since husbands are usually very busy, being with the kids is important for their development and growth. May sound sexist of me, but if it comes to it, I wouldn’t mind taking up parenting. Tldr? this might be true but i doubt it explains the large disparity of 40% Nah. That is because of lot many factor. For same position, in india in high end jobs or formal sector would be little less. May be <10 idk. But also, we shouldn't forget instead of paying equal which is required by law, they may just reject female candidates. Which is also common practice. In informal it's a lot. I'll try to give a tldr tomorrow if you're genuinely interested, but there's a lot of nuance on the report. You can just skim through it real quick. “Female ones” Wdym men do more work in construction, you never saw women carry stuff on their head? It's usually women who do that > I think few privileged women see privileged women around them and forget that these are not all the women in the world. Classic Nora Fatehi My bad I meant men ! Goddammit. People are earning? Any link/source for your claim? no this report doesn't take jobs nor working hours in account,for example in their calculations a guy working 10 hours is same as a woman working 5 hours for these rankings My father works in construction, so i see them everyday, so I know from experience. Please take a look at my other comment where I explained how men do 25% more work. This is simply in construction. I don't know about how things are in other daily wage jobs. I skimmed through the paper and it seems like the paper is talking about the hazards and difficulties faced by women in the field. I don't see any statistics showing women doing equal amount of work as men in construction. I don't how why you shared it as proof of women and men doing same amount of work. Which country is Bangalesh? No Need to read how the calculated this but it seems participation in workforce is a factor. Obviously we have very low participation because of stigma and patriarchal society. I wasnt sharing it as men and women doing equal amounts of work - that would be so difficult to operationalise! So, what's your overall point? Because in your first comment, you wanted to refute my claim that men work more than women in construction. I don't see the paper answering this question. If you were saying that it's difficult to prove that men work more than women in construction, I mean it depends on how you assign difficulty to different tasks. If you simply look at the same task, it's not difficult to prove at all. Either way, we don't have to scientifically prove something to believe it. Our experience formed by multitude of data points can arrive at the solution. We do this every day. For example, people believe from their experience that trying to not lose their attention on the text while studying for exam is more efficient than not trying to focus. We don't read scientific proofs for this to decide if we have to focus or not. This is just one example. Our entire day is filled with decisions we take only from data from experience and not from scientific proofs. It would be ideal if we could prove it scientifically, but it's not feasible to do studies for every small thing. Overall, my point is that, in construction, it is easy to see that men work more than women. If you really want to know the answer, you can simply visit a construction site when they're building a new slab. Then you'll know exactly what tasks men and women undertake. You can talk to them about it. I'm simply saying from experience as my father is in construction, I see them work everyday. Good day. Cool, believe what feels right to you, and I will do the same :) Good day. Its true...its because of less participation in high paying jobs. I am from Himachal and Kangana is our second female MP (I hate that woman) but the fact that she is our second says a lot about female representation. Actually, they earn less in low paying jobs as well. There are a lot of farmers that are women. You will see them working in worse condition (carrying a baby while they are barefeet and carrying bricks). There's a lot of disguised unemployment as well...especially for female farmers Kangana is the second female MP...second...in 2024 tells enough about female participation in a place where women have one of the best literacy rates in the country It's not a gender pay gap for the same jobs It's okay I would say. I know plenty of single women who said they only marry wealthy men, but guys don't really care about the wealth of the woman. If these groups expect women to earn as much as men, then aforesaid kind of archaic mindsets should be changed, otherwise you have a society where there are a large number of single men and women struggling to find a partner. Men can be harmed too, kidnapped, harassed, robbed, attacked, and nobody cares."
