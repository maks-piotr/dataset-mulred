    "selftext": "I was booking flight ticket on Yatra for my upcoming travel, and noticed that the convenience fee increases if you apply credit card based coupon codes.  \nUpon applying a credit card coupon code, the convenience fee increases from 399 to 499.  \nDue to this our \"effective\" discount reduces, as Yatra eats up a pie from the discount offered by the bank by increasing the convenience fee.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tixfkiqlre9c1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98bd35f7fa6e9e8731a3f1ab5a7e6dc8697fe081\n\n![img](sj5y4mqlre9c1 \"\n\")\n\n People need to be cautious & alert about such sneaky charges added by these platforms on the final payment page, as additional increase can be more if companies are not called out for such shady practices.\n\nIf anyone has similar experiences of shady practices, plz do share.",
