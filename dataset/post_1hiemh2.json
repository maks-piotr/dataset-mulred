        "Bangladesh increased the holidays by 8 more days. 3 more days off for Puja and 5 more days off for Eid.\n\nSo, that's a total of 33 days off.",
        "Indian working system has work and no life. Infact, when I was working in India, they paid sh*t, on top of that, no to low holidays. You cannot take a saturday or sunday off since it will be bridge and hence it will become unpaid holiday. Indian working system is a joke!",
        "I live in a European country known for its good work life balance. I get 26 leave days and 8 public holidays a year.\n\nThere's a lot more to work life balance than just public holidays.",
        "While ur busy finding temples under mosques or something \n\nThe so called global superpower 2020 has banned work life balance lol",
        "Japan is going do introduce a 4 day week . I know it is to boost population but still . Japan was the only country that was working more than us but not anymore. Japanese genz is not not listening to their boss' illogical demands anymore and the culture of drinking with colleagues ( nomikai ) is also dying. In 7-8 years their work life balance will be same as western Europe.",

        "Like fr bruh, why isn't the government making new temples. Don't they have the craftsmen or the land. These people are so desperate. I agree, it's true during many conquests, temples have fallen, and so did mosques and Buddhist temples. \n\nWhy destroy the present day buildings instead of making new ones. Unless, there's some specific reason, like the ram mandir had that it was the birth place of Ram.",
        "You must mention that you don't really 'ask' for leaves, at least in my experience. It is more of me informing that I will be taking time off instead of having to negotiate like I had to with Indian bosses.",
        "The problem is in Indian work culture people who bootlick get priority. Now when these people come on higher positions, they really don‚Äôt have skills, ability or charisma to work at that position. So just being available at all times becomes their productivity. Now once they do it they expect their subordinates to do so too. Thus the cycle continues without any empathy & improvement.\n\nAnother problem is that we Indians lack empathy. So in many people the tendency is that of something bad has happened to me it should happen to others too. For example, if at workplace boss shits on me, than when someone else comes with that problem; instead of handling it compassionately the answer given is, ‚ÄúI got shit upon, everyone gets shit upon you too should bear it‚Äù. This ultimately translates to, I have to work late & thus you should too. The problem is the people advocating this mostly have higher pay scale & higher position. They expect the same from subordinates who earn probably 1/4th their salary & are 2-3 levels down the hierarchy.\n\nI worked in an org whose VP at that time was a dick on both of these points. One of the Project Managers was a really good person. She would make her team members leave for home if their work was done. If mandatory 8 hours were not done for that day, she would ask them to chill around. It was noticed by this VP, he made her life hell. Goving her work beyond her role just to make her work 24x7. Adding her to meetings across timezones. Many of us saw her crying in corner many times. But least we could do was just be with her. She is now a bigshot in one of India‚Äôs top company. One of the great person I have worked with.\n\nIn another case, a new project required a new server setup. A lead who was supposed to set it, spent 48 hours straight to make it running. It wasn‚Äôt even his project, but still did it. Now when it was all done, he went to VP and told him he is going home. VP was like Why? What if something comes up? Lead was like I haven‚Äôt seen much family for 2 days. Kids are asking for me. VP was like, ‚ÄúI get divorce threats from my wife every week, nothing happens. Chill‚Äù.\n\nThat VP is nowadays trying to be a LinkedIn Influencer.",

        "So practical experience i have had \n\n- india tends to officially start wokeing at 9.30 but actual working starts at 10.30 / 11.30 \n\n- indian bureaucracy is slow as hell . For reasons i dont understand like we dont automate because we need to give employment but also leave vacancy on so many positions \nAlso the positions that are filled have power trips and comes in the form of come to my office and wait for me for a couple of hours this is expected of the md . If the md doesnt do this you wont get certain approvals \n\n- officially work ends at 6 but unofficially people start preparing at 5.30 \n\n- outside office issues like traffic waste alot of peoples time that they could spend living a life \n\n- noise pollution,  bad roads , road rage and lack of civic sense lead to lowered quality of life \n\n- some employers are predatory and stockhome syndrome sets in . Leading to exploitation.  \n\n- low pay , living beyong our means ( this feels like a recent development) going into debt causes most people to work in places that they shouldnt be working .\n\nSome recommendations \n\nIf you management is good , then support them . Dont think of it as an opportunity to screw over your boss \n\nIf you start at 9.30 then start at 9.30 and if your done at 4 dont sit around till 7 to show you you've been working late . \n\nKnow what adds value . Do what adds value . Inform your management that you added xyz value \n\nVote for politicians who build good road , schools , hospitals and create a safe society literally your right \n\nIf a boss is toxis be in a position to say fuck you and leave . Cant emphasise how important it is for employers to have employees that add value and expect the fair pay in return .\n\nBe clear with your expectations if the management is clear with theirs . ( if your management isnt clear about it thats a red flag ) \n\nTake everything in writing and give everything in writing . ( email)",

Being able to take the leaves you have, and being able to shut off work and live your life beyond working hours is what makes good work life balance. Next to no boundaries on working hours wouldn't be compensated by a couple of extra public holidays a year"
