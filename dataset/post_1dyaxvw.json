        "Well it's not new it's an daily occurrence",
        "Post-elections these terrorist attacks have increased, seems like the separatists didn't like the relatively high voting turnout in J&K and their handlers are now being desperate.",
        "Fuck these terrorists. It breaks my heart when I read the stories of martyrs and their families 💔",
        "When will this madness end...so many young and old give the Supreme sacrifice and we seem to be ok by giving some cash and a medal to the family. We are not sensitive and worried about so many families loosing their sons or daughters. \n\nPray some sanity prevails soon and all these lives are saved going forward. Just putting out my thoughts and prayers for love and peace in our country and the world. God bless.",
        "Also Surprisingly these are happening in jammu instead of kashmir. Maybe the security is top notch in kashmir now, have to do the same in jammu too.",
        "Is there a link between failure of cpec and again amping up of terrorism by pakistan? Maybe while cpec was going on china wanted stability in the region for its development.",
        "Numerous houses are being searched by military and police. Many of the citizens were hiding terrorists in their own house. \n\nTerrorism wont end till we got snakes in our gardens. \n\nhttps://x.com/adityarajkaul/status/1810007092998381787?s=46\n\nUAPA needs to be imposed every house should be searched for guns and ammo in the region.

        "Reports election se phle pta chalgai thi around 100 terrorist border cross kiye h",
        "Some people within the state support these terrorists. They help them smuggle weapons and let them stay at their homes for 'money'. Ashamed to live in the same state as these immoral sons of bitches. God damn these traitors",

        "Let's go over what's been happening in this area \n\nIn 2021 a RR unit was moved out of rajouri poonch area to LAC on Chinese front since this was a relatively calm area. But this created a gap in the security which led to multiple infiltrations & these infiltrations were not done by random Jihadists but rather well trained terrorists some of whom are clearly ex pak army guys including SF. \n\nThis alongside failure of BSF in detecting a few tunnel network resulted in a large group operating in smaller groups in this area. This is not proper Kashmir but rather away from it. \n\nSo what has happened after that since 2021 India has lost 50 soldiers to ambushes on unarmoured vehicles & troops & these terrorists are actively helped by local OGWs. \n\n> Poonch Encounter (Oct 2022) - 5 KIA\n> Shopian Encounter (Oct 2022)- 3 KIA\n> Poonch Ambush (April 2023)- 5 KIA\n> Rajouri Encounter (May 2023)-  5 KIA\n> Anantnag Encounter (Sep 2023)- 2+1 KIA\n> Surankote Encounter (Dec 2023)- 4 KIA, 3 got injured\n\nAmong these deaths were a full squad of 9parasf men that were pushed to their death on a stupid mission. Also how do we kno that a few local OGWs are working for those terrorists? In April 2023 ambush a line army TATA LPTA-715 was carrying food supplies for iftar party at a village, how does terrorists that has been in the jungles of rajouri poonch knew a line truck will be passing down the road Carrying just food? \nSimilarly in December 2023, an ARMY QRT consisting of a gypsy & Tata 715 truck was ambushed by militants, 2 soldiers were beheaded & their heads were taken, the bodies of those soldiers were returned to families without their heads one of the surviving soldier of the ambush identified a local villagers helping the bastards, the RR unit picked up 11 men from the village out of whom 3 were confirmed OGW & they confessed in video about everything from helping the terrorists in ambush to hiding soldiers heads & escape routes for terrorists, those 3 OGWs were killed in torture & army unit was placed under inquiry with court martial for the officer, the video of the torture was leaked resulting in terrorists changing their positions & removing the heads of our troops. \n\nAnother ambush was done at a very critical place within few hundred metres of an IAF long range tracking radar & the dead was an IAF non combat technical person that usually work on radar systems. \n\nThe responsibility of these deaths lie on the army brass that has been responsible for handling the COIN in the area, even after 30 years of CI/CT army has failed to standardise light armoured vehicles & armoured cabins for it's trucks which indian industries have been producing at dirt cheap prices(A Mahindra marksman costs just 48-50lakh)",
        "Never experienced frequent terror attacks in Jammu Division since last 15 yrs... Army has lost in Jammu this time ..",
        "So? Snakes are everywhere in India\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iha3yeujnbbd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b0daabb875a568050a70dbdb893338f5697dc8f\n\nThis is from terrorists telegram. Shivshankar biswas provided info to terrorists",

        "Something that isn't being talked about here, is that this particular attack happened almost 150 km inside the Indian Territory and no, this isn't LOC, but the International Boundary between India and Pak. Right in the mountains",

        "After Manipur and Ladakh, Kashmir is burning",
        "didnt we remove all terrorism by demonetization and abrogation of 370??",
        "For me it sounds like those terrorists got an assurance from a party whose no of MPs have grown significantly and that party which has called for \"vote jihad\" kind of things....",
        ">! I was about to answer that in terms of weather itself but.... that would also have been an accurate depiction of the situation I believe even if it was so hot like those frequent terror attacks a day later everyone got busy in their lives and forgot about that just like how this infrequent rain is making us forget these hot days !<\n\n(At this moment idk wtf I was even yapping about, I just started this and had to finish it somehow ig  ignore this first part please)\n \nComing to your question \nSo yea situation is kinda hot right now especially the people in kathua are anxious and the fact that terrorists are still active and are in that big number is a thing to be afraid of.....but an avg person from jammu doesn't care less I'd say at least right now",

        "How is ladakh burning?",

        "Bcci is not run on tax payers money. It's a private entity and can do whatever it wants with its money. And yes pensions are a problem, when you don't have money to properly arm and give cutting edge equipment to your soldiers. Killer drones and unmanned aircrafts have become a staple for today's battlefields as seen in Ukraine war. Currently, more than half of your budget is just used in pensions and salary. Without modernisation our army won't be able to survive in any future wars no matter how brave they are. I hope the government increases defence budget on 23rd. Many improvements have been in past few years , defence production is at an all time high but it's not enough. Let's hope for the best."
