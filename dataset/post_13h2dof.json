But I feel it is not wrong to have such a thought. People have all kinds of preferences related to appearances so I am not wrong with the above fact. \n\nAnyways... The point I am trying to make is that there will be those who may be unsettled by this pigmentation but there will also be those who will be neutral. And then there will be those who will be drawn towards it. So I guess there's a bright side to everything.",

But, trust me it does, especially if you have patches on the face. People won't say it outright to your face but you can see that many are taken aback by your appearance the first time. Some people will really be assholes about it and some may subconsciously disregard you at public events, interviews, or even as a romantic partner. I read that this is the brain's natural response to people with genetic defects (exactly opposite to how the Halo effect works). Then there is the look of pity you will get.\n\nAll these experiences helped me become a better judge of people though. I can spot assholes/fakers more easily compared to normal people.",

If I were you, I would be thinking of tattooing the pale parts in the same color as your darker skin, and try to get the transition to look seamless so that the art looks like it's a natural part of your skin at first glance. It'd require a skilled tattoo artist to get the color just right, but you could really play around with that. I'd probably be thinking about vaguely mendhi-styled work, it'd look amazing and no one could ever copy you.\n\nAnyway, my own nerdery aside. Sorry to hear you're feeling insecure about your body. People can be assholes, but there's nothing wrong with your skin. There are people who will be put-off by it and there will be other people who find it really interesting and are drawn to you because of it. Own it, it's your skin, everyone should feel comfortable in their skin.",

It changed my perspective for good. And I ditched the mindset and the long sleeves both. It is only an issue if you let it bother you.

        "Vitiligo is not a disease, it's a genetic condition where your body doesn't produce melanin. The MC1R gene provides instructions for making a protein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This receptor plays an important role in normal pigmentation. The receptor is primarily located on the surface of melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. So generally there is no cure for this. There is nothing to be ashamed about here. However, you will encounter illiterate and bigoted people who should be embarrassed about themselves. So just ignore them and go through life projecting confidence. You do need to take care of your skin though, wear spf lotion in the sun, hat, gloves, etc because of the lack of melanin you are at higher risk of skin cancers. Peace and love.",

So in people tell who likes this hand",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "call it a laser engraving and everybody will die to have it For me if I like the person I like everything about it So depends on person not on skin Who said u? Okk thanks 👍 Mmm....white privilege slowly setting in. Jokes aside bruv, I've no problems with it. Thanks bro 😁 If you love someone, you don't see what are their outer characteristics. When I was in my 8th Standard, I fell in love with a girl. She was so beautiful. But my friends had varied opinions about her looks. I just requested them not to say something like that about her to me. Few years later, she had a crush on one of the boys from my friend circle. And he started flirting then. Uhmm, I had no words left for my friend. At least you got a chance I haven't got any chance in school accept of tease 😕 Dw you will get the best person in your life. I can do wait Yes you can. You will. Bhai i know it's odd but all you need to be is more confident in life. If somebody shame you shame them back and trust me you will find somebody who loves you I know someone with the same condition who jerks off imagining it is a white woman jerking him off. I wouldn't be bothered by it. I wouldn't say I 'like it'. But that is not to say I don't like it. Since you mentioned sex organs, let me reveal something to make a point. It has been my fantasy to be with a woman who has vitiligo as the thought of this pigmentation being all over her body really excites me in a positive way, iykwim. People may say \"how can you be drawn to an appearance and not a personality?\". But I feel it is not wrong to have such a thought. People have all kinds of preferences related to appearances so I am not wrong with the above fact. Anyways... The point I am trying to make is that there will be those who may be unsettled by this pigmentation but there will also be those who will be neutral. And then there will be those who will be drawn towards it. So I guess there's a bright side to everything. Know someone with vitiligo who has married a beautiful and a wonderful woman. Don't let vitiligo define you. There is nothing bad to dislike this My goddess that's an awful ugly table you have your hands on It's office table It's not about liking the hand, it's about a person. It's normal bro just as heart, mental etc.issues are. Jyada mat soch is baare. U may proceed in next post What Which part bro.. like the tip or what First, does he sit on his hand to numb it so that it feels like a different person? I don't like your hand any more or less than any other random person's hand. It is a hand. Some time Les education is better At shaft part Thanks bro Thanks bro i find it attractive 👍 Thanks 😊 Cops in America be confused to shoot you or let you go during a traffic stop. Your skin is fine buddy! People get easily freaked out by something uncommon, but that’s not your problem at all. Thanks ma'am/ sir 👌👍 I'll wait for that time Hmm that's broo A girl got vitiligo on her face and mam force us to sit together. Idk how i got vitiligo on my dick from her but luckily it is not increasing (Should I go to the doctor?) Perfectly normal. Don't even think twice about it. I have heard medicines don't really work. But good for you it doesn't need to since it's perfect the way it is Why you care whether people like it or not....it's not that something you can change...don't look for other people's approval. Yes u should because it's spread in body Can I contact with that girl? She is minor No worries I just talk with her ![gif](giphy|81xwEHX23zhvy) Don't get me wrong, I'd have a double take of I saw this for the first time irl, but beyond that it'd be like any other convo Multicolor dick 😳 Lmao This is I ... :)) You aren't alone Great 😃 2 colour only U can dm me There is difference between like and having no problem with this. So, maybe you can reframe your question Not all people are like u Thanks but easy to say until you face that situation Thanks bro 😊 Thanks 😊 >A girl got vitiligo on her face and mam force us to sit together. Idk how i got vitiligo on my dick from her but luckily it is not increasing (Should I go to the doctor?) Then you surely are too ludicrous to get that the person was making a sarcastic comment and trying to troll 🤷‍♀️😅 What? Can we have little conversation TBH it looks bad. Thanks a lot 😊 r/woosh Nice to hear this Mate it's doesn't matter what colour your skin is what matters is that it's healthy and devoid of any illness. Take care bro Yup 👍 Can't wait for cleansing...then the tattoos will start:D Sorry bro Aadha hi saaf hua hai pura saaf kar le vro But seriously don't think of yourself as an outcast just because of this condition. You are a human as we all are Pretty sure you'll make some good money on OnlyFans for being exotic. Jokes aside I don't see it as anything out of normal. I have a family member who has vitiligo and it's just... Normal??? Nothing out of the ordinary. Fun exercise to colour it. Stay inside the lines! 👍 okay Thanks for only fan's offer That can be achieved by using the non dominant hand. I have it on my face. half my moustache (when I dont trim it off) is white in colour). I saw a couple of vitiligo spots on other parts of body (calves and neck) which look similar to when I got my first vitiligo mark on my face before growing. I just stopped medication because it was just a waste of money lmao. Plus not many people are bothered by it and it doesnt seem to be dangerous in anyway. I dont mind it, i think the mark is pretty cool and unique. My very close relative has the same disease,what I will advise if you ever even face any discrimination just ignore the people who are discriminating has cheap mentallity. And this can be treated and this fades with age. Okay bro Best of luck👍👍🌟 You should not take medicine for it… if someone is selling you 6 months package for it just run. It is 99% non-curable and it is not something that will affect your body internally or anything. My father has it… he tried too many medications but no use. Btw it looks cool, you go boi! Okay The hand is fine. The real tragedy here is referring to your own, as a SEX ORGAN. \"Oh yeah ?! Maybe YOU try falling into a vat of Fair & Lovely as a baby !“ This is no problem at all 😊 I have mentioned all area where patches are there but u see only sex organ nice 👍 Thanka bro Depends on who’s hand it is. Why would I share other hands bro why is everything going over ur brain Mere skin colour se match ho jate h toh dikhte nahi BBT I thought it was shadow of something 😅 Bro galti se iska insta bhi open kar diya 🤢🤮🤮 It's cute Tune toh apne reddit ko hi onlyfans bana diya har jagah dick pics daalke bc🥴😑 Thanks for your love Wait till you check out Op's account & all his other gw/nsfw posts😂 Even I have vitiligo, I got this when I was 17, I tried allopathic medicines for over an year but it didnt work. My father then convinced me to visit a ayurvedic doctor, I tried her medicines for 1 month and Voila! it worked. Obviously it didnt cured me but made white patches darker Interracial couple child He's not cursing the table. Hes just showing that people won't think its ugly because you have skin condition. If all of us would have vitiligo then people would not be thinking bad about it. There are worse skin conditions out there than this. So don't worry friend. You are as beautiful as you are. Even plants and animals have bad pigmentation. Look at white pigs. Or white carrots. You are a unique being among us. Don't overthink it if you can't cure it. 🤮eww 🤢 For me personality matters bro, not the skin 😉 OP comments like a bot more than a bot Bro is becoming less susceptible to being called out as a call center boi He is new to reddit man. Perhaps he doesnt know what woosh subreddit is for. Meri ex ki yaad dilla di tune th! 🥲 Don't know much about this , but read somewhere that medicines don't really help in curing vitiligo? I think you should see this [article](https://unbelievable-facts.com/2023/04/man-with-vitiligo-and-heterochromia.html) You are right r/woosh Lol check out Op's profile and all those gross posts😭😨 Toh bc tu itna dick pics post karega subs mai toh kya karsakte lo🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Wait till you check Op's profile and the dick pics😨 Then check Op's profile and find the other gross posts attractive 😨 I'm sorry you had to read that. Mehendi hai sajne vaali, haathon me jachne vaali What did you mean when you said Stop medicine and start taking mdicine? I too have vitiligo from childhood but thode Kam level par bachpan se jaisi hi hoti thi doctor ke pass chale jate the hum log or oitnment use krke 2,3 month mai thik hojata tha then, mera seasonal hai i guess, abhi phir strt hogya 1,2 month se I mostly have it on legs, got to know from doctor ye kabhi thik nahi ho skta , bs dwai lgao or badhne MTT do Ok...😐 Uh man saw that, wtf? Anyways... I had vitiligo on my face some years back (minor patches around the lips) and got treated for it at the very early stages. The patches are less visible now as I use a beard to cover them. I will just say one thing: Many people will tell you that it doesn't matter. But, trust me it does, especially if you have patches on the face. People won't say it outright to your face but you can see that many are taken aback by your appearance the first time. Some people will really be assholes about it and some may subconsciously disregard you at public events, interviews, or even as a romantic partner. I read that this is the brain's natural response to people with genetic defects (exactly opposite to how the Halo effect works). Then there is the look of pity you will get. All these experiences helped me become a better judge of people though. I can spot assholes/fakers more easily compared to normal people. I like it. If it was mine I’d paint my nails with similar patterns. Bruh \"It\" Why would anyone like anything abnormal. Accept that your hand is not normal. And develop a personality where people ignore the hand and fall in love with the person. Fake assurance that your hand is beautiful will not take you far. Bhai don't change yourself for others, i personally like your vitiligo skin 😄 No thanks go full on michael jackson on it, instant murika passport confirmed + u get free guns ngl ,your fingers r really pretty! I had a teacher with this condition. I called him choco vanilla sir. As a fan of body art, I'm a little jealous tbh. Have you ever thought of getting tattoos? There's sooooo much stuff you could do with such a unique canvas. If I were you, I would be thinking of tattooing the pale parts in the same color as your darker skin, and try to get the transition to look seamless so that the art looks like it's a natural part of your skin at first glance. It'd require a skilled tattoo artist to get the color just right, but you could really play around with that. I'd probably be thinking about vaguely mendhi-styled work, it'd look amazing and no one could ever copy you. Anyway, my own nerdery aside. Sorry to hear you're feeling insecure about your body. People can be assholes, but there's nothing wrong with your skin. There are people who will be put-off by it and there will be other people who find it really interesting and are drawn to you because of it. Own it, it's your skin, everyone should feel comfortable in their skin. Yes that's a broo Yes officer this comment right here I am having crush on a girl having vitiligo I always thought people with those marks all over their body were the result of a fire accident or something. Dunno how many folks have heard this but growing up as a child I used to hear this happens if one has dahi (curd) after eating non veg. Then realised curd goes into marination of meat and gravy anyways 😭 Ayoooo wtffff!😭😭 Teri maa ka woosh Brother are u ok? 💀 Love it.. I think that so personalised and makes one unique. I find people with vitiligo,who dont do make up, one step ahead in the society.. I understand its a disease but just embrace it. Vanilla aur Chocolate flavour me ![gif](giphy|7k2LoEykY5i1hfeWQB) I had a skin condition because of which I was so embarassed that I wore full sleeves for years...it just became my normal..but I hated it. And it was right in the late teens and early twenties time when everyone your age is all about looking good and wearing awesome clothes. Then one day on a busy, happening market street I saw a girl walking in front of me, with a biiiig burn scar on her arm..and she was least bothered about it or about anyone looking at it. It changed my perspective for good. And I ditched the mindset and the long sleeves both. It is only an issue if you let it bother you. The moment you accept that this is you and you are okay with it, it really gets okay 🙂 and you really have to cross that fence only one time. Then you're on the other side. My father is 57 and all white because of Vitiligo. It started back when he was 22-23. He used to feel bad for himself when he was young. He had to accept it and move on. He didn't make this his identity. Obviously he is different and he has been termed chitkabra and other funny words. Do I hate him or does my family hate him or does anyone hate him because of this?: Hell No. Take care of yourself :) Honest opinion . .... I dont have this disease and i dont have any white patches on my body But if had any of these my life would not have less fucked as it is already in deep shit . Take my words ...life is not how good or bad you appear . You would anyways succeed in searching anything that makes you not at all you and in ways sucks being you. So friend if skin pigmentation is only problem of your life .. you are blessed . By the way you are beautiful 😍 ![gif](giphy|xTiTnvtbvEEArLmDao) Vitiligo is not a disease, it's a genetic condition where your body doesn't produce melanin. The MC1R gene provides instructions for making a protein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This receptor plays an important role in normal pigmentation. The receptor is primarily located on the surface of melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. So generally there is no cure for this. There is nothing to be ashamed about here. However, you will encounter illiterate and bigoted people who should be embarrassed about themselves. So just ignore them and go through life projecting confidence. You do need to take care of your skin though, wear spf lotion in the sun, hat, gloves, etc because of the lack of melanin you are at higher risk of skin cancers. Peace and love. I used to date a guy who has this. He was so cute and good in every way. But now we live in totally different geographies. U will do amazing in ur life. <3 my bro half dabi structure,yellow flames rip 😨 Just a regular hand Do we have to like/not like it? Can I just feel indifferent about it? Like a popsicle My sibling has it, it doesn't bother him nor my family. Lmao wtf Take a look at his profile Lmao Two last braincells interacting Uh this is OP's kink actually... Not fishing for sympathy. Check out his profile. While you're at it, please put more effort into taking dick pics. I can see a bucket in one of them. I had a feeling this was a kink post. But r/India is too innocent these days. I guess I don't need your opinion Next up... OP's dick. You never know op is men or women. I like it Their profile would disagree... (It's extremely NSFW. You have been warned). Yep. You don't. Infact, you don't need anyone's opinion. You've posted the same post on r/indiangirlsontinder, not to mention photos of your pen!$ with your hand on numerous NSFW subs. If this is not a fishing expedition, then what is? Thanks though You ~~The Conjuring:The Devil~~ made me do it Your black privilege's haven been rewoked Not to mention their real name on reddit profile. When the Loin King himself is asking you to take it easy... Op forgot that Reddit profiles aren't private 😂 As a sibling of a person having this, I want to give an advise, if you are taking any medicine, make sure its contents doesn't include things like steroid, in our case, he got diabetes probably from that only. Shouldnt this question be in r/kink or r/fettish?? 😂 I'll be very honest about this. I am on the other end of the spectrum. I have hyperpigmentation where the skin on my face can get really dark (3-4 shades darker than my body) and small dark patches. Indian society in general tend to be a bit less evolved about imperfections, and not only about vitiligo but even diabetes etc. I live in UK now and people here are lot more accepting about it (mostly!! I'm not claiming that UK is a utopia regarding this). I have a girl in my team who has vitiligo (although mild and in small patches), but has no issues finding dates. But good thing is, looking at the comments on this post, it seems things are changing!! Good !! But a liberal progressive educated sub like r/India isn't really a representation of what actual india behaves honestly Like thanos with the stone lmao Like, No i don't like myself or anyone else to have that. That's a disease. I myself had heavy Psoriasis on my body and under treatment for a couple of years, 90% of it's gone but i would say my hands are not pretty even with that 10%. If the question is about liking the person the color/shape of the hand or any part of the body is irrelevant. what did you do to prevent it? i have small patch of it on lips and its like that for 2 years now it hadnt grown neither reduced and the patches were at 2 more place on my face but they have gone now i have been prescribed tacrolimus ointment but it doesnt works on my lips Bro you have a huge advantage when doing that thing 😜 The only person who has to like it is you, rest is up to them and that is not your concern brother. It's just skin colour not big deal Idon't have any problem at all but it doesn't look good What the actual fuck 💀 Depends what you are doing with it I have this on my legs, initially got super stressed, went to a doc, he gave me a long list of meds. I couldn't follow that routine, so left it as it is. It hasnt grown any further neither reduced since then. It's not just about your appearance vitiligo is acquired autoimmune disease so to stop taking medications is not good God gave you - 50 weapon skills and 50 scamming skills xD /s Tbh, I don't mind you have it or anyone else has it. It doesn't change the person. But if someone gave me the choice to have skin like that, I would not like it on myself. Better consult a physician to be sure, the internet says there could be complications down the line but still it's not that common to have any serious complication. So according to the internet it's entirely your choice. As far as social stigma goes, if you are a guy it doesn't matter at all, maybe you will be considered exotic if anything, if you are a girl then it is a bit troublesome, personally I don't care but there are creepy fanatics out there. Hey cmon you have unlocked an extra skin not everyone have that No hate Would love to be friends with someone like you One of my friend has it too.. Does any one know the cause.?.its not what our parents say don't mix milk with meat etc Does vitiligo affect any health choices? Change your name to Mai ka laal Jai kishan Lol exactly 😂 Cannot say much without meeting the owner of the hand. Like? Be proud of who you are. Anyone that hates your skin doesnt deserve your thoughts What the f is there in that to like specifically ? It’s like any other hand I’ve seen. Character skin (game) I have a patch near me lips and i can't hide it also as the moustache also has white hair. So i have to shave almost everyday I have had a patch for the oast 25 years. It doesn't grow neither it reduces. I have tried everything from homeopathy to allopathy to ayurveda. Only unani helped because the medicine which was given to be applied was little brown in colour so it kinda looked like my skin colour. But trust me nothing works on vitiligo What's that even supposed to mean lol The heck is wrong with your profile bro??! I personally don't mind it since I grew up with a family member who had the onset of universal vitiligo early in life so I am used to seeing it. But I won't sugar coat it, other people Will stare, make fun of you and depending on which part of the world you are in staying in : they will consider you ill and contagious and their behaviour will be clouded by their irrational, petty biases. Don't let any of that bullshit affect you though, there will still be people who will be perfectly fine with it. And you will be able to live your life to the fullest without letting it affect your quality of life. The few things that you should pay attention to is sun exposure and skin damage, since you'll be much more susceptible to it than the average person. And also DO NOT use cock and bull snake oil medications like homeopathy or dangerous ayurvedic concoctions since these things can end up harming you far more than what people's gazes or words will ever be capable of. Edit:spelling Bro got legendary skin unlocked. Ofcourse, it's cool with me oh i see User name checks out:) Who likes skin color? Bruh If you are my friend idc about how you look like being honest One of my friends has it too it's not a big deal Sabse bada rog kya kahenge log. Don't know personally, I love ppl with vitiligo sry if it sounds stereotypical ..my sci teacher had it .... I loved that women so much 10/10 will suck on it I had vitiligo,by the way still has some patches left,i don't know how my disease subsided. At some point i stopped caring about it.I had some kind of ayurvedic treatment. It had strict diet like abstaining from eating chicken, egg,sour food etc .I think mostly the diet reduced the patches not the treatment itself It is a terrible disease to have, people look at you like you are a freak.I started not to care about it and still got some sympathy stares. Just live your life the way you want. Not a big deal mate.. only a skin color difference. Rest you are as same as me Natural Tattoo I don't like it. Always very interesting to see! God is making you more unique! I was prescribed a cream too. Don't remember the name but I never went to Homeopaths or Ayurvedic medicine (don't trust them). Yes, the ones near the lips don't go away. I wonder if it's got to do with the softer skin there. No specific diet. Have to take lots of Vitamin D pills though as I have been asked to stay away from the sun as much as possible. You restarted the system while updates were installing That's the thing, so many people in India will tell me that my vitiligo can indeed be fixed. Many point to ayurveda. However, doctors in Denmark (where I live), say that no cure exists. N word pass loading.. its natural for people to freak out when they see things uncommon. To be true when i first see a colleague with this during my internship, my expression might not have given other guy a comfortable zone but he became one of my best friend while I worked there. Just be good and others perception changes quickly you won’t even realize.. Fuck yeah man, I took ayurvedic medicines for my autoimmune condition too. Saved my life. Ujwal? Yep. I mean, no kink shaming, but I felt bad for folks commenting here sincerely... So imo this looks a bit like karma farming. But who am I to know... For all its worth, OP might indeed be conscious about this and genuinely asking. Profile is entertaining nevertheless. 😇 Oh I don't think OP minds... Exactly what I meant, especially since op was defensive about it being a kink... 😂 They’re lovely. Have you ever heard of Winnie Harlow? She’s a woman, but she’s a model who has vitiligo, notably on her face. But she’s gorgeous and she’s a very popular model who’s won competitions and shot for a lot of high profile campaigns. And her beauty and distinctness is directly bc of her vitiligo. People with vitiligo are a unique type of wonderful. Your hands look nice and well-moisturized which is what matters most. Anything doesn't matter if u r rich #**KIRA YOSHIKAGE ENTERS THE CHAT** The dude has a thing for exhibitionism. I think this whole post is to get some reach for his other posts. There's a famous super model who has the same condition. Winnie Harlow, I might like her hands:p Almost there! Even I have... My friends are always suprised after looking at my palm and lips because of this I have tried everything possible as i have facing the issue for the past 25 years but to no avail. I don't even dye my beard because i have been told that this disease might aggravate if chemicals are used on this. You have to wear it proudly, be confident and conquer what you can. Also, I think your hand looks cool. Ur penis small Parts with no hair and skin directly above bone doesn't respond well. Theory is Melanocytes in hair follicles can be stimulated to produce more melanin(which gives colour to the skin) that's why hairless areas are difficult to treat. . Oh. That clarifies a lot. Thanks! Ayurveda, unani etc are all pseudoscience. They only help slightly in preventing the disease, they can't cure anything Bruv I too have vitiligo....really amusing how are hands look almost similar lolll Milk and fish too apparently You say as though all those numbers are equal. Drawn will be like 1 in a million, neutral 10 in a million, and all the rest are repelled by it. Yes, I sort of agree with you. But your estimates are extreme. Surely more people are drawn and are neutral than your estimates I hope. Also, repel is a strong word. More like unsettled or uncomfortable? Yeah I know. I mentioned these figures to bring in my perspective. I have been through this, I know how it feels. The number of people unsettled by it (for relationships) is so high that you stop approaching people in general because you are conditioned to believe that it's not going to work. You'd rather save yourself the energy and mental peace. Just noticed this 😂 You say my estimates are extreme... But you have a kink for a vitiligo female and literally your handle reads \"one-in-many-billion\" 🤣 Absolutely true. Most of the people with vitiligo I have met are extremely empathetic and show love to others. They have been through harsh judgement. Vitiligo is a taboo in many places in India . No. It's skin pigmentation disorder. The cells that make skin colour get weaker . Recently I saw two women with vitiligo. One of them was looking at me and hiding that part of her face that had the patch. She looked anxious. Another one was hiding the part of her face too . I wonder how is it for women to have it ,when other women are embracing their beauty /makeup .and then there are people scared to show their face. I felt like asking one of them why she looked so troubled . It's not like that I was staring them hard ...just my eyes met with someone walking by and they looked so anxious .But I'm not some one that goes to talk to random people much. Hey I hope i can be of any help for you There is this Dr.Nitika Kohli I have seen her making people get rud of their vitiligo through Ayurveda You should contact her and see if the treatment works for you"
