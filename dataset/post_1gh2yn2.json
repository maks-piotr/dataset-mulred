    "selftext": "I come from a smaller college in Kolkata and have friends in IITs—friends I assisted significantly with assignments and projects during COVID. However, I never aspired to attend an IIT or NIT. My focus has always been on tech innovation rather than institutional prestige. While I have a strong foundation in physics and mathematics, which served me well in the JEE, I chose to prioritize meaningful work over obtaining a degree from a \"prestigious\" college.\n\nSince graduating, I founded a deep tech company called Aestheticaa, specializing in AI and developing our own proprietary algorithms. Like many startups, we face significant challenges regarding data processing power; training models with tens or hundreds of millions of rows of multimodal data is simply not feasible without substantial infrastructure. While private institutes have shown willingness to support us, they often lack the necessary resources. We reached out to ISI, but they seem unwilling to consider collaborations with anyone without a PhD.\n\nRecently, I attended a startup event where I met a representative from IIT KGP who oversees their startup investments. I had hoped this conversation would lead to promising opportunities, but his dismissive comment, “Hamare yaha bache toh hostels me ye bana lete hai,” was infuriating. I responded, “Then why isn't this product on the market yet? Or at least available as a GitHub repo?”\n\nThis kind of gatekeeping feels unjustified, suggesting that institutional background outweighs actual capability and innovation. While I may not excel in chemistry or even physics, I possess strong fundamentals in mathematics and am quite competitive in computer science — skills that are essential for building and succeeding in today’s job market, which I have demonstrated by securing multiple solid job offers.\n\nWhat is so special about being an “IITian” when the knowledge provided by these institutions is readily accessible online for anyone willing to learn?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8jnkzg1w9yd1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=92531f91fc650d7dcc74b2ff8782dcf21f2946b7\n\n",

        "Could you expand on what your business does? You train what type of ai models? What's new about it?\n\n\nAlso coming to topic yes India has thie weird prestige issue and this weird need to feel superior to others. \n\n\nThis is mostly also seen in Indian vs foreign interviewer in interviews. The Indian guy always keeps pestering you with more and more questions until the question is so niche you just wouldn't know.",
        "yeah , as i went through the interview season with multiple MNCs i have got this , sadly when they asked niche questions in my field of expertise ( databases and dev ) i answered pretty much everything , they had to went to a completely different in languages that i dont use ( still some how got the job ) also i noticed this the higher the salary package the more they would do this shitty thing \n\ncoming to answering you , what we do is we are trying to teach AI how to interpret art , not just guess and halucinate i know its very ambitious and more over we have a weird / tricky approach but if that works out it might just be the key... we would have liked to just skip these elitist institutes but its not ready for investment unless some angel investor throws some money at as and forgets about it",
        "Bro focus on building your start up. Why are some IITians obnoxious is a waste of time. \n\nStill to answer your question - A lot of IITians have done great things. It's difficult to get into an IIT. There is a reason why companies offer such high packages. IITs no doubt are the best engineering under grad colleges in India\n\n Sundar Pichai , Ashneer Grover, Sachin Bansal, Narayan Murthy, Bhavish Agarwal , Parag Agarwal  etc etc are just a few names \n\nThere is a reason why everyone looks up to ivy leagues. When someone says he is from Harvard , you know that person is different. Same goes for IITs \n\nPS - Not all IITians are obnoxious. Maybe you met a different lot.",
        "Man I agree. I dropped out of IIT in masters after 3 weeks because I can’t deal with assholes. Not a single person I have met there has a life, all of them I met were self centered messed up people who just brag about their stupidity (aka intelligence).",
        "yeah so what ? some has done some things and ? most of them do have just second hand pride . yes IITs are hard to get in , you try ? its easy enough. i didnt tried still had a good enough rank . comapnies do offer high packages ? yes but not all get that yes its better than pretty much any other btech college in india but that doesnt really mean anything , that doesnt discount the fact that people can learn from ANYWHERE to start with.  all i am saying instead of just assuming we shoud just test people out and no most IITians i have met arent obnoxious around me , cause they know in my field of work i am better than them.",
        ">what we do is we are trying to teach AI how to interpret art , not just guess and halucinate\n\nInterpret art meaning? It has been time honored knowledge that interpretation of art is subjective... specially when it comes to understanding the mind of the creator of the art piece.  For example - the Mona Lisa has a few different interpretations of what it represents based on which historian you talk to. What will your model be trained to do specifically? You mentioned multi-modal... do you expect your model to interpret visual as well as audio forms of art?\n\n\nI ask these questions because I imagine that if the area of application is too niche,  there may not be a huge market.  And when there's not a sufficient size of the market,  investors don't really see returns in investing large amounts of compute costs and salaries on a product a few thousand people will appreciate.\n\n\nAs it pertains to IIT, these people have put in blood,  sweat and tears to get in.  Some amount of ego is expected.  You'd have it too if you had worked hard and was literally 1 in a thousand to achieve the entry into IIT.",
        "dude i could have got into Any NIT this year , maybe even some IITs to start with , had a good enough gate score , but not enough to get into ISI , so i dropped the idea as i already have a quite competitive package as a fresher even when compared to the peers in IITs and NITs",
        "Most of those IITians think they are a different breed of indians after passing the exam.",
        "Okay if you didn't try hard still got a good enough rank in JEE, you are really smart \n\nAnd if you are good enough, just shut them up with your work. Simple !",
        "Well ? that ego means nothing when you are in the same room , with other IITians , sitting in the same chair , working on the same projecst as me ? attending the same events ? ( i have attended meetings on invites while some IITians paid for their entry ) so only one question , all that hard work to get into an institute and where does it bring you ? \n\nand to answer your questions , There are two things called Emotions and feelings , Emotions arent really subjective they are pretty much inate and almost all humans show similar kind of emotions , Feelings on the other hand is a subjective thing , we work primarily with emotions. and theres a thing called the other side of the coin , our algorithms should be capable of showing you both and even a completely new one as well . \n\nand yes its multi-modal we are working with Visual , Aural and Literary Stimuli thats what our research paper is on , if you want to get a better idea i can give you some book recommendations if you wanna read about art and how the human brain gets stimulated by it",
        "You don't sound any better with this complete generalization over 1 incident",
        "Do i have an ego ? Hell yeah i do  , i prefer calling it PRIDE . do i listen to others ? also yes , do i talk to people like they are human beings and can know more than me ? ABSOLUTELY YES",
        "I was talking about the blatant generalization here lol, where did all this talk about ego and pride come from?",
        "i thought \" you dont sound any better \" reffered to me being an elitist as well",
        "first of all, the good will hunting scene doesnt work here cuz anyone whos parents are rich enough and/or legacy can easily make into ivy league but anyone can make it into iit if they work hard enough\n\n>What is so special about being an “IITian” when the knowledge provided by these institutions is readily accessible online for anyone willing to learn?\n\nthe knowledge to get into IIT was readily available but u just didnt put in the effort\n\nand colleges are less about knowledge but more about calibre nowadays, if you meet someone from some random college out of the 4000 engineering colleges then you cant really tell; but if you meet someone from IIT you can tell thatre theyre hardworking and good at their field.\n\nits easier for an employer to pick an IITian becuz they know that someone who made it into iit is good at what they do without need ing to test much. While i agree some iitians are obnoxious, but ofc some are gonna have a superiority complex when they meet someone from some no name college and see them going \"why are they picking iitians over us???\"",
        "maybe if you did try you couldve gotten a good placement from an iit and earning a good amount and saving for the future rather than crying on the internet about how your life is tough cuz you didnt work hard when someone else did",
        "Used to be the case a decade ago. Now high packages are the exception and international placements are extremely rare and almost have no contribution from the institute but rather completely because of the student.",
        "I wasn't talking about that, i don't know if you are an elitist or arrogant or not. But that type of generalisation is probably an even worse thing to do, it's like saying 'all Indians are scammers' just because some of them are, so tell me are you a scammer?",
        "Yes , true... but IITs do cost quite a lot of money compared my college ( mine did a fraction of that for me) so it does kinda work .\n\nbut i do agree for an employer its easier to pick from an IIT because they were the kids that followed the rules and worked hard enough to get into the institute so they can grind their ass as an employee better than a generally lazier student from a regular institute",
        "Go to any matrimony app, IITians get sold out like hot cakes. LMAO\n\nFirst of all Indians are so obsessed with job rather than buisness. Most of them think job is safe and secure whereas if you put right efforts on one business, your entire family and your future kids can also live off on it. Hence IITians are the ones to recieve highest packages. They get selected in Higher institutions fast. They get respect in society. That's why they have this arrogance attitude.",
        "i hope you are doing better my friend",
        "even the HIgher packages that we see , are mostly joining bonus , esop ( and the company can go f in bankrupt unless its like the top 5 companies ) and the actual inhand second year onwards isnt that high",
        "ah i get your point",
        "you know life isnt Secure at all , i am good at tech , always was . i come from a pretty artistic family i wanted to study interactive media , had a portfolio ( made that instead of studying in 11/12 ) and was even able to get scholarships in canada that year  but you know what year i was supposed to go ? 2020 , COVID AGAYA BHAI . and i had to join Btech",
        "The field you're talking about is too niche for most people. I can't even comprehend how many people would actually use this. I assume most art enthusiasts enjoy finding meaning and details in arts. The process of doing it is what makes them happy. If an AI can actually do that how many people would want that?\n\nAgain idk anything about the art interpretation field so I might be severely wrong.",
        "You only know that a world outside rech exists when you have strong examples. But only tech is so much glorified in india. Every other thing is nullified in India. I see many non-tech people starting buisness and making money as much as IITians, and low key they have a life, do activities, they never talk about money.\n\nBut the society only gives attention to a loud idiot rather than a calm individual.",
        "My small college gave me a chance to work with all big VFX / animation houses in india ( have worked red chillies and was offered a role at green gold as well ) while I worked hard enough to home my skills in tech and is building my companies tech in house.\n\nPeople who manage a million dollar fund , people with a minimum cheque size of 1cr has more respect for people like us then the investment heads of these estimated institutes who can't even fund more than 25lakhs in one go and that too at a very significant chunk of the company",
        "I mean I am not going towards the applications , as that's handled by my co founder... I build the underlying tech with another co founder and the tech can not only interpret art but a multitude of other things it just started as visual / aural arts but turns out if you can process art you can process just regular old stuff and precisely break down things in a emotionally intelligent way as well.",
        "I already have a good paying job on hold though... And it's quite competitive",
        "Yes mike rosses exists and so do Harvey Spectors, and believe me I have been in the same rooms as the IITians trying to get investments , have pitched to VCs that won't even look at you if you are not trying to raise 2CR , been in a shark tank like pitching scenario twice where the net value of their funds is couple hundred million dollars . But the biggest but is that the Harvey Spectors in the field are not my peers but those who run the institutes and won't let outsiders like us get into it. Harvey gave mike a chance but most of these people in power are like jessicas or louis in the earlier seasons"

iitians obnoxious ofc gon na superiority complex meet someone name college see going picking iitians us maybe try couldve gotten good placement iit earning good amount saving future rather crying internet life tough cuz didnt work hard someone else used case decade ago high packages exception international placements extremely rare almost contribution institute rather completely student wasnt

And it's quite competitive Yes mike rosses exists and so do Harvey Spectors, and believe me I have been in the same rooms as the IITians trying to get investments , have pitched to VCs that won't even look at you if you are not trying to raise 2CR , been in a shark tank like pitching scenario twice where the net value of their funds is couple hundred million dollars . But the biggest but is that the Harvey Spectors in the field are not my peers but those who run the institutes and won't let outsiders like us get into it. Harvey gave mike a chance but most of these people in power are like jessicas or louis in the earlier seasons"
