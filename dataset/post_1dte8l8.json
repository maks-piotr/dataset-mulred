I mean if it is about in a kingdom/dictatorship/religious country like Pakistan that is a valid concern\n\nAnd conversion to other religion is a basic right in any secular country and if a dalit who wants to convert becoz he fells he is being discriminated by his fellow religious people and wants to convert to other religion then who r u stop? \n\nAnd the same time who is stopping orange ppl from converting back to hinduism of those who is born in abrahamic religion?

Conservative Christians in the US have been very much pushing for abolition of secular rule of law. \n\n\nDo you think the deeply conservative Christian countries in Europe are as secular in both laws and society as the ones with a lower percentage of conservative Christians? \n\n\nDo you think banning beef in states is secular? Do you think lynching people to death over suspicions of having it is?

        "What they should stop is the promoters and marketers who go around fooling people to convert just for the sake of conversion. \n\n\nIf by some chance people find they are more attuned to different religion, then conversion is something of a personal matter and shouldn't be upto the government to decide. \n\n\nI've seen with my own eyes how coercive some people are, they tend to reach out at the most opportune time and guilt trip you into converting yourself. That's not moral or right by any sense. A person should only convert if they want a spiritual change! Not a social or economic change! That's where the line between good relegion and toxic institutional relegion blurs to nonexistent. \n\n\n\n\nMajor reason why I lost faith in these \"centres\" of religion, and why i think it's for our own good if we lower the importance of one's religion in the political structure. And this only happens if education is progressed further, there's a huge lack of critical thinking skills built up in the nation. Children just churn the same answers like Xerox machines with little to no understanding of what it is or how it is applied in real life. \n\n\nIt's these kind of children that grow up to be scholars, professors, doctors etc... Yet still be so deluded in the fictional world they do unholy acts of sacrificing their own children or heck even mass suicides. \n\n\n\n\nAlso doesn't help the cream of the crop 99% of the time leave the country, where are our decades of iitians when the country needs them?

This is why it has been a tool of war and colonization.\n\nIt is fair to say while a physical presence and keeping puppet government have been instrumental in colonizing the he land conversion by the western religions is colonizing the mind.\n\nI am ok with religions as long as they get rid of God and and are ok with others beliefs...

    "light_cleaned_title": "India's Majority Population Would Be In Minority One Day If Conversions In Religious Congregations Not Stopped: Allahabad HC",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "The court said \"Article 25 of the Constitution of India provides for Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion, but it does not provide for conversion from one faith to another faith...The word 'Propagation' means to promote, but it does not mean to convert any person from his religion to another religion”",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I'm sure that by the time that may happen, the Allahabad HC will itself cease to be relevant. Thr judge need to undertake a course on population studies. Is this an acknowledgement that being a minority is bad in India? The anxiety is really about losing the people they are taught are below them. I will be more worried about India’s total population rather than who is in majority. How the heck are we supposed to manage this country with 2.5+ Billion people !!!! Shaata. Because there will be sharia in place. There's little difference between religious laws. They're all anti humanity and woman. BJP is the same. That inference is illogical. The concern is that Sharia will replace secular laws. do you want secular laws or sharia? Do you think we have hindu laws (e.g. Manu etc) or secular law now? They are, they're just not called hindu laws they're called laws Whatsapp band karo unkill. Constitution theoretically exists to prevent that. Now if you modify the Constitution to favour one religion over another piece by piece (like how NDA is doing to favour a section of upper caste, upper class Hindus over other minorities), then it is not far fetched to assume that given the right circumstances, an extreme section from any societal sect can take advantage of that to take the country in any direction. Which means secularism is in fact very weak in this country, whether it against Hindus or Muslims. Now with that knowledge, is it fair to assume that being in a minority in India current, is in fact, not a great place to be in? Make this your thing, please. It's hilarious. ???????????????? The irony is fucking insane. There's no way you think the way the government Haas governed for the last 10 years is actually secular. They made a mockery of the constitution. So is the majority religion so bad that people are converting ? What is that supposed to mean ? Have read the article? or your Mentality is to think about Muslims when there is anything mentioned Religious Conversions. Following is quoted from the linked article. \"Importantly, the bench also noted that it has come to its attention in several cases that unlawful conversions of people from SC/ST castes and other economically disadvantaged groups to Christianity are occurring at a \"rampant pace\" throughout the State of Uttar Pradesh.\" It's an acknowledgement that the Judg uses WhatsApp more than they should Allahabad and Gujarat HC on a competition Facts toh bas opinions hote hain. Opinions to sab ke bhi pas hote hain. Ye lo mere factopinions. :proceeds to bend down pants and bend down and take a dump all over the high court: Here is hoping incompetence can be weeded out of the judiciary. Translation: facts are just opinions. Everyone can have opinions. These are my factopinions. Conversion from one faith to another faith for the sake of financial gain or other material benefits is undesirable and should be stopped. Who is stopping the so called (read fake) Protectors of Hindu Dharma to convert born Muslims and born Christians to Hindu Religion. Honest answer will reveal the bitter truth. Thats not that bad then. Also it's not my mentality, but based on what I see and hear happening all over the world. Europe, being predominantly Christian, has liberal and secular laws. Guess which community is saying they can't live without sharia, demanding sharia there and having violent protests. Caste system is a brutal everyday reality for millions of Indians. It is absolutely logical for a lower caste Hindu to convert from a religion which treats them as sub-human. Every year, tens of thousands of Dalits convert to Buddhism, often en masse on Ambedkar Jayanti. If Upper Caste Hindus wont accept absolute equality, then undoubtedly Hinduism will become a minority religion. There is no need to whine about it. Adapt or Die. Koi isko nfhs-5 ka report padhao. Konsa gaanja phook raha hai Allahabad HC wale Seems you think only you are learned.. like all chantus Hahaha yeah sheria law will come It is quite possibly the best reason to convert. To materially benefit your life and your families in exchange for saying you believe in one imaginary deity versus another? Hell yeah. Why is it undesirable? Do you know we have statue of Manu outside high court of jaipur , rajasthan? Many laws are based on Manu and high court judges have referred teaching of Manu while passing judgment If converting to a minority religion gives better material benefit then how can we claim we are ruled by a hindutva fascist government. Come on we have to maintain that the ruling government is oppressing the minorities. So that we can shit on the fascist government. Maths is not the strongest point of bhakts even though they admire aryabhatt, even if you convert 1lkah hindus every day ,it will take around 10 years for hindus to fall below majority mark Fucking orange fascist. Someone please explain how this meritdhari deserves to be on the high court. What has the NDA done ? I'm not aware of such a law favoring upper castes Hindus over others The statue is a curious case. I just read about it. It was installed when both state and central govt was under congress rule, they did not object!! And it was VHP who filed a pil against it, which is stayed till date. Can you believe that. On your second point, no indian laws are not based on Manu, Indian laws are based of English common laws, which incorporated some protestant christian values along with some secular principles. Some sections are dropped later. You will find same criminal laws, section by section in all British colonies too. Me: Salaam alaikum judge. Judge: Wa alaikum... abe saale! Majority in danger! True Math is not mathing being a minority in shria enforced country is definitely not good. 3 examples of what you said why he doesn't. we have padt examples of what he said and we also have examples of what he didn't because of some reasons India is already ruled by Minorities in all sense - politics, art, culture, values, business. That minority is upper caste hindus. Upper caste Hindus are a minority Do they even understand these ridiculous statements. 100 cr vs 20 cr. How is it ever going to take over? You would think % of Buddhists in country would have increased every decade by these \"tens of thousands conversions\" lol >The applicant had allegedly assured the informant that her brother, who was suffering from a mental illness, would be treated and returned to his native village within a week. However, he was converted to Christianity instead. The FIR lodged against the applicant alleged that he had converted many people to Christianity Half the thread is talking about Sharia and other about Dalits/Upper castes. Makes you wonder if they have read what the article is about hahahahha so true! all of them graduates from wahtsapp univ watch this judge getting promoted to supreme court!...i promise you he is. What a bunch of morons. It’ll take 280+ yrs just for the minority to get past the 40% mark that too if current trends hold. If climate change doesn’t do us in by then, global nuclear war definitely will They think minorities will kill them or grow too much in size That isn't really happening now is this statement by HC is going to happen, though still a big problem, caste injustice towards lower castes is mostly restricted to rural areas and definitely isn't a threat enough to make hinduism a minority, be realistic. The judge should redo his graduation if he thinks the Constitution does not allow/account for consensual religious conversions. It's literally a fundamental right under Right to Freedom of Religion, as long as you aren't breaking any other laws We talk about abolishing caste system and establishing caste equality when people like you can't help but bring it back in every unrelated issue talking about division, i wonder who is the one promoting division right here 🤔. 'HIGH' court There are several structural issues. Donations to Hindu temples are taken by the govt. and temples are supposed to do the social work but are hamstrung. OTOH Christian and Islamic institutions can do whatever social work they want. Extend that to educational institutions where Christians can establish institutes and provide free education and reservations to Christians. Hindu institutions aren’t allowed to provide reservations to say SC Hindus for eg. The system isn’t equal. imo govt should either pull all funds from all religious orgs and then spend it. Or let Hindu institutions do what their Muslim and Christian counterparts can do. I was talking about cases like this . Hey gather a bunch of ppl.. sprinkle some magic dust on them.. hey suddenly they are all Fairies.. if they go to a temple now the deities on the entrance will drive the spear up their backside. That's the kind of scenario I can imagine. You don't lose your belief just because of some random ceremony in a group. You have to be motivated for switching and it's not instantaneous. Don't go in for this propaganda of mass conversion. No one can change religion without their will. Nothing stops them from switching back as well. Why can't we free Hindu temples, create an elected body out of it that is responsible for creating and renovating temples, gurukuls and most importantly, start a Hindu missionary for those interested in India and abroad?? Why resisting conversions? Sabko equal chance hi de do. Log apna apna zor laga lein, sab apna apna decide kar lenge religion. This people are so paranoid. As long as no one is forcing conversion, why is that a problem? If all Hindus want to become Christian(completely bogus fear!) or some new AI based religion, shouldn't we have the right to? The majority will then be of that religion, it will just be like how Buddhism and Jainism was subsumed by Hinduism. Such judges, show the poor quality of justices in our legal system, parochial and insecure. Caste system is drilled deep into this countries dna. There is nothing to bring back, Upper Caste hindus have all the power and people like you who have benefited want everyone to forget about or ignore what caste has laid waste in our country. We won't be 2.5 billion! We will peak at a max of 1.6 B and then start falling. How is it unrelated and how is it promoting division? Abolish caste system if you can. Ban everyone to use their last name. I am all for it. I am UC and would drop my last name tomorrow if indian govt let me. I can't even sign up online without last name. Lol. My comment is simply pointing out to fact that in India idea of minorities and majority are different from the world. Muslims are minority and yet they hold more power on narrative of \"minority issues\", had ruled India for centuries and hold significant wealth. UC hindus are minority and yet they hold more wealth and power over everything. Whereas the majority of indians are from LC and yet their issues are just vote bank politics. This is my direct comment on how the wrong idea of minorities is in India, even for HC judge. Must feel like pirouwad alumnis of whatsapp university. No the problem is forceful conversion,which has been happening for centuries. Any doubt in that? >ignore what caste has laid waste in our country. Surely i am not ignoring it if i am clearly publically opposing someone who speaks in a way to further the already fucked up distance between upper and lower castes. Are you one of those who think upper caste hindus should be killed or exiled from the country? Some fucked up people sure portray that as a form of \"liberalism\", murdering the very foundation of liberalism, how tragic. Fyi, hitler commited the holocaust because he thought the jews controlled everything and it was important to throw them out, we all know what happened afterwards. Don't support injustice to cope with existing injustice. Hindu mei sabko bhrahmin banado ....no conversion Of course, i too would drop this superficial heritage pride the moment i can, realising how bullshit it is. But I think that was completely unrelated and did not contribute to the discussion at hand. What it did promote was bringing in the topic of casteism in an unrelated discussion to further give opportunities to people who want to bark \"fuck lower castes\" and \"fuck upper castes\" yet again. Earlier these RWA uncles would hide behind the word \"forcible\" (as in \"only forcible conversions are wrong\"), now the mask is off and they are against all conversions, forcible or not. It is highly unlikely as with time, global population will reach saturation, and an overly populated country like india will reach saturation EVEN FASTER. Muslims won't suddenly become a majority and kill hindus because at one point, soon enough, population increases itself will become near impossible due to the lack of resources. You can read about population saturation if you are curious. How is forced conversion is even possible in a modern secular democratic country like India? I mean if it is about in a kingdom/dictatorship/religious country like Pakistan that is a valid concern And conversion to other religion is a basic right in any secular country and if a dalit who wants to convert becoz he fells he is being discriminated by his fellow religious people and wants to convert to other religion then who r u stop? And the same time who is stopping orange ppl from converting back to hinduism of those who is born in abrahamic religion? No one! It's just blatent fear mongering and nothing else If u r soo worried about minorities being overpopulating then u should bring a population control law for everyone that's the only viable solution In my opinion opposing discussion on caste is not the answer when the reality of caste discrimination is alive and well in India. Is the blatant discrimination much reduced than before, of course yes, but have the effects on those who have suffered centuries of deprivation and at par with the upper castes, NO. The attempts at equalizing the disparity must continue and even enhanced, this low hanging fruit reservation is hardly cutting it. What Hitler did is happening to muslims in India, blaming them for all of India's ills and calling them vermin and is not happening to any upper caste Hindu. Yep - in fact, the peak could be slightly lower. The concern is not about total population as much as it's about internal migration within the country + urbanization - can our existing cities sustain 3x more people? Do we need to plan and build out brand new cities? There never will cease to be a minority in any society. Religion is just one dimension - you have race, caste, class, community - the list is endless. This is simply divide and rule. Oh boy, you are gonna be so surprised to read about AIMPLB and waqf board. Judge Saab studied law, not math. Which community do you think is vocal against abortion and homosexuality on religious grounds in the US? Who made it mandatory in some states to teach one religious book and one religion's commandments and banned abortion even for high risk women in others? Some of them even bomb planned parenthoods and commit hate crimes against queer people. Conservative Christians in the US have been very much pushing for abolition of secular rule of law. Do you think the deeply conservative Christian countries in Europe are as secular in both laws and society as the ones with a lower percentage of conservative Christians? Do you think banning beef in states is secular? Do you think lynching people to death over suspicions of having it is? Do you think lower caste people still facing violent opression in several communities despite what the law says is not the signs of a community saying they can't live without their religious laws? Do you think the religion matters to an extremist? I think the Court is right this time. Considering there is little to no religious minority rights are exercised in India's immediate neighborhood which is predominantly Islamic:- Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan. It is an acknowledgement what happens to minorities in muslim majority country. So what happens in India if all religions are banned ? i wonder how much and how fast we will develop 🤔 How does one get \"converted\"? You get extra chromosomes or something? >but have the effects on those who have suffered centuries of deprivation been removed and now at par with the upper castes? NO And the only option way you decided to improve that is trash talking about every upper caste hindu? Doesnt sound like a real solution man. >this low hanging fruit \"reservation\" is hardly cutting it. Agreed, we need better policies, in the present reservation system is only increasing the distance if anything, reform is needed. What they should stop is the promoters and marketers who go around fooling people to convert just for the sake of conversion. If by some chance people find they are more attuned to different religion, then conversion is something of a personal matter and shouldn't be upto the government to decide. I've seen with my own eyes how coercive some people are, they tend to reach out at the most opportune time and guilt trip you into converting yourself. That's not moral or right by any sense. A person should only convert if they want a spiritual change! Not a social or economic change! That's where the line between good relegion and toxic institutional relegion blurs to nonexistent. Major reason why I lost faith in these \"centres\" of religion, and why i think it's for our own good if we lower the importance of one's religion in the political structure. And this only happens if education is progressed further, there's a huge lack of critical thinking skills built up in the nation. Children just churn the same answers like Xerox machines with little to no understanding of what it is or how it is applied in real life. It's these kind of children that grow up to be scholars, professors, doctors etc... Yet still be so deluded in the fictional world they do unholy acts of sacrificing their own children or heck even mass suicides. Also doesn't help the cream of the crop 99% of the time leave the country, where are our decades of iitians when the country needs them? What is the government doing to stop such life threatening amount of brain drain? Are we just spawn points for other countries to reap benefits out of? This communal politics is going to be the end of us smh... HC means the OBC/SC/ST/Dalits who support the Upper caste will become minority. Yes, Buddhists are only 0.7% of India's population. happens slowly muslims were 1 in 10 after partition now almost 1 in 6. gotto be pro-active. True!! Why Allahabad high court is always the one to make crazy remarks in things!! Following Religion is one’s personal choice. Neither the court nor the govt have any say in it. If someone tells me that his x religion is good and explains why it is good and if it satisfies my expectation then I will surely start to follow that religion. right? they are coming from WhatsApp university! England chale jao phir…😂😂 Yeah. It's easy for the majority to say \"common laws for all\" while forgetting that their culture became the law. It's only the other communities that need to change to match the laws that are basically based on your culture. in 1950 Hindu population and Muslim population was 84% and 10%. Now it is 80% and 14% respectively. Its only a change of 4%, how big of a difference you think it is upto you. For reference, 12.7% is the percentage of Indians that are BJP members who are above 18 and presumably pay a membership fee. There is probably more BJP members in India than muslim voters the threat of hindutva law is a million times bigger than sharia law lmfao Its slow encroachment of majority it absolutely threatening the security of India from 1 in 10 to 1 in 6. in Assam Hindus were 70% now to 60%. I'm personally a liberal in private life but this the main reason I vote for BJP. Population saturation kya hota hai sahi se batao Basically at one point the population will reach it's peak, in ecology we loosely call it the \"carrying capacity\" of the ecosystem, and us point ke aage population nahi badti, after that, it decreases (mostly of the poor, jinhe enough resources nahi milenge). So seeing that we are close to saturation already (less than 20-30 years i would guess), the muslim population simply can't become a majority. Considering they producing 3-4 kids normally, if muslims play among game like 300-400 years and slowly slowly increase population and be stable while saturation point, then again after some time (80-90 years )when population will become low the again start producing 3-4 kids , then the loop goes on ,( my English is weak . Hope you can understand what I am saying) ... So basically muslims can become majority practically after 500 years...lol 😂 500 years I don't even care now who becomes majority, minority I bet after 100-200 years whole world would be atheist or get nuked in Ww3 .. If you really want to engage in this then, India can end up like Malaysia which has robust protection for majority muslim malays similar thing can happen in india with bjp in charge that makes sure that hindus have constitutional protections. There's no such thing as hindutva law. hindutva law would be when undesired by BJP will be treated as second degree citizens by the law. i’m not even worried about that lol. it’s the fascist laws >I bet after 100-200 years whole world would be atheist or get nuked in Ww3 .. Tbh that's kinda real. Lekin bhai ek baat hai, tera point sahi hai that they can play the slow game, but yaad rakh ki muslim samaj isn't extreme case wealthy, jo log 4+ bachhe karte hai among muslims, they are often poor, and jab peak pe aake population giregi, to muslims ki percentage firse kam ho jayegi seeing current situation. As you said, its a cycle, mujhe nahi lagta boht ghambeer topic hai, mostly propaganda. No but it is a acknowledgment that ‘pretending’ to have minority status for claiming benefits, is bad What is the use of propagation if there is no conversion? Wtf are they on? can you be legible. what are the fascist laws? Kya karoge ye sab percentage ka. Batche nikal nikal ke competition kar rahe ho kya?? Quality matters not quantity. Aadhe se dash ke aadmi garib hain. Not getting even the basic amenities lekin sahib ko percentage , percentage khelna hain. Nikal le 20-30 bacche , for Hindu Hindu khelte reh. Caste census will fix this mindset. An upper caste judge saying that a lower caste man doesn't have the right to choose what is best for him. Absolutely ridiculous. Tbh, the majority in India has been on a decline since independence and hopefully is all converted soon. At least then there is a chance of unity in this country, something this country has lacked for thousands of years. Religion in general is bad for society. But religious conversion is especially despicable. It turns a native population against itself. As an aetheist I find natives that are converted to a different religion to be the most divisive to society. We have the deadly religious divides in the sub continent but even worse is the residential schools in North America. People will argue about freedom of speach and how anti conversion cannot be enforced. Agreed unfortunately. But as an aetheist I can say while many religious practices across religions are despicable, conversion is especially vile. Isn't this the court that gave RaGa prison sentence for \"criminal defamation\" ? read the first line again about undesirables Lol and how do you think Hinduism spread in India? Freedom of religion is a very modern concept. Why can't muslims, hindus, christians, atheists and everyone else coexist peacefully. It's so simple why complicate it. Imagine how beautiful our nation would be. Please do flush your mind and come out with an open and clear view. If religion is banned many people will lose their purpose and we may see high suicide rate which is also a win considering our population. By \"now\", do you mean 2011? This is a weird take especially as an atheist. If you are an atheist, wouldnt you encourage people to question religion? The whole \"anti conversion\" take makes it sound like you discourage that. Wouldn't being an atheist make you a divisive part of an otherwise religious society? wouldn't that sometimes lead you to reject your own culture? Forced conversions are not okay but people should be free to change their religion when they want to whatever it is. Sadly, india is so religious that being an atheist and not having a religion isnt recognised. I think it's more of an acknowledgement that sharia laws could become a reality for Indians in the future. Most conversions are forcible, deceitful or done with a purpose to find loopholes in laws. For ex. Forcible conversion of Hindus in Pakistan, deceitful conversion of Dalits to Christianity by giving them rice bags, ppl converting to Islam to marry multiple times, ppl converting to Christianity to get benefits in Catholic schools, etc. Voluntary conversions are far rarer, why would anyone suddenly have a conscience to convert into another religion? Therefore, simply using conversions is fair Religion includes belief in God, traditions, culture. As an aetheist I am opposed to the belief in a certain type of God. But traditions, culture and other aspects of heritage that gives meaning to society are all good. As for conversion it is as bad as caste if not even worse since it implicitly permits people to hate on others and even kill others. Also implicit in conversion is going against your own traditions and culture of your ancestors and the land. This is why it has been a tool of war and colonization. It is fair to say while a physical presence and keeping puppet government have been instrumental in colonizing the he land conversion by the western religions is colonizing the mind. I am ok with religions as long as they get rid of God and and are ok with others beliefs... Within reason. An atheist is someone who doesnt believe in the existence of god. Its not about what type of god you believe in. Traditions include a lot of aspects of religion. You wouldn't really take part in traditions like that unless you wanted to fit in with society and exclusively like the social aspect of it. Also idk what you mean by western religion. Almost all religions originated in asia. There arent any religions that get rid of god. All major religions are centered on a concept of god. Its so drastic to say that someone who converts to another religion hates everyone else and want to kill them. This sounds like fear mongering. I would rather have no religion as it creates conflicts even if you had one religion they would find a way to fight against it. God is defined in various ways. All the way from a God who keeps an eye on things and disbursed judgement to a spiritual variety where it is a name given to the nature of things. I am against the former and have no qualms with the latter. Western religion are organized religions mainly Abrahamic religions. Eastern ones are the ones originating in India and China. People underestimate the deleterious effects of conversion. I am pointing out that it is as bad as caste system if not worse. Especially for Indians it is important to recognize it and take steps to combat it just like you do the caste system. You have paid a heavy price for it already and will keep paying for it unless your society takes appropriate steps. To escape the Hindu caste system? Most conversions in India that are voluntary whether that is to Buddhism, Christianity, or Islam ..... Are oppressed castes, especially Dalits... Ambedkar converted and led a mass conversion... It was all voluntary..... Tum clown ho kya? Jao history padho bewakoof I was hoping the title would end like “…. , says BJP xyz bla bla bla”. Fucking High Court. This country is COOKED. History padhne ka to pata nhi pr real life experience se keh rha hu , agar 80% indian muslims ki history padhi hoti to pata hota ki unke grandfathers Hindus the jo forcibly converted the. In Karnataka why Brahmins are becoming christians to escape hindu caste system ? Lmao absurdist Only if we find oil. I am just baffled why are they able to hold their positions despite such statements. Who is policing the police? That too from WhatsApp Vishwavidyalay They must get the best weed around there I think, that's prob what they're smoking when they come up with these things New sub r/extraXindia This is like saying “you have the right to criticize the government, but not to vote for a different one” please do tell what happens to minorities in muslim countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and so on??? You may not want to accept it mate but India is a major shithole for minorities, much more than many Muslim countries. Time to wake up and smell the fucking gobbar. Caste system. India me kaunsa minority rights hai? The whole Indian subcontinent is a shithole of misogynist religious assholes. Let's stop pretending like India is not a gutter society just because it doesn't fit your nationalist sentiments. The pace at which Indians are lynching minorities, bulldozing their homes and violating and dehumanising them milord, India's majority population will perform their own holoc@ust before that happens. i am sure you are the next gen already graduate and doing phd :) This caught me off-guard... I was referring to Allahabad and Gujarat HC mate Lol hindu atheists > deceitful conversion of Dalits to Christianity by giving them rice bags I don't see the deceit .... if people truly don't believe in their god enough to switch for monetary gains, more power to them. If they did, they'll take the bags and convert back when the bags stop. my apologies.! and you are right. No worries cheers :) Hindu Muslim Christian Martian etc, having too many kids in india should be harshly punished. Going by all the past judgements it is not surprising. 😆 There is no non muslim minority in Oman, Kuwait, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan etc. Those few christians were since roman time have reduced to lower single digit. Hindus if any, in these countries, are temporary workers visiting working. There official religion is islam. There is no word as majority muslim and secular. Just doesn't happen. One can't even fathom to demand equality. The people of the land, christians who lived there since roman have been largely converted, decimated or pushed out. Indonesia : [https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/indonesia/](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/indonesia/) Malaysia : Is on it's path of islamisation, Recently introduced aadhar type of cards with the religion stamped on it. Here is slightly detailed reading [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\\_in\\_Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Malaysia) (read Religious discrimination). It is getting there. Banning burqa doesn't mean shit. I'm talking about state of no muslim minorities, there are none. Good for them. It's like Pakistani govt is pushing against marriage within blood relatives. I mean good for them, but we know what they're. On the top of that you conveniently forgot Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives. We all know the state of Hindus/minorities in these countries. These are facts without any name calling. Counter with facts not adjectives and adverbs. So? \"Counter with facts\" You realize it's not a strong suit for these parallel history nutjobs, right? Atleast we are allowed to exist. \\s Me searching for people going on a rampage killing Ex Muslims. > 404 not found Then you arent really an atheist. Thats just a different concept for god which makes a believe in spirituality which is completely okay. Thank you for reminding me about the definitions there. i havent heard anyone used the term eastern and western religion in a long time so i forgot about that. Everyone on earth was converted to a form or religion or left another religion for hundreds of years. There are religions that evolved into new forms or some that died out. Its just how life works in the grand scheme of things and how it will continue to work. What appropriate steps are you referring to exactly? Have you heard of buying votes by giving alcohol and money? If someone can buy your vote, why can't they make innocents convert? Also, it's not just rice bags, they pretend to be fake doctors who claim to cure you if you convert into Christianity. How do you think swathes of people in the northeast were converted during british rule? What is conversion in your eyes ? Do you think once you declare yourself \"convert\" you lose the rights to pray to the god you believe in ? These innocents think that Jesus has cured them; while they were actually cured by modern medicine, and then they start worshipping Jesus. Officially, the religion is recorded only during census. So in 2001 if you were a Hindu and in 2011 you suddenly become a christian, you are officially converted. The other way is to advertise yourself in the govt gazette. This is a bug industry - happens in North America too, where I work. I find ppl distributing bible pamphlets in extreme heat and extreme cold, and talking to passer-bys about how they should believe in the bible and all... next time when I have time, I want to recite the Bhagwad Gita to them. 😂 Absolutely killed it I am an upper(!) caste Hindu myself but I can understand how lower castes were treated even some 30 years ago. I can see that most maids and labourers are lower caste and their children find it very hard to break out of their cycle of deprivation, even if they try very very hard. If you cannot face the reality of what upper castes have done historically and how those effects continue as an endless cycle of poverty, you are covering your head in the sand. None of your relatives will ever work as a laborer (one exception won't change reality for the rest). This is reality, you don't have to take it personally. Reservation has failed because we have been unable as a country to provide meaningful opportunities to our people. > These innocents think that Jesus has cured them; while they were actually cured by modern medicine Such forms of quackery does need to be stopped specifically, but since our government has dedicated ministry that peddles what is essentially the same level of bullshit .... they are in no mood to stop any of it. This isn't special to christianity though - many babas also partake in fake healing and people in general do believe in the power of gods to heal them. Yes, many babas engage in the same level of quackery Time to file a lawsuit on my parents for forcing me to be a Hindu from birth. No, that's your imagination. Many minority groups are happy in India."
