Please mordertor don't remove this üôèü•∫\n\nI know you're gonna call me moron for what I did(gave OTP on open box) and I know I'm stupid because this was my first experience purchase. It's alot of money for my family and mom is crying her eyes out.\n\nProof in twitter:-\n[twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19)\n\nHere is story: I need your help. I ordered Macbook M1 from a website called as Flipkart. The price of laptop was 76000 rupees(on sale)\n\nOur initial order delivery date was 13th of August, but delivery guy did not pick up our call. On 15th of August he finally picked up our call. He asked us to come to Flipkart delivery hub, to receive our package because it will take him to more days to deliver our order.\n\nFor your information the item came under open delivery rule. That means you have to open the order before giving the OTP to delivery boy. The item also came under no refund policy, as it was an open box delivery.\n\nWhen we reached to the Flipkart hub. The delivery guy asked us to give OTP before opening the order and said it is a Flipkart protocol to get OTP before you can open your order. We gave him the OTP thinking that it's Flipkart rule. (I know I am dumb. You can call me that and even worse. I'm crying since th day). Delivery guy told us it's Flipkart Protocol, I have never ordered anything and laptop was for college. Everybody said I'm naive to order it from Flipkart I know! It was 14000 rs cheaper and it's alot of money for middle class family like me.\n\nAfter he took our OTP, he opened the box. When we saw inside there were some cheap speakers, cost of the speaker was 3000. We received a wrong and cheap order.\n\nPlease retweet ü•∫\n[twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19)\n\n\nWe have few proof that I would like to state: I) We have the footage and evidence that we are standing in the Flipkart hub. ii) also capture the face of the Flipkart delivery executive. iii) we have footage of the delivery executive opening the box that means the delivery boy open the box and not us. Thearby eliminating the allegation that we mightve changed the item. iv) we took the confession of delivery boy admitting that we have received the wrong product. v) the cameras in the ekart hub might have captured the incident that the delivery guy ask us to give OTP before delivery our package. That means it was the delivery guy who asked us to give the OTP before handling us our package.(we also called him later and made him confess he took OTP first and recorded it)\n\nWe contacted the Flipkart authority. They denied giving us our refund as it came under no returns policy.\n\nI am new on Reddit. I do not know how it will help but please be my voice ‚ñ≤ I can show you proof. Idk if can attach two videos here, I'll try! Please retweet my tweet A\n\nIdk how to send both link and video at the same time!\n\nCan you please retweet my tweet? I have provided video proof there\n\n(After posting tweet it doesn't send the Post) I'll give Twitter link in comments)\n\nI'm sending Twitter link to everyone in case they wanna help .\n\n[twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19)\n\nEdit: thank you for all your support ‚ù§Ô∏è how can I ever pay gratitude to y'all for support? Thank you for all retweets and likes. and no Flipkart did not offered a refund yet but I see them being in pressure.\n\nYou all asked me for seller name it's :- TREASURE HAUL ONLINE\n\nEDIT:\nYAYYYYYYYY FLIPKART CALLED ME FOR REFUND üíñü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ THANKS TO ALL OF YOU ü•∫üíñ\n\nI'LL POST AN UPDATE WHEN THEY'LL ACTUALLY SEND ME MONEY ON 28TH ü•∫üíñüíñüíñ",

Never has any delivery executive asked me otp before hand, in case of open box delivery. The instructions clearly says not to give OTP before checking the box. So it seems the delivery boy knew very well about the fraud. Or else he wouldn't ask you for OTP before.

        "This is my final reply I don't see a point in replying further.\n\nWhat the fuck is actually wrong with you? It's a suggestion, I didn't assume he has a credit card, i said if he paid by credit card he can file for a chargeback.\n\n\nThere are 3 methods of payment, by credit, debit or by cash. Usually a credit card has a huge discount on a product, so people ask their relatives/friends to use their credit card to order a product.\n\nEven right now the price of MacBook m1 is 81k on flipkart and with HDFC credit card you bring the price to 76k which is ops price.\n\n\nShut the fuck up about statistics when it doesn't play a role here. Unless op told he paid by debit, credit, or UPI you have to assume all 3 ways of payment are possible. If no one used credit cards then you would be right but a lot of people use them to order big purchases especially because the discount is so huge. \n\nYour stupid statistics \"argument\" can also be twisted \"how many middle class people can buy a MacBook, do you have statistics ü§ì\"",

The fact that it happened at a company warehouse where there is clear evidence that you were not handed the product you ordered is basically criminal negligence. This should be illegal.\n\nThe whole open box policy should be illegal as it involves Flipkart basically washing its hands off all the scams happening on its platform. It is telling the customer that dodging scammy sellers is your responsibility, not its own. That's fucking bullshit. Nowhere in the world does e-commerce work like this, heck even eBay which involves person-to-person sales has better consumer protection than this. I'm sure even buying knock-off items from AliExpress isn't as bad an experience (as long as you know what you are buying.)\n\nPersonally I have only ordered one thing from Flipkart in the past 3-4 years (I stick to Amazon). That was my Pixel 7 Phone since Amazon did not officially sell it. The whole experience was really annoying. The delivery agent unboxed the phone at my doorstep, peel off all the plastic wrapping and turn it on. Then they had to take four-five photos of the unboxed phone and fiddle with the touch screen before handing it to me and collecting the OTP. This might seem petty but it totally ruins the joy of unboxing a new piece of tech on your own and booting it up for the first time. On the flipside I recently bought a Macbook Air from Apple's online store and it was shipped via Bluedart. No hassles at all. Item was delivered in a tamperproof package, OTP was collected and I unboxed the thing peacefully at my own leisure a few hours later.",

At that point buying through FK Assured seller over a non-fulfilled Amazon seller was simply more trustworthy.

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I know this isn't the correct subreddit. But it's r/india and only place I can get help. Please mordertor don't remove this üôèü•∫ I know you're gonna call me moron for what I did(gave OTP on open box) and I know I'm stupid because this was my first experience purchase. It's alot of money for my family and mom is crying her eyes out. Proof in twitter:- [twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19) Here is story: I need your help. I ordered Macbook M1 from a website called as Flipkart. The price of laptop was 76000 rupees(on sale) Our initial order delivery date was 13th of August, but delivery guy did not pick up our call. On 15th of August he finally picked up our call. He asked us to come to Flipkart delivery hub, to receive our package because it will take him to more days to deliver our order. For your information the item came under open delivery rule. That means you have to open the order before giving the OTP to delivery boy. The item also came under no refund policy, as it was an open box delivery. When we reached to the Flipkart hub. The delivery guy asked us to give OTP before opening the order and said it is a Flipkart protocol to get OTP before you can open your order. We gave him the OTP thinking that it's Flipkart rule. (I know I am dumb. You can call me that and even worse. I'm crying since th day). Delivery guy told us it's Flipkart Protocol, I have never ordered anything and laptop was for college. Everybody said I'm naive to order it from Flipkart I know! It was 14000 rs cheaper and it's alot of money for middle class family like me. After he took our OTP, he opened the box. When we saw inside there were some cheap speakers, cost of the speaker was 3000. We received a wrong and cheap order. Please retweet ü•∫ [twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19) We have few proof that I would like to state: I) We have the footage and evidence that we are standing in the Flipkart hub. ii) also capture the face of the Flipkart delivery executive. iii) we have footage of the delivery executive opening the box that means the delivery boy open the box and not us. Thearby eliminating the allegation that we mightve changed the item. iv) we took the confession of delivery boy admitting that we have received the wrong product. v) the cameras in the ekart hub might have captured the incident that the delivery guy ask us to give OTP before delivery our package. That means it was the delivery guy who asked us to give the OTP before handling us our package.(we also called him later and made him confess he took OTP first and recorded it) We contacted the Flipkart authority. They denied giving us our refund as it came under no returns policy. I am new on Reddit. I do not know how it will help but please be my voice ‚ñ≤ I can show you proof.

Consumer court will take 3 to 6 months and I paid by UPI. I've already started a case in consumer court. They're not responding. The Flipkart You can easily get this resolved.

Do you live in an alternate universe? Maybe its his parents creditcard. Are you stupid mate? He could have used his parents credit card to order it. A lot of times people use others credit cards to order stuff to avail discounts on Flipkart, Amazon. How many middle-class middle-aged parents have credit cards? Do you have statistics? ***Are you stupid \"mate\"?*** Flipkart is running big scam or something you are not alone just check in r/IndiaGaming community Flipkart review. Also post this on r/IndianGaming. Thank you so much üôèü•∫ It says ita a private community Your life is worth more than 76k and on a lighter note ajkal ek kidney itself can fetch about 4 to 5 lakhs üåö Post this on twitter, tag Flipkart higher authorities and some influencers. Make the tweet go viral by any means necessary! Once it's viral enough to hurt the image of Flipkart, they'll give you the full refund along with some extra! üòÇü§£ I've posted 5 tweet and tagged 50 people with news channel. Still no response You suspected a crime (defraud) happening to you at Flipkart center. You should have dialed 100 right then. It's strange people don't think of police. In most cases the moment police gets involved, the other party changes tone. Flipkart would have wanted to resolve it as soon as possible. Calling 100 for assistance is not a crime when you feel honestly that your have been duped. No other option than consumer court..you can't even blame Flipkart here, when they have especially brought open delivery thing to put a stop to this kind of frauds. Also, threaten that delivery executive too with a case of fraud. Never has any delivery executive asked me otp before hand, in case of open box delivery. The instructions clearly says not to give OTP before checking the box. So it seems the delivery boy knew very well about the fraud. Or else he wouldn't ask you for OTP before. Some delivery people themselves are removing original products by clever opening of the packing.. mention to him that in your consumer complaint as well as police complaint you are mentioning his name too along with Flipkart. Thank you üôè Everyone is saying that. We filed a case on him aswell. He said sorry I didn't knew. This is my final reply I don't see a point in replying further. What the fuck is actually wrong with you? It's a suggestion, I didn't assume he has a credit card, i said if he paid by credit card he can file for a chargeback. There are 3 methods of payment, by credit, debit or by cash. Usually a credit card has a huge discount on a product, so people ask their relatives/friends to use their credit card to order a product. Even right now the price of MacBook m1 is 81k on flipkart and with HDFC credit card you bring the price to 76k which is ops price. Shut the fuck up about statistics when it doesn't play a role here. Unless op told he paid by debit, credit, or UPI you have to assume all 3 ways of payment are possible. If no one used credit cards then you would be right but a lot of people use them to order big purchases especially because the discount is so huge. Your stupid statistics \"argument\" can also be twisted \"how many middle class people can buy a MacBook, do you have statistics ü§ì\" We found out very late that it was open box delivery when Flipkart explained what it was. I went to file case in police they said, he has CCTV of 4 days from parcel coming and parcel going. They asked him but he's denying \"76,000 ka laptop mangaya par nikla sasta speaker. Flipkart ka scam\" Go to your local thana and get the complain done as it become an official and legal. That itself will escalate the matters in the local Ekart/Flipkart level. Also Go to your local newspaper office. You have the pics. Local newspapers like these kinds of new. Consumer court bhi ja. Unlike other courts consumer courts are better and you don't even need a lawyer. Also keep tagging relevant authorities on twitter and make a longform post in FB as well tagging your state Police DGP, CM etc etc I ordered an iPad pro with apple pencil, from Flipkart. Post order confirmation, it was specifically mentioned in site regd open box delivery. The guy came to my home, unboxed in front of me and even turned on the device, while I recorded everything. Only then I gave the OTP. You should've been more cognizant, since a lot if people end up with Rin Soap bars, while ordering phones I've done everything! I've went to police par unhone kaha he has cctv as proof in office he didn't steal . Consumer court me case dala.they said 4 months lag sakte hai Yes I know üòì this was my first expensive item. He said it's protocol and I wasn't tech savvy Hmm I've ordered laptops from these places before and it wasn't ideal (damaged keyboard) but it at least was the right item Considering that organ donation for money is illegal they will keep the money and your kidney and leave you with complications for life. Bro, I recently got scammed for 2,64,588. I understand your situation but suicide isn't the solution. You'll earn it back, giving up your life isn't the answer There are some ways to solve this problem, lol, go to consumer court, Find that delivery boy which it gon be easy, get his ass real good I know him I recorded him he said nit ny Life lesson - Never purchase high value items on flipkart. Have heard way too many incidents like these. Amazon/ offline is the way to go. is Amazon better? Please raise a grievance on PMO portal. Please raise multiple concerns on all possible consumer forums of government Even Amazon is not safe nowadays Just buy offline Croma mostly matches the online prices Flipkart open box delivery is a joke... why should customers ensure that the right product is being delivered... they take zero responsibility whatsoever üòí I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Here's a tweet suggestion for you to post on twitter: \"Absolutely gutted and furious! Just got scammed out of Rs. 76,000 by a @Flipkart delivery guy. Your delivery executive manipulated us to provide OTP before opening the box. I found cheap speakers instead of the MacBook M1 I ordered. @Flipkart @flipkartsupport, this is NOT okay! My family's hard-earned money is gone, and we're shattered. Your delivery executive played a part in this, and I've got evidence ‚Äì videos, photos, confession! Middle-class families rely on your platform, and this is how we're treated? Unbelievable! @StatePolice, I hope you're watching. #FlipkartScam #JusticeNeeded\" Tweet this and tag your state police where I have written @StatePolice. Bhai tu alag level ka chootiya hai. Why are you not at the gates of your local district magistrate and thana? Why is this not appearing in newspapers? You think newspapers won't take this, those fuckers are dying for non political contents! Heck you could even involve local politicians in this, especially their trade wings! 'i have nowhere to go but r/India' r/india should have been where you come after doing all this. Tum naive nahi ho bhai, actually bevakoof ho. Bhai reddit par kitni baar mana kiya hai flipkart se expensive saman mangwane ko. Chal ab shant hoja. Jo ho gaya so hogaya. Aage se dhyaan rakhna Bhai wha bhi daal diya It's definitely a devastating situation for anyone belonging to the middle-class. Try reaching the executive of flipkart regarding, if they didn't say anything try to reach with another agent on flipkart. And tell them your situation with each and every detail possible. They will surely do something [in reference](https://www.flipkart.com/pages/open-box-delivery-tnc#:~:text=In%20case%20you%20find%20the,the%20time%20of%20the%20delivery%3F) It's a famous comment so I'm adding Twitter link please retweet üôèü•∫ you are all the sweetest [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19) Always buy expensive things at the official store be it watches, laptops and shoes or expensive cosmetics. I too used to say the same about police until I too got into a scam and filed a complaint into cyber cell office. They took it so lightly that after my 4-5 visits to the cyber cell they started saying \"aap abhi yahan aana band karo, hum investigate kar rhe hain\" . It's been 2 months and no response since then.

Not worth my life. According to their policy, once OTP is given and product is found to be wrong, then you are free to return it for a full refund. If cash paid, it'll be refunded immediately. If online payment, it'll take few processing days. Talk to Flipkart customer service and get it returned. If unfavourable, approach consumer court. You'll get your money back for sure. I got scammed of Rs. 7,50,000/- That's all my saving but that's alright I can earn it back. Not worth my life. They said no.

Please file a case and claim a crore at least. Flipkart must compensate for your mental breakdown I am not making this up, but I am one of the people who actually received a Rin soup bar when I ordered an iPhone 6 long time back. But it was Amazon instead of Flipkart. I ordered an iPad pro with apple pencil, from Flipkart. Post order confirmation, it was specifically mentioned on site regd open box delivery. #give OTP only after verifying box contents The guy came to my home, unboxed in front of me and even turned on the device, while I recorded everything. Only then I gave the OTP. OP should've been more cognizant, since a lot of people end up with Rin Soap bars, while ordering phones File in consumer court. That will set fire under them. They will come running to you to resolve the matter. File against both flipkart and delivery service. Later don't settle just for product. If needed take legal help. Bhai tujhe therapy ki sakth zarurat hai. Being supportive doesn't require one to be financially rich. Seriously, you need to seek help. I know you won't accept it but phir bhi bolunga.

Rejoin school. This will boost your resume, you need to give reasons for break years . If you say you took a break year to pay off this , HR interviews lap this shit up . Guess it must be mandatory for 90% of the civil servants to be a bunch of clowns ü§° All this advice, but where is Op? Fir is the only option.

You file an FIR against Flipkart and give a copy of your evidence to the police along with the complaint. Ensure you have the complete set of evidence with you as well and don't blindly give it off to police without keeping copies. After that, approach the consumer court and file a complaint with a copy of the FIR and evidence. Whatever you're doing do it legally so that nothing goes against you later on. This process will take time but that's the only option you have. Fight for your rights immediately. The longer you take to initiate the legal process, the more diluted your issue will become. So act fast. If you don't, you can't get your money back. Go to any local newspaper to get your story published. Try to reach out to them on Twitter etc Make a complaint [here](https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/), there are multiple avenues mentioned. Record all your calls with Flipkart customer support. Also, email the video proof here: [grievance.officer@flipkart.com](mailto:grievance.officer@flipkart.com), [cs@flipkart.com](mailto:cs@flipkart.com), [cs-head@flipkart.com](mailto:cs-head@flipkart.com) and mention that if they don't help you out, you'll be getting in touch with dept of consumer affairs. Just find some mail ids of all media handles online and just mail dump to everyone I hope you have at least contacted the Police. Should be the first thing to do when you are a victim of a crime. First incident report becomes the basis for any further action. I would also suggest to post on r/legaladviceindia And contact consumer guidance society of India if you feel Flipkart is being negligent.

It was flipkart person was wrong here as you can see usually they entry otp once you are ok üëç with it. As clearly it can be seen flipkart person mever entered or asked for otp. You should waited for them to deliver the laptop at home. 99.7% An advice to you, since I have gotten my money back from Flipkart through Twitter only. Don't write so many big tweets. In your main tweet, where problem is explained, Flipkart support is not being tagged. You have tagged them in separate tweet where you are demanding justice but the matter is not mentioned. Write matter in short and precise manner and tag Flipkart support in them. They will then reply you to explain the matter in detail in inbox. By writing so many tweets, with main problem not even visible in their tag, they won't be able to respond as there are many many people tagging them and it will get difficult for them to see the tag, come to your profile and then check out your other tweet where you are explaining the problem. Leave the other tweets as it is for better reach, but for now write a simple short tweet and tag only Flipkart support. They will reply immediately. To ALL FK is an organisation that lacks Accountability, specially High Ticket Item. We have seen this a lot on news, on Reddit too. hence treat FK for low ticket items or dont even use it. Hi Sorry to hear that and can understand this may not be easy, specially for you and family. Positive is that you are articulate hence firstly know this is addressable , to a certain extent. Hence you need to be smart and take control of this with Flipkart. (+ves) &#x200B; 1. In the Flipkart hub 2. Also capture the face of the Flipkart delivery executive. 3. have footage of the delivery executive opening the box that means the delivery boy open the box and not u 4. Video available confirming opening the package with different product 5. the confession of delivery boy admitting that we have received the wrong product 6. the cameras in the ekart hub might have captured the incident that the delivery guy ask us to give OTP before delivery our package (-ves) &#x200B; 1. Despite clear instructions, you provided the OTP before opening the package. 2. Delivery executive \"MANIPULATED\" you into thinking the OTP needs to be given before. &#x200B; My sugestions: &#x200B; 1. Stop being sad when have of the evidence is in your favour. Use it to build a case and make FK accountable. 2. Write a CLEAR MAIL with above points, share video .. On mail as well as Twitter. Ask for support from friends/ Reddit community and let all retweet. Some will, some won't. 3. Clearly state in email that while instructions were clear and you demanded to see the product from executive in their own warehouse , yet Flipkart executive \"MANIUPULATED\" you into believing that it is FK rule/policy to give code before product. ( Attach the video , hopefully voice recorded, if not , it is OK ) 4. Why FK executive asked you multiple times to see the CODE before product. Is he not trained or is he part of this scam. How is FK safeguarding customers from such behaviours where customers are \"MANIPULATED\" into giving codes before handover and product is wrong and FK says they aren't accountable. Clearly state is FK accountable or in this game as well , how can we be sure ? 5. Tell them and you MUST, Consumer court or police complaint with evidence and create a case. Tag senior leaders of Flipkart to your Tweet too. I think you'll have to be after them for your refund and a Police case or a news article must help you get this expedited. Good Luck. Sorry for your loss and its a shame what happened, flipkart is just a shit show these days NGL, but you mentioned you from a middleclass family and money is an issue, then why did you buy a macbook? you could have got a better and more powerful laptop in the 50-60K range and could have saved more. It cost me 76k.my mom said so, because she thinka for ones for my college I should buy something good. I've never purchased anything expensive because of financial condition. Since a good college is. A achievement she thought it'll be like a gift and I'll eatm alot after good college Here's the video of delivery boy opening and accepting I got scammed. Can you plz also repost it üôè [twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19) What are the steps to be vigilant? Post on LinkedIn too and Tag Flipkart Current officials. He did everything still in trouble. Check his tweet and retweet it so that it gets highlighted. Thank youüôèü•∫. I'll do that If I understand correctly, then someone sent you the wrong item and not the Flipkart hub, then I would suggest you raise a request to Flipkart and file a FIR. Bro never ever give OTP unless you‚Äôre satisfied. Hopefully you get your product or money. Good luck Consumer court is your best bet. Not exactly the same situation but my friend had an issue with Flipkart regarding one of the Samsung Galaxy flagship phone. It took around 2 months but he got all his money back. You‚Äôve all the required evidence so file the case asap and keep tweeting daily with videos etc Also tag tech youtubers like geekyranjit, he mentioned in a video where he too faced such issues with flipkart. I have stopped using flipkart ever since I saw that video, and so should everyone. 100 times better. Also use a credit card in future Isme suicidal kyu bhai Yeah bro, I'm sincerely sorry. Hope it gets better, or you learn to not let it affect how you treat other people ‚ù§Ô∏è Doesn't matter what they said. See their TnC. Whatever is written there is the source of truth. Send it to the customer care person and ask them to follow their TnC or you will take them to court for fraud. It said they can't return. Here's the video of delivery boy opening and accepting I got scammed. Can you plz also repost it üôè [twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19) Try getting in touch with your bank and see if they can raise a dispute for fraud from their side. Go to police. File a complaint at National Consumer Helpline. It is resolved within 2 weeks. I got scammed too I ordered Earbuds from Flipkart they gave me the shell but there were no earbuds inside it, they gave an empty circular thing no earbuds üò† That works for smaller transactions. Higher disputes companies will take up. Thank you so much! I'll do that I do want to call you an idiot. But not for providing that guy with an OTP but for paying 76k for a 3.5 years old MacBook. What else can I buy instead of a macbook? I just thought apple runs smoother Bad advice, police need chai Pani first then they agree to even listen. I've got some experience in this case . Don't ever post such things on social media . Each e- commerce team has their own social media team that handles such cases , they will directly reject your claim on such things . Don't buy expensive things from online websites even if it looks cheap these things are all scams . It is just a trick scam people and looks like you got scammed . The best thing you can do is now go to the consumer court and file a complaint . The attractive discounts are precisely the scam. Even more so Flipkart Assured now blocks any form of return, all assured products carry Open Box now and people have to be very very very very vigilant before giving OTP on open box. Take half hour, one hour to inspect, let the delivery guy wait. Only when these delays will hit Flipkart will they stop this bs. Yeah local ones won't even file cases of stalking, forget about money scams. Always use Amazon, and don't worry about the money. You can always earn it back. #fuckflipkart This is why you always buy online through a credit card. If anything goes bad, you just file for a chargeback. Your best bet is approaching the consumer court. There‚Äôs a low chance you‚Äôll get your money back but its still better than doing nothing. Sorry to hear what you‚Äôve gone through. Hope you get some kind of reimbursement. Its scams like this that made me leave India. India is developing with lightning fast speed but the core issues are still unsolved. What was the problem with Cultfit, facing an issue with them aswell This is what appears for OBD before final confirmation. The link you shared has not been updated since Dec 2022. Never use flopkart.com they even bought the domain flopkart coz they knew what they are. I bought an exercise cycle and after a month it started making noise. No amount of repair would fix it. They were like the next repair would be final, next repair will sort out the issue. Had to fight with them on the call and get the money back. i used croma online to buy a laptop, my experience was smoother than a baby's butt That delivery is guy is sketchy, he shouldn‚Äôt have asked for the otp first if he was genuine. [This] (https://imgur.com/0Bopph4) is what appears for OBD before final confirmation. The TnC linked before has no mention of it. lol. literally any decent windows laptop Don't worry you will get your money back!! Don't give up If it was OBD, [this popup](https://imgur.com/0Bopph4) would have appeared before final order placement. He goofed up if he didn't notice it. Not that it excuses Flipkart, their third term is beyond ridiculous from the get go. I would keep the executives wait for hours if I have to be 99% sure things are correct. Bhai retweet kiya hai. Agar refund vagera kuch hua toh yaha par bhi update kardena These scams are happening cause of last mile operations scams and.not from e-commerce portals. File a case against Flipkart and also against ekart. Also reach out to communities and try to get this viral against both these entities. Share as much as possible and probably in 7 days you should get a resolution from them. Try to involve as many people or just create fake social media accounts to spam the shit out of a single thread on as many platforms as possible. A spike in the numbers will hit their counters as well. Thank you bhaiya üíñ ü•∫ Thank you so much üíñüôè I'll follow your advice üíñü•∫ Please retweet if you can! Here's the video of delivery boy opening and accepting I got scammed. Can you plz also repost it üôè [twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19) I think you should tweet under FK‚Äôs latest tweets in their own account This is the way to get visibility and get a response Whatever their latest ads on twitter , just go to FK‚Äôs and post your tweets as comments / replies . I am so sorry this happens to you and others Since the company has become notorious for this , it was their responsibility to call purchasers of high value electronic item ( even if automated call ) and explain to them properly about open delivery procedure I agree üíñ‚ù£Ô∏è I'm not very informed about these things üòì I'll do as you said! Thank you so much üôèü•∫ Ok üôèüòì Sure. I saw your video and it's evident by the body language that this is done by ekart guy. Raise a consumer case against both and provide GSTIN number of the ekart delivery centre. Unke dhande pe attack kro and if possible raise a case in police with help of opposition or ruling leader. Twitter pe tag kro unko. I have worked in global fraud analytics in Amazon and I can tell this is a common fraud modus operandi over the world. Bro u living delusion life or what, even if ya DM and ask to share ur news, they will ask u to pay the money first You will get the money back. It's not a small amount. Court case takes time but you will not loose you money. keep as much proof as you can with you. I am so sorry this happened to you. Since you opened the package in their premise, you have sufficient proof and you should pursue this in consumer court if required. Try to lookup top executives on linked in and reach out to them if needed. Lastly, don‚Äôt beat your self to it. Happens to the best of people inspite of all the awareness. You will be fine. Since the launch of Amazon, I have never once ordered from any other Indian owned website. We simply don‚Äôt know how to business with integrity. This is why a lot of companies don‚Äôt want to come to India and setup business as we lack the business ethics, we are also in the west known for running scams and looting innocent people. Posed your question to AI and got the following response : Here is a summary and analysis of the Reddit post, along with suggestions for further actions: Summary: - The OP ordered a MacBook Air M1 from Flipkart for Rs. 76,000 - The delivery was scheduled for August 13th but was delayed - On August 15th, the delivery executive asked OP to collect the package from the Flipkart hub directly - At the hub, the executive asked for the OTP before letting OP open the package - After providing the OTP, OP discovered cheap speakers instead of the laptop they ordered - Flipkart is refusing a refund due to their no-returns policy on \"open box\" deliveries - OP is seeking help to escalate the issue and get a refund Analysis: - This seems like a clear case of fraud by the delivery executive who swapped the product after getting the OTP - OP is not at fault and provided evidence including CCTV footage and confession - Flipkart is not taking responsibility despite their protocol being violated - OP stands to lose a significant amount of money needed for college Suggested next steps: - Continue posting on Twitter with evidence and tag influencers, journalists, police authorities etc to raise visibility - Contact consumer court as already done and pursue the case actively - Try escalating further within Flipkart through emails/calls to senior management - Lodge an FIR against the delivery executive for fraud and swapping products - Consider approaching local newspapers/tv channels to highlight the issue - Post on other platforms like LinkedIn to directly engage Flipkart employees The key is to not give up and continuously pursue this from all angles until Flipkart is forced to intervene and provide a refund. Remaining persistent and raising visibility seems the best approach based on the information provided. Just give OTP after checking your product incase of Flipkart. For expensive device they tell you that do not give OTP before checking your product to counter these scams. it's not flipkart fault, 3rd party sellers doing scams, anyone can make seller account on amazon & flipkart. Always check who is seller before purchasing, like on amazon [Appario Retail Private Ltd](https://www.amazon.in/sp?marketplaceID=A21TJRUUN4KGV&seller=A14CZOWI0VEHLG&isAmazonFulfilled=1&ref_=dp_merchant_link&asin=B09QQPGDBG) & some others are official sellers. on flipkart omnitel retail, retailnet etc are genuine sellers. avoid new sellers, scam sellers are always new. i was seller on ebay from 2010 to 2013, Bro just go to consumer court , also keep proofs of contact no , prod purchased , bill etc Fuck flip kart Hmm that was a rookie mistake made by OP. I think the delivery executive is on the scam, he smartly forced them to give the OTP before unpacking and technically cleared himself of accountability afterwards. If it was Flipkart you will need to sleep there for 4 days to get something done. Cyber cell service is better. Yes true, but given we know about these scams, we can continue using Flipkart and safeguard ourselves by not making the same mistakes. Although this solution is not a good enough fix, given we don't see much of such incidents with amazon and Flipkart should fix this issue 99.72% > ***I'm broken and suic\\*dal.*** This part is worrying. Please do not worry. This may waste some of your time but I believe you have sufficient evidence to get your money back. Just keep at it. 76k meri 3 mahine hi salary h Your life is not worth 3 months salary, I lost money that I will probably never recoup again. It wasn‚Äôt even my money I wasted. Guilt bahot hai but suicide is not the solution. PMO portal? I am really curious about people's reactions to problems on this subreddit. I am sorry that you got scammed, it can be a very harrowing experience, but are you really \"broken\" or are you really \"suicidal\"? It's a laptop, even if you are scammed and you don't get the money back. What really is your loss? It's not as if you paid for a life saving medicine or anything of that sort? Obviously fight Flipkart, and I hope you get your money back - but please learn to contexualise problems, that might help as well. Flipkart sucks Thank you , idk it's such a precise proof why are they not helping me I have delivery guy confessiom too, and camera recording too if ekart hub that I'm ready to give to them Here's the video of delivery boy opening and accepting I got scammed. Can you plz also repost it üôè [twitter ](https://twitter.com/atharva_1913/status/1693503663929807035?t=dJrhn3nGh-3FYOg-rn5HWw&s=19) I have observed if something is taking more time than expected its usually wrong product or the seller doesn't have that item. I recently ordered an expensive cream at abnormal discount from amazon which delayed and arrived after 10 days and there was some expired cheap cream inside. Though I called amazon and they told me for few pics and got refund within 2 hours and told me to keep that cheap cream with me too. Flipkart seller here: The Flipkart (Ekart) delivery offices are full of cctv cameras. So if it was stolen inside office it would be captured. My recommendation: File a police complain and go with police officer to Flipkart office. The manager may allow you to check cctv footage alongside them. Otherwise this will put pressure on flipkart as well as Flipkart office. Now about twitter. Tag CEO, Walmart, Walmart CEO and everyone at top related to Flipkart. But do FILE FIR first. Ye to jyada bada fraud nikla Again I wanna emphasise that please for the love of god don‚Äôt buy anything from flipkart. Those people have zero ethics and care for customers. Shouldn't the delivery guy upload pictures of the item you purchased on their app in case of open box delivery, isn't that the procedure? I don't buy from Fk often but I ordered something for the first time last week which had open box policy. The guy asked me for OTP before opening the delivery. But I too was stupid enough to share it with him before he could open the box (I'm not familiar with fk delivery procedures since I order from amz when I buy online). I realized it was dumb only after I shared it with him but luckily the item was all good. But I did notice him taking pictures of the product from every angle after unboxing to upload on the app. Didn't the delivery guy do that in OP's case? That should be a proof for you not having delivered the actual product right? I am definitely going to be the asshole here but if 76k was a life or death amount for OP, buying a MacBook should have been the least of his priorities. There are many windows laptops for cheaper options. Damn. Feeling really sorry for you. Flipkart just seem to be hitting new lows everyday I agree but suicide is not a solution even if his priorities are wrong Always buy expensive things offline (i traveled to another city to buy a laptop) While recording always record in wide angle and in full resolution with fully lit light or use flash if required Make sure delivery boy is face is visible Turn down background noise for example tv, speaker song when recording Speak time and date and product name in recording If you have proof. And you did nothing wrong. Time to fight and not be a scared of anything. It‚Äôs your money and they scammed you. You have every right to escalate the matter. And 76k is a small amount, it will be refunded. I‚Äôve seen people loose their savings over a flat built on bogus papers. I had a bad experience on amzn few years ago where I received empty box for a laptop purchase. The order wasn't amzn fulfilled either. But I received the refund after a week long of calls and emails. After receiving the refund, I purchased it again from amzn itself but this time a fulfilled product. amzn imo takes care of their customers' issues at least from my experiences. They scratched my ass with sandpaper You can also try to check who the seller is. Find out the seller, get the contact details and add them to your case too. Yep, if it's such a large amount for him, and can't afford to lose then shouldn't have bought MacBook. Even I require laptop for my work and can't afford good one so using window Keep us updated with the situation, we gotta make sure this doesn't happen to others as well. I have ordered a few things from Flipkart and this open box thing they do is truly nerve wrecking. We have to make sure that not just you get recompensated, but also Flipkart to change their anti consumer policies. See if you can use any local area supporters with you to the police station and request to view the footage. Smells like underhanded money exchange. Amazon is also scam - scammers who quit flipkart are joining amazon . I would advise people to buy offline purchase anything above 2000 rupees. It's always \"a nice laptop\" = Mac. This lazy and simp thinking is disgusting. This contradicts a lot of other people who have had success through social media. It's worth trying at least for a month, for this much money, before giving up. Post this on LinkedIn. Sensationalize it. It'll reach to the higher ups and you'll get a resolution. Flipkart's ekart logistics is run by local Mafia and gundas. You purchased an Apple Mac, got scammed and now you are suicidal? As someone who has dealt with a suicidal person, either get yourself to a therapist if you are that unstable or (more likely) don't hyperbole and take words like suicidal /depression in vain? Flipkart openbox delivery means they need to open it while recording it and if the item is not correct it is not on you. You should get your money back or a replacement. Have courage and be calm for now. Get recording from Flipkart hub of your unboxing report it to consumer complaints and go to cyber crime office and file a fir against seller Seller address can be found in invoice if you can't ask local ca or someone who work in it to help you identify who owns that gst number your money is safe you don't need to worry File case on seller rather than Flipkart and ask him to give you not only laptop but compensation of mental health damage if you file complaint against Flipkart it will take months even if you go to court there will be atleast 10-15lawyer standing in front of you From Flipkart r/LegalAdviceIndia 99.75% wtf why are you scolding him for buying a MAC. Either way he would have lost 50 to 60k A ThinkPad would have been far, FAR better, and you can use both Windows and Linux on it comfortably. It is also more durable, has better keyboard and officially allows user repairability with manual, along with multiple ports. File a case of cheating Money, its all about his hard earned money. Many people feels the same. Work and save for months to spends on our wishes just to go down the drain. Media don't give a rat's ass about scams. There are so many, it's just routine day-to-day life. Now if there was a sex-scandal involved somehow.. Retwitting bhai I understand what you‚Äôre going through. Don‚Äôt be too harsh on yourself I just don't understand why people keep purchasing Apple products from third party sellers. There are two physical Apple stores now where you can pick up genuine products - direct from the manufacturer. Or you can order online direct from them. Why involve a scammy third party like FK? Honestly, consumer forum is your only option left. Or hire a lawyer and send a legal notice to Flipkart First of all, anyone telling you that this is somehow your fault for sharing the OTP before opening the box can fuck right off. It's not your fault that a scam like this is so frequent on Flipkart. The fact that it happened at a company warehouse where there is clear evidence that you were not handed the product you ordered is basically criminal negligence. This should be illegal. The whole open box policy should be illegal as it involves Flipkart basically washing its hands off all the scams happening on its platform. It is telling the customer that dodging scammy sellers is your responsibility, not its own. That's fucking bullshit. Nowhere in the world does e-commerce work like this, heck even eBay which involves person-to-person sales has better consumer protection than this. I'm sure even buying knock-off items from AliExpress isn't as bad an experience (as long as you know what you are buying.) Personally I have only ordered one thing from Flipkart in the past 3-4 years (I stick to Amazon). That was my Pixel 7 Phone since Amazon did not officially sell it. The whole experience was really annoying. The delivery agent unboxed the phone at my doorstep, peel off all the plastic wrapping and turn it on. Then they had to take four-five photos of the unboxed phone and fiddle with the touch screen before handing it to me and collecting the OTP. This might seem petty but it totally ruins the joy of unboxing a new piece of tech on your own and booting it up for the first time. On the flipside I recently bought a Macbook Air from Apple's online store and it was shipped via Bluedart. No hassles at all. Item was delivered in a tamperproof package, OTP was collected and I unboxed the thing peacefully at my own leisure a few hours later. > I paid by UPI. That's the other mistake. Always pay for expensive goods with a credit card - one of the well known international chains. They usually have good fraud protection built in. what was the price and which variant ? The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), India is a quasi-judicial commission in India which was set up in 1988 under the Consumer Protection. TAKE UP THE MATTER WITH THE ABOVE AGENCY. There's no way to soften the blow OP. You ARE in for a long fight. Better convince yourself now. Don't think of getting your money immediately. Keep a cool head and keep trying as many avenues as you can \\- From my observations, the box was sealed loosely- doesn't seem to happen when they deliver a product like a laptop, it was clearly done by the delivery agent (or someone involved in the freight) and he must have known about the policy that once he gets the OTP, he would get a freehand in this crime. They mention it several times to only give OTP **after** inspecting the product. I >He said it's protocol and I wasn't tech savvy Hate to break it to you, then its totally on you. You trusted the delivery guy over written instructions by the company. And I don't think you have any claim over flipkart too, if you choose to ignore the instructions. Consumer grievances will surely respond. Lure of discounts I myself did order my laptop through flipkart during 2019's bbdays, I was lucky that in those days we used to have return or refund policy, unlike present's open box delivery. Now in the upcoming bbdays I am to order another one for my sister, am skeptical this time due to flipkart's shenanigans. yeah. scam is bad and company should pay through nose but macbook could also have fallen from hand and broke. how could someone spend money on MacBook if they go suicidal if it doesn't work Hey. First relax, take a deep breath. Your case will 100% be solved. It's clearly a genuine case based on your video evidence. It's a big company and whenever such cases have happened the buyer does manage to get a refund. I can see FK social media team has already replied to you saying that they are looking into it. One other suggestion is to post this on LinkedIN and tag some of the folks at FK. Especially head of social media and head of marketing. I can definitely see your issue will get resolved. Consumer court is your only option. Take a printout of the order from the Flipkart website and show it to them. Also, show the item received. This is why amazon is better than Flipkart any day of the week. Please provide a number or a website link for National Consumer Helpline. Another lesson you've learned here is know what you're buying, if you don't ask someone who does. Research the product and the website/seller. If you had asked someone who knows things regarding such expensive products they would have first advised against buying from Flipkart and second advised against buying a macbook for college. Now all you can do is hope the courts can help you, and make sure to highlight the delivery centre/people in everything Never buy anything from Flipkart exactly. It literally comes as a popup and mentions no returns for any case once OTP is provided Hey, can you please go to your filpkart order section and also mention the name of seller in your posts? This might also put some pressure on seller Seriously I wonder the age of people advising and upvoting this police, journalists and news channel route. None of them will care for a scam around a 1000$ 4yr old device. They earn more through bribes and ads every hour. Only Consumer complaint or lawyering up will have a realistic result. In OP's case reading the three line popup that comes up just before payment which specifically mentions to provide OTP after satisfaction, and also that no returns will be possible after OTP. You take a screenshot of the seller's name and update your post so that others can be aware. example &#x200B; Yes it's my seller. How do you know? Won't involving the police work ? I mean they can find the seller and solve the issue right? MAC bros tend to not do basic research on any of their purchases, apple or otherwise. It's exceptionally fitting with OP ignoring the three simple sentences that pops up on Flipkart opendelivery before making payment and did the opposite for all the three. He is lucky he has some semblence of proof that implicates Flipkart with its representative not following their own terms. it should be renamed scamkart n not flipkart Just to give you an example, I searched for a MacBook M1 on Flipkart and found it. The seller has a good rating. Maybe the delivery guys scammed you. If you're middle class, how you failed to do basic research before spending your significant money is beyond me. It applies for both the choice for Mac and failing to read the three simple sentences Flipkart displays for openbox before making the payment. It will be solved I have lost over 2 lakh rs in crypto being in a lower middle class family. Life time savings but I didn't think of suicide So don't say stupid things like this Yeah about that. Looks like you value you 75k over your life. You've got more issues than losing 75k if you ask me. Which literally amounts to little to nothing in the long run. Try to get it back otherwise make peace with getting scammed and move on. If it's too good to be true, it most probably is. Think of it as a 75k lesson and move on. There are many complaints about this seller. I hope these links help. [https://www.google.com/search?q=TREASURE+HAUL+ONLINE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=TREASURE+HAUL+ONLINE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) bhai exactly my thoughts, trivializing something like suicide for a macbook, for college Keep yourself together, brother. Your case seems strong enough, plus you have video evidence too. Something will turn in your favour. Ignore macbook, for any purchase a basic research should have done. Dell, HP, Lenovo for instance fleece people on windows laptops similarly. Now he has proof so he will likely get refunded but as the saying goes \"a fool and his gold is soon parted.\" His parents paid for it so File a complaint, thats your only remedy Same statement but hard work of their parents. which city is this..? All the people asking to go to consumer court ,order another macbook pro this time a better spec version .now keep the macbook and tell the delivery giy to fuck off and close the door.he will say i will lose my job and bullshit .just say not my problem.after a week or so flipkart will call you and ask you why you doing this sir tell him this and he will say we will file a police complaint tell him to go ahead .they wont for 1 lakh rs because it is bad publicity for them. I have done this so i know as i was victim to something like this.you can dm if you need any help. wait what how why when Middle class guy why do you need Mac Book Pro worth 75k? One thing to keep in mind is that. Always use a credit card while purchasing stuff online. Just had a similar incident. I got fridge delivered which is a little defective. I told them to do a replacement. The replacement was even sent out and reached my city. The they canceled it and now they are claiming to reach out to seller. Apparently the issue i raised was \"damaged\" and not \"defective\". But since it was open box delivery, Imno visible damage was found. Now I've been calling Flipkart and seller and hoping that this is resolved. Never expected such services from Flipkart. Don‚Äôt know which city you‚Äôre from but a few things you can do : a. Consumer court b. Local police station c. Maybe try contacting some YouTuber who covers such scam related content. They could make your incident viral if you‚Äôve photo/ video proof to back it up. This might help in making the case reach out to more people. d. Pls contact a local newspaper or even bigger ones like times and all. Find out who writes the crime reports, their mail id is given. Mail them the details. Contact the editorial for this. They love these cases. Hope you get back the money Sure. Application is also available for both iOS and Android. There was a recent post on r/India of a girl who was scammed via Amazon. Yes, that's a lot of money but there is no need to feel suicidal for it. With luck and discipline, you can earn more money in future. This can happen to anyone. Learn the lesson and move on. MacBook Air, not MacBook Pro, but yes I understand your point. The fact that you could afford to pay for a Rs 76000 laptop upfront suggests that you do have the means and this is not such a huge amount for you. Regardless it is not worth ending your life. Take the L for now and try your best to recover. Other people have already given some good suggestions including consumer court. Honestly DON'T BUY ANYTHING ON FLIPKART. Ordered 3k worth of art supplies (washi tape etc) and they're not what they showed in images, asked for return, refused. The another box which was sent was alreaady opened and there were less tapes. I fucking hate the open box crap that Flipkart pulls, ruined a phone unboxing experience with the delivery person only touching my phone with filthy hands during COVID. Do the unbox and record it but I will be the one doing both along with the delivery person filming too if needed. Dont worry consumer court will get your money back and good chunk of extra money for all the harassment and pain. why not?? can middle class people not save up and buy a macbook? :( OP I have lost 30 lacs to IDBI Bank. I'm just as middle class as you. But never ever think money is worth more than your life!!! As long as you have your health you can make money! As for this case, you need not even worry because you have proofs and Flipkart can't just scam you like that. Please reach out to Consumer court. That's why I always use Amazon. I have lots of scams related to Flipkart and rarely any related to Amazon. Infact Amazon customer is much better than Flipkart. They will try their best to solve your problems ASAP while Flipkart? It's the worst! Lifebuoy ka sabun hai ye log. 99.99 percent. Bro don‚Äôt stress it I know it‚Äôs a lot of money in India but you‚Äôll get more and more senior in your career where that money will be nothing Seconded, I also attempted to buy an expensive laptop from FK and they played several games with me; delayed delivery, no response from agent, order delivered but not received, then they increased the price and asked me to pay the remaining and \"uske baad delivery hogi\". Spent a month on the case and finally just did a chargeback cuz was lucky to have used a CC. Bro, do update us when your issue gets resolved Why credit card ? Thank you üòä I did got called for refund, but I'll update when they'll send money in my account that'll be on 28th august Don't explain your purchases to random strangers. It is your choice what you buy. I too avoid Flipkart. But bought pixel 6a. The delivery guy however gave the box to me and told me to unbox and check. It was weird to unbox standing in my doorway, but atleast I did the unboxing. Still, it's pretty dumb policy honestly. Welp - Better luck next time! This guy is playing, dont trust him. If losing a MacBook makes you suicidal you have a different problem to worry about other than the money lost. Credit card istemal kar re ho aur 81k ka laptop hai aur apne AAP ko garib bata re ho you are moron period also buy things from Credit card and do a charge back Don't know op personally but from what I can see he is a moron probably in his late teens Can you share your incident how you lost this much amount Tf bro, how? Was it fuckcart too? Op is in his late teens bacha hai abhi üòÖüòÖ Congratulations brother‚ù§Ô∏è I have completely stopped using flipkart since the day the news of people receiving bricks and soap bar. I have worked as a social media specialist and I can‚Äôt even tell you how many tweets there are where a customer has received a defective product, never really received the product, never refunded money. From smartphones to tv and laptops. I wonder how this platform still not in trouble for literally looting the customers and then the mental harassment that comes later speaking to the customer care representatives who mostly lack manners and etiquettes. ONE THING I found out recently about Flipkart reviews for TV smelling suspicious just to know later that whenever you purchase a TV the manufacturer will get in touch with you over WhatsApp and offer you an extended warranty of 3 months in exchange for 5 star reviews so basically regardless of the product‚Äôs quality, service assistance, build quality, shelf life one would end up buying faulty product. If you have made it till here, thanks. During the sales like big billion days, do check out Twitter hashtags you will have your blood boiling to see how big of a fraudulent this company is even when it‚Äôs not you who is in loss but you empathise with someone who‚Äôs suffering insurance money. they rejected my claim. Just put it on twitter OP, learn cross posting. It will be helpful for staying on reddit. Didn‚Äôt read but who gets suicidal over 75K rupees. Like lol üòÇ bro really. You really ready to give up your life over this much Good work fam. That's why I love Reddit! Which college work requires a 70K Macbook? Sad to say hum aise law and order ko empower karne ke liye tax bharte hai Why would they save up to buy MacBook? Hello Brother. So glad you got your money back. I know you will be extra careful from now on. Cheers! what's OTP ? Lesson Number 1: Don't ever order from the bitch called flipkart. They give attractive offers just to attract honeybees like you. The best you can do is go to consumer court and if they couldn't help then just forget about the money. It's a common scam run by flipkart and you should have been aware of it. Open delivery is terrible. They‚Äôre absolving themselves of all responsibility. Someone isn‚Äôt always going to be physically present. First 76k is not worth being sucidal, calm down. Second, You're not dumb, he is literally scamming you if he said it was flipkart protocol and it wasn't, i wont be surprised if this is a new type of scam where depivery boy is a part of it, people really do need to be very careful and read terms and conditions on these websites before purchasing or stick to local purchase for simplicity and less hassle and avoiding getting scammed. Retweeted hoping it helped. its a expensive purchase, accidents can happen. What will you do if something goes wrong. you spill a cup of tea on it or it falls down from the corner of the bed. Why? Can you elaborate on this. Because they want it? What kind of question is that even... This is a reason why you should never pay by UPI for anything you would not regret seeing lost totally. It is convenient but lacks features like chargebacks. You're missing the point. Anyway, looks like he got the money back. Contact Peepoye on Twitter, he's an influencer and I guess he supports people on Twitter, try reaching him out. Be very careful when buying online. NEVER trust random online sellers. It sucks for all of the genuine small indie sellers, but that's life. I'm glad you got your money back. Best thing to do, contact a lawyer and get them to send a legal notice in such cases. It's not an actual case yet, but it may get companies to take it more seriously. Shit happens, it's life. The one thing that I have a problem is you saying that you're suicidal because of this. You've got something really wrong going on OP. This shouldn't be your first thought, sounds like you're getting your money back, which is good, but please do work on your mental health,. for your own sake. Bro go to consumer court asap Credit Cards has something called chargebacks. Credit Cards have something called chargebacks. if you don't receive the goods or services you paid for. If you're scammed by a fraudulent seller, you can contact your credit card issuer and dispute the charge, potentially getting your money back.have Mate just a thought, if you are getting broken and suicidal because of Rs. 76,000,I will advise to sell this laptop and seek mental health coach. Cause this life is going to be a lot tougher than that. This mishap/mistake will seem like a luxury. So did they not take the cycle back. And was it very costly? If 76k makes your suicidal then you need to rethink your finances, spending & future. It‚Äôs a drop of water in the bucket for most. Tag police and also place an FIR. And then talk to Flipkart, they'll usually take actions once they see the FIR report and all. I think if you purchase a Mac with student id You will get it cheaper around same price so no need to order from some where else. Scammers are present in both at Amazon and Flipkart. But Amazon's customer service is what makes them better. It cost me 32.5k. Yes, they took back the cycle. Charged me 1000 rupees for packaging because I threw out the box. But I have peace of mind atleast. Yeah but first preference should always be offline especially apple products I‚Äôm surprised people still use Flipkart . Stopped using it 3 years ago. Absolute dogshit. Agreed. Oh, thnx good to know. Why people still use Flipkart don't get it , switch to Amazon or your local dealer. Amazon use Trusted sellers Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo aren't meant for college when MacBook money is lost, OP has reach to a point considering Suicide...WHY? The OP said he got into a good college that's why his parents gifted him Mac. Why you care? Let he be happy Just search \"TREASURE HAUL ONLINE\" name online. There are multiple complain Just search \"TREASURE HAUL ONLINE\" name online. There are multiple complaints. Seems like they are fraud sellers. And still, Flipkart is allowing them to do business on their platform. Shame... *(Got another reason why I should not order from Flipkart)* While the current open box delivery being the sole option, and absolving any responsibility post OTP is definitely scummy from flipkart, flipkart isn't necessarily bad. Most of my purchases I do through Amazon, but my biggest ones like my LG C2, ROG Ally, two smartphones, galaxy watch I did through Flipkart with 0 issues. People just have to be vigilant and aware how both of the platforms work. Both platforms have sketchy sellers, just the scam processes are different and people at best apply their sleuthing skills learned from Amazon and fail to detect scams on flipkart. In the case of the LG C2 my plan was to purchase through Amazon but on the day of making the order the fulfilled sellers had their stock run out and had nonfullfilled sellers. At that point buying through FK Assured seller over a non-fulfilled Amazon seller was simply more trustworthy. I'd easily rate Amazon Fulfilled>>FK Assured>>Amazon random seller>>Flipkart sketchy seller. Agreed on the Apple store, unless something is exclusive most of the big companies like Apple, Samsung have the same prices everywhere with or without offers. I am not here to give you a lesson or to clarify your response, sure he is happy now (getting a refund) but he shouldn't have witnessed suicidal thoughts at this young age. And the bigger scams are when they have some sort of failure with their pricing. I once ordered a memory foam pillow for 99 RS due to a pricing error. The smartass seller or fk, ended up sending a pillow from the street(had black marks and possibly mold). Immediately returned and wrote a review on the product, FK removed the review saying it's a seller review and not applicable to the product. Flipkart is a horrible place to buy electronics. I made the mistake of buying two phones. Never again. It's not your fault okay? I understand we feel dumb when we get scammed.but the scammers should be more ashamed of this Ever wondered why they are selling cheaper than the manufacturer themselves? I have faced multiple issues with Flipkart in the past. I once ordered a Dell replacement battery from them. Turned out the seller was selling batteries that were discontinued. Another time I ordered a technical book that was quite expensive and which I needed for my work. The seller sent me a copy of Pride and Prejudice - a good book but not what I ordered. I escalated the issue and it received a refund. One issue with Flipkart is negative reviews are simply removed!. I no longer buy anything from Flipkart and usually use Amazon. I really like the Croma Store because its prices are comparable to online retailers ,always use a credit card for purchases my dad has got a amex card it looks lovely üòçüòç This was covered in news too India Today: Man orders MacBook worth Rs 76,000 from Flipkart, receives boAt speakers worth Rs 3000. Congrats .. today it‚Äôs even in news .. Thank the reporter .. [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/man-orders-macbook-worth-rs-76000-from-flipkart-receives-boat-speakers-worth-rs-3000-2425455-2023-08-23) It definitely a scam,I tried to withdraw money and there are telling me to pay 20% according to IRS,I almost fell for that too after paying $35k before I came across someone testify about the same platform,so I ask her how she get her money back from them,she then introduced me to(@reclaim_assest) Instagram What about OP who gives OTP without verifying the product? Who rejected your claim? the bank or insurance company? I am thinking of getting health insurance but I am not sure what its worth. The company I guess. It has a different name now.. It was my father's life insurance. I couldn't claim it after his death. I don't know much about these things. The agents who came for investigation asked me for his medical history which I gave. I'm autistic and live alone I don't know how to deal with things like this so they most likely scammed me. I think you are right. I wish your father taught you how to deal with such circumstances. Looks like the company and an insurance company clubbed together for this scam. What's the insurance company name? It saves the rest of us by avoiding it. he should have :( IDBI life insurance. Is this the same story...OP did u reach out to any media outlets... just curious Which AMD Ryzen processor? Please link me to an AMD Ryzen processor that benchmarks better than an M1, and is available in a 73k price range, I‚Äôll wait. Not to mention a laptop that gives you 18 hours of battery life. Not many people care about Linux or User repairability. People however do care about having some of the best speakers on a laptop, a top notch trackpad, instant wake from sleep, etc. Some of you people are clueless about what the general public actually care about. Show me another laptop within a 73k budget that offers a 2K display panel, a processor that benchmarks as well as an M1, offers 18 hours of battery life, has speakers and a trackpad as acclaimed as the ones on that ‚Äú3 year old MacBook Air‚Äù, or instant wake from sleep that doesn‚Äôt drain your battery. Please link me to a windows laptop that has every one of these things that doesn‚Äôt cost more than the 3 year old MacBook Air. I just looked up the E series thinkpad. A 1080p TN panel and 8 hours battery life for 70k is ‚Äúfar, FAR better‚Äù. Y‚Äôall love getting scammed. That is a garbage tier display for a decidedly premium price. Firstly, you are an Apple/TaylorSwift fanboy. Secondly... I consider machines that cannot run x86 software as not computers. ARM Macbooks are glorified iPhones (even have a notch now). I consider 10-12 hours of battery more than enough for a day. I consider unrepairable Macbooks as Fisher Price toys. Anyone outside of a use case of Final Cut Pro or audio production is not a traditional computer user and exclusively uses their Macbooks just as much as they would find use out of $200 Chromebooks ‚Äì word documents, web browsing and 1080p video streaming. Touchpad and speakers are Macbook's strengths. But what about the weaknesses like: * a bad keyboard * bad durability * lack of repairability * user not being able to swap RAM and HDD/SSD * not being able to use Windows/Linux freely * lack of ports * lack of free software * incompatibility with non-Apple users (Windows, Linux, Android) * x86 incompatibility (95% of computer software is not made for ARM) * WHAT IS THE NOTCH DOING ON THE SCREEN? ... and so on? Macbook is only good for people with the most basic surfing machine needs, something even a Chromebook can do. Its just a glorified Chromebook unless you are a Final Cut Pro or professional audio producer user. Objectively, this does make Macbook an inferior prospect for any user who want to do anything more serious than surfing the web. ThinkPad also has IPS options and your dookey Macbook glass screen with no anti glare film will be a piece of shit both outdoors and indoors. Indoors because there are tubelights behind you, unless you sit in bed to stream Netflix, and outdoors because there is sun and all kinds of bright objects behind you. I can use those 10 hours of battery life to actually do work and actually be able to create documents and files compatible with Windows, Linux and Android peers. Your hunk of expensive Fisher Price crApple cannot survive a fall and cannot run 95% of the software made for computers. Also you are an Apple/TaylorSwift fanboy."
