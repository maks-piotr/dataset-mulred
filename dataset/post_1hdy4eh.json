        "How many of those that opted for placements secured jobs? \n\nIt has never been 100% graduates securing jobs for any colleges. Even, my college that is regarded for IIT level placements doesn't get 100% as people choose MS, or creating startup or banking on PPO rather than getting a job at a company they don't like.",
        "It takes a clown mindset to think that India, a country with a per capita GDP of $2500, can afford a UBI.\n\nSure, you can get your UBI, but it will be the same as the one for the brick kiln labourer, that is, a princely sum of ₹500 per month.",
        "Start taxing the rich and super-rich and you'll be able to give Rs. 5000 per month to each unemployed Indian",
        "53% of those who registered for placement got jobs. That means 47% of those who registered did not get a job. Those who go for MS or start-up usually don't register for placements and thus don't get counted in the placement stats.",
        "Where does it say the data only consists of people who sat for placements? Also, many students register for placements, but are already sending out applications to universities for Masters/PhD.",
        "I am myself from an IIT so I know about these things. Also, those sending applications are the ones who are not confident of getting placement. Masters is their backup plan.",
        "You’d bankrupt the government, cause massive brain drain and capital flight along with a rapid deindustrialisation before achieving your goal. And even after all that the people will still be dirt poor. \n\n\nUBI makes sense for developed countries where coupled with automation it could provide another avenue for people to support themselves while working on their own ventures (remember this UBI has to be a substantial amount to makes sure the recipients are well taken care of. Currently no country can afford this while also maintaining existing welfare measures).",
        "Which ones though? In my college, Chemical, Civil and Mechanical had very less core companies. 80-90% opted for software and those that hadn't studied for software then proceeded to do Masters. Even Electrical ones. That has always been true. People from my college dropped rather than being forced to interview for Infosys or poor paying companies, in favor of CAT, GATE, GRE, UPSC etc.\n\nThe question is how much is it different from 2018, 2019, 2022 or 2023. Because, one can always present the data in ways which can make it look bad or good. I would guess students in the college should be getting a sheet from placement units with full details.",
        "AI is going to increase profits which will increase tax revenue and that's how UBI will become feasible",
        "Companies are already reporting record profits while increase in income of salaried employees has been negligible for years now. Would be much more feasible and better to force companies to regularly hike wages than implement a massive ubi campaign that would most likely deindustrialise the nation.",
        "All this to bootlick the rich. Pathetic.",
        "I am not one to bootlick the rich as you say. I’m just pointing out what fiscal irresponsibility and tax terrorism will do to any developing country. Our consumption and industrial output are already stalling at best or regressing at worst. \n\n\nIf anything the government should reduce taxes, simplify and unify the labour codes and incentivise investment from foreign and domestic corporations and HNIs to induce job growth and a rise in demand of goods and services. This coupled with generous benefits of companies investing into R&D and employment would be the best case scenario for us atm.",
        "When IITians ain't getting jobs what about others? 😭",
        "I am going to say it - reservations.",

        "This is a fake statistic which equates net worth to GDP.  Net worth is a stock, and GDP is a flow – they can't be compared.",

        "Then please stop doing these intentional convo derailments.",
        "It's not dw..",
        "Yes, 5th avenue and Park Avenue. What’s the point here?",
        "Ache din aa gaye",
        "UBI is a stupid concept ..\n\nUnemployment benefits should be introduced to salaried employees who pay income tax...\n\nBenefits should be based on the taxes they paid in the preceding years... That's how it is in western Europe.",
        "It says the remaining chose other avenues - this includes study abroad, entrepreneurship, etc.",
        "Dude,,, remaining probably are going to study abroad or entrepreneurship or off campus.,.",
        "You’re the first guy in an Indian subreddit that has spelled “labourer” right instead of writing “labour”",
        "Not true tbh. That's pretty anecdotal. I know people (including me) who did the opposite. Registered for placements and applied for higher studies with placements as the backup.\nYou don't hear back about applications till March. ",
        "Yeah somehow taking the same tax rate India had for years before it was lowered will be what causes the bankrupting of the government?\nI don't get this amount of booklicking whenever any taxing of rich comes up. Sure people can move but the move itself can be costly and not worth it. The loopholes to prevent rich people/corporations to not pay taxes exist cause they pay politicians to create those loopholes. ",
        "Look at my other comment on this thread. Taxation of this extent and complication is a death sentence for any developing economy. Especially since the tax burden will mostly fall on the salaried middle and upper class. The ones who own the means of production will simply take their money and their corporations to whichever country offers them better accommodations.",
        "Well, you still haven't told me why India's higher corporate tax rate before the most recent tax cut was somehow destroying the Indian economy. Or will the tax cut add a few %age points to growth from now on? Cause I don't think there is one such agreed-upon number among economists. The reason is that moving means of production and money is not as simple as you think it is. There's moving fixed assets, plus maybe tariffs etc will make it impossible to target indian market without manufacturing in it etc. Also, how is a corporate tax rate somehow the tax burden that falls on the salaried middle and upper class? \n\nMoreover, it's not taxation that attracts companies, things like red tape, ease of doing business, and a strong legal system they can use to handle disputes matter a great deal. Plus the cost of labour of course. \n\nCause otherwise lets just make minimum wage 0, cause economic development is all that matters right? Just sell everything to corporations and have no labour laws whatsoever. Somehow economy is about getting a higher GDP number not to improve the overall standard of living of the workforce.",
        "> You’d bankrupt the government, cause massive brain drain and capital flight along with a rapid deindustrialisation before achieving your goal. And even after all that the people will still be dirt poor.\n\nPlain old fearmongering.\n\nAlso, fact: govt is already bankrupt, which is why they have been increasing taxes albeit on the middle and lower class. Imagine how much they will get when they finally start taxing the rich.",
        "The government isn't bankrupt. Far from it, we have 100s of billions in reserves still running. They need taxes to fund their infrastructure products, freebies, and corporate tax reduction",
        "Yet you got fooled by this",
        "Then use the funds from reserves, the same way they started transferring RBI reserve funds and interest in the govt accounts.",
        "No if we use up the reserves like that then we will definitely end up in a Bangladesh situation lol. We are already using reserves are for shoeing up the rupee against the dollar. In the last 2 years, the dollar has appreciated 3% against the rupee despite our $200 billion merchandise trade deficit due to using the funds from reserves. This is normally unsustainable and this is how Bangladesh ended up in their situation for inflating their currency. However we are able to do this sustainably due to 1) service exports and 2) Remittances which bring enough dollars to balance the deficit"
