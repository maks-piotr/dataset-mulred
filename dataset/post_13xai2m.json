There are enough problems and issues on which the opposition parties can combine to make a serious dent in 2024 elections, if not go for an outright win \n\nI still think that Rahul Gandhi has that stigma that needs to be washed off with consistency in his election results. One win in Karnataka is not enough to warrant making him the face again for the PM and he shouldn't aspire for it either. However, the general public definitely has been feeling a pinch, and if the messaging can be done correctly, a savvy political manager can drive the opposition to a very strong foothold in the 2024 elections. \n\nOptimistic, but not hopeful about the future.",
