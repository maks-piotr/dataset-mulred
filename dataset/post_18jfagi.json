People drive on the wrong side of the road in not only their cycle rickshaws, bikes but even cars and pickups, just to save that â‚¹10 worth of fuel or 5 minutes. That's how much they think their own life is worth. \n\nIt's an open question on why people don't value life. Maybe it is because there are 1.4 bn of us (cheap labor to replace the dead, boss breathing down your neck to work quick or be fired), or maybe just low self esteem due to myriad of factors.",
        "Is this a serious question? ðŸ˜‚. This is what you find important? \n\nAnd what does this have to do with 'Indians'? One govt rule and all manufactured trailers will be built with all kinds of bars you like whether 'indians' want it or not.",

It's too improve the drag coefficient of the truck and keep it more streamlined to improve fuel efficiency. Often seen only in Long Haul trucks in the US!!",
