        "dude you're not even looking intellectual or cool. But i won't stoop down to your religion and say anything about Islam. But you know despite not liking BJP, i know the extremist sentiment in this country in hindus is because of how extremist your religion is without even trying.",

First provide your point of bringing in religion into this, and then question me why I labelled you as 'muslim'. \nDid any hindu ever forced you on extreme point to follow their rituals? or \"fairy god\"? let people believe what they believe in. \nOr, do you only believe in a flying horse? I know for a fact that i wont ever see you commenting about anything for the second most majority people in this country. \nAur ye 'hindu khatre hai' ka jibe kisi aur ko dena. \nYou criticize political party as much as you want, but you wont have the guts to speak a thing about Islam as you do with Hinduism.\nThe truth for peeps like you are, andhbhakt dono taraf hai, just the god is different.",

        "No reason? \n\nThis judge's two infamous judgements were both based on religious justifications. \n\nNow he joins BJP, a party that promotes and propagates religious fundamentalism by Sanatan Dharma followers. \n\nThis same party's leaders took out a protest in Kathua in support of child rapists simply because they were Sanatan Dharma followers.\n\nThis same party's leaders justified pardon of Bilkis Bano rapists because they're Brahmins and supposedly of \"good samskar.\"\n\nEVERYTHING BJP does is justified in the name of Sanatan Dharma philosophy and cultural values.  This judge said in any interview, \"My thinking aligns with the philosophy of the BJP.\" So he's literally a Sanatani by his own admission.\n\nYet here you are lecturing us why pointing that out is \"bringing in religion for no reason.\" Too late for that. If you're such a big fan of the religion, go ask BJP why *it* brings in religion for no reason.\n\nAlso, how is \"rape-supporting Sanatani\" wrong? He himself told a rapist to tie a rakhi and make a rape victim his sister. Hence \"rape-supporting Sanatani.\" It isn't saying anything about the religion per se. There are \"rape-criticizing Sanatanis\" and there are \"rape-supporting Sanatanis.\"",
        "Does BJP use religion in their politics? YES\nDo they justify religion extremism? YES\nSo, you are saying that since a party, uses religion as their tool for political gains that justifies you spewing hatred for that religion?\nDid congress not appease muslims? I can count you numerous instances where they did things which were just to appease them, do they not do things not to appease caste votes? So, who do you blame or criticize? they political parties? or the community? \nDoesn't owaisi uses muslim votebank? So, should i criticize him or the religion? \nExtending the same logic, the terrorist groups use Islam as a tool to radicalise people? who should i blame? the terrorists or the entire religion? \nDude, you contradict the very principle you stand on.",

        "When did I say that?",
        "I don't get your logic or way of thinking at all so probably hold back on your \"gotcha\"s and \"so your point is\" for now.\n\nIf a Muslim says behead the blasphemer, then it's perfectly fine to term people like him as radical Muslims. They are radical and their radicalization is related to Islamic teachings. But there are also non-radical Muslims, forgiving Muslims, ignoring Muslims, atheist Muslims, progressive Muslims, etc. on the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\nIf a communist says kill the oppressors, it's perfectly fine to term them communist extremists. They are extremists and their radicalization is based in an interpretation of communist ideology. But there are also non-violent communists, Marxist communists, democratic communists, etc on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nIf a hospital's practices routinely suck patients dry of all their savings, it's perfectly fine to term them greedy hospitals. They are greedy and their greed emerges in their healthcare practices. But there are also non-greedy hospitals, altruistic hospitals, etc. on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nNone of these is \"blaming the entire community\" of Muslims, communists, or hospitals. They're all subsets qualified by appropriate adjectives and with identity relevant to a particular context.\n\nSo I'm wondering how you can interpret \"rape-supporting Sanatanis\" as \"blaming the entire community.\" There's some kind of wrong interpretation of the concept of collective in your mind that you probably need to correct.",
