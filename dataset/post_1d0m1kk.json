    "selftext": "So this happened a week back. \nMy friend had downloaded this dating app called 'Boo'. I had never heard of it so I had no clue how genuine this was. \nHe got a match with a girl named 'Sonal Verma'. She instantly messaged him and after chatting for a while they both exchanged their numbers. She asked him to meet at R.K. Ashram Marg metro station. \nThe other day my friend went their and after talking for a while, she said she's hungry and asked to go a restaurant nearby. The restaurant's name was 'Bunon Bar n Lounge'. My friend, without doing any research of his own, went there. \nAs soon as he entered, they weren't given any menu card, and the girl ordered 5 gun-fire shot, a hookah, along with a plate of some starter snack. \nAfter a while the girl asked my friend to come to accompany her to the washroom to which he denied as he suspected something fishy with that pub. \nHe asked for the bill, and the waiter came up with a paper slip on which the amount of bill was written 'INR 22,000'. \nMy friend insisted the staff to give their menu card so as to check the amount to which they denied. He tried to go out but the staff didn't allow him. The girl said that she didn't have any money with her, but after insisting for a while she agreed to split the bill in half. \nStill my friend ended up paying 11k to that restaurant for something that he didn't even use. \nAs soon as I got to know about this, I looked up this resturant over Google and Instagram and found similar cases. I saw that people had shared their experiences of them getting scammed at the same place with the same girl, and having the same phone number as well. Few reviews even said that the victim had to pay 68k in some cases.\n\nIt is pretty obvious that this is a scam that is being run in sort of a partnership of both the restaurant and the girls. \n\nBut I am sharing this just so everyone is aware of this, and so that you make sure and do your own research before going on dates over such shady apps. \n\nP. S. I, along with my other friends, had suggested the guy to report the same to the nearest police station, but sadly my friend wasn't too keen on interacting with police on the same. \n\nAlso regarding the girl, she blocked him as soon as they left the place.
