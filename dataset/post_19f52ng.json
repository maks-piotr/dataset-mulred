        "I'm pro choice but that's an 8 month old baby. Such a tough decision and disgusting act but I think this is the right call. If the baby was born today it would most likely survive with no intervention so an abortion would be pure cruelty.",
        "Rape itself is disgusting! What kind of a sick monster one has to be to do it to his own child..rip his nails,eyes,teeth, tongue out one by one.",
        "Is there no saturation point for these kind of stories? It always amazes me",
        "If the doctors think termination was safer. then that should have been allowed.",
        "Which child? The poor little girl or the newborn baby?",
        "It‚Äôs really a shitty situation from both sides.\n\nThird trimester abortions are generally associated with a lot of complications for the mother and there‚Äôs also the moral/ethical aspect of it.\n\nBut on the other side. This is a 11 year old CHILD. Child birth at such a small age will certainly be very difficult. And the changes the body undergoes after delivery are basically occurring in her even before teenage. \nAnd then there‚Äôs the mental and emotional aspect.\n\nEither option leads to the suffering of on innocent child.\nI just hope she has people around who will support and protect her. I can‚Äôt even imagine someone having to go through this.",
        "I agree. But nevertheless what a monster that man is. I hope he has to pay for his sins, one way or the other.",
        "How can they force a 11 year old to give birth? They ignore the real victim here",
        "It's not that simple we have to also think about the baby's right to live \n\nWe can't just murderer the baby at this stage when it's been 8 months.",
        "Forcing a 11 year old to give birth even for a 8 month old is certainly a decision \n\nPoor girl never had any choice",

        "Can we please castrate ( or simply cut private parts ) man who rape women in India from now on. Please. It's not a lot to ask and our country's population is the highest in the world anyway. \n\nI would really like the govt to put the same energy they put in Ram Mandir. \n\nAlso, i understand why this rulling was made. As much as I'm pro choice, the baby inside her is 8 months old and at this point it'll be commuting a murder if they do abortion. And it'll do nothing much for the girl anyway because she has already suffered the trauma of being raped and carrying the baby for 8 months.",
        "what the fuck?! \n\nThis is the main issue with the country. I am fucking tired of everything revolving around religion. Why the fuck can't we do better for women safety?",

        "The baby doesn't have conscience yet to be innocent. It's a fetus. Couple of cells. They're ruining a fully developed and functional human's life for an unborn bunch of cells. She could die while giving birth. And why should she birth the child of such a monster? If she wishes to have the kid she can. But if she doesn't, no one has the right to stop her fr getting it aborted.",
        "That's appalling. Also, if it's safe for her to get aborted then she should have the right to get aborted.",

        "I think the doctors have a bit of a more expert opinion about this than you do",

It clearly outlines the predicament that men face when women misuse those laws. I could make a counterpoint to your argument that women mostly marry men to use them, dump them, and run off with their money -- or threaten them with imprisonment over false accusations. The generalization doesn't feel nice now does it?\n\nIf you watch the documentry, it would clearly show that false cases are overtaking a real ones by alot. \n\nShould I stop feeling sorry for the *real* women who go through such predicaments because women mostly just use men for their benfit? \n\nWhat we *need* to work on is developing our education system, spreading awareness of mutual consent, proper rehabilitation system. Making people aware of the gravity of such offences and its consequences on the victims -- men and women both. \n\nAny form of punishment -- physical, and capital -- isn't acting as a proper deterrent now, is it?

Your suggestion is entirely out of anger without considering anything else. \n\nImagine if rape laws in India were equal for women and women couple be punished for rape. Now imagine a women gets convicted of rape and we apply your methods to her. The equivalent would be to permanently stitch her vaginal opening to the point it will only ever be able to pass menstrual blood from a tiny opening. Sounds gruesome but justified to you? Now imagine a few years later it turns out she was wrongly prosecuted. You will never be able to undo what you did to her. That person has to live her only life with a useless stitched up vagina. You cannot take a chance with your judgement when the punishment is so gruesome.\n\nThe only reason I am flipping genders here is because believe it or not, it is easier to understand this from your own genders perspective. You can directly relate to it. \n\nPunishments like castration or any kind of mutilations are absolutely stupid, it breeds a society where these things start to feel normal to people. These kinds of punishments are unnatural and should always be treated as extreme and not the norm no matter how 'justified' they may seem in individual cases.Imagine the mutilation the mob would start doing because well the government does it in some cases so why not do the same to our enemies? The future generations will start using these kinds of mutilations to retaliate against each other for crimes of much lesser degree. In 50 years from now you will have people castrating/mutilating each other for theft. There is no going back once you open that gate. Now you are living in the dark ages. The fabric of society is more delicate than you think.",

El Salvador's homicide rate thus decreased by nearly 70% percent in 2023. Of course, the way in which this was done was controversial internationally but the citizens of El Salvador themselves support the President because he was able to bring safety to the previously violence-torn country by doing this.

    "light_cleaned_title": "Rajasthan man rapes minor daughter for a year, court denies abortion plea",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Meanwhile, the Rajasthan High Court has turned down the rape victim‚Äôs petition to terminate her 32-week pregnancy, ruling that abortion at such an advanced stage could \"endanger\" her life. The court noted that a fully developed foetus also has a right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "32 weeks cannot be terminated. Right decision I'm pro choice but that's an 8 month old baby. Such a tough decision and disgusting act but I think this is the right call. If the baby was born today it would most likely survive with no intervention so an abortion would be pure cruelty. Rape itself is disgusting! What kind of a sick monster one has to be to do it to his own child..rip his nails,eyes,teeth, tongue out one by one. Is there no saturation point for these kind of stories? It always amazes me If the doctors think termination was safer. then that should have been allowed. Which child? The poor little girl or the newborn baby? It‚Äôs really a shitty situation from both sides. Third trimester abortions are generally associated with a lot of complications for the mother and there‚Äôs also the moral/ethical aspect of it. But on the other side. This is a 11 year old CHILD. Child birth at such a small age will certainly be very difficult. And the changes the body undergoes after delivery are basically occurring in her even before teenage. And then there‚Äôs the mental and emotional aspect. Either option leads to the suffering of on innocent child. I just hope she has people around who will support and protect her. I can‚Äôt even imagine someone having to go through this. I agree. But nevertheless what a monster that man is. I hope he has to pay for his sins, one way or the other. How can they force a 11 year old to give birth? They ignore the real victim here It's not that simple we have to also think about the baby's right to live We can't just murderer the baby at this stage when it's been 8 months. Forcing a 11 year old to give birth even for a 8 month old is certainly a decision Poor girl never had any choice just sitting here thinking about what if the man was from THAT one specific religion. Can we please castrate ( or simply cut private parts ) man who rape women in India from now on. Please. It's not a lot to ask and our country's population is the highest in the world anyway. I would really like the govt to put the same energy they put in Ram Mandir. Also, i understand why this rulling was made. As much as I'm pro choice, the baby inside her is 8 months old and at this point it'll be commuting a murder if they do abortion. And it'll do nothing much for the girl anyway because she has already suffered the trauma of being raped and carrying the baby for 8 months. what the fuck?! This is the main issue with the country. I am fucking tired of everything revolving around religion. Why the fuck can't we do better for women safety? But aborting at this stage will probably kill the victim too :( And giving birth won't? Can‚Äôt even imagine the actüíî. That guy should be hanged and the girl should get all types of help she needs. Doctors should be consulted about keeping the baby or not and she definitely doesn‚Äôt deserve any of this at such a young age. The baby doesn't have conscience yet to be innocent. It's a fetus. Couple of cells. They're ruining a fully developed and functional human's life for an unborn bunch of cells. She could die while giving birth. And why should she birth the child of such a monster? If she wishes to have the kid she can. But if she doesn't, no one has the right to stop her fr getting it aborted. That's appalling. Also, if it's safe for her to get aborted then she should have the right to get aborted. Baby ke karan use maoom bacchi ke bare mein bhi sochana chahie. At 32 weeks it's normally a full grown baby, which can survive outside the womb. Newborn You would be no different than the rapist if you did that. Just lock him up and give him a just punishment. Medieval torture isn't the solution. I agree but she's 11. Her body isn't even developed enough to go through labor. There's many after affects of pregnancy and labor, some being permanent. At this age, delivery a baby is risky, she could face permanent issues due to this. Why risk it? I think the doctors have a bit of a more expert opinion about this than you do It wasn't doctors who denied it, it was the courts which denied it. You do need a doctor to even file a petition like this. Bhai civil code hai, sharia nahi. There are better and more civilised ways available to deal with such miscreants. Peak Rajasthan moment. Bc, Pehle har cheez to country ka color dena band karo, absolute chutias like you are ruining all important national discourses into the gutter. India has quite liberal abortion laws when compared with many first world countries. So unless you are a doctor or a lawyer, pl refrain from making a judgement. But yes, I am sure we can do a whole lot better for ensuring such incidents don't happen again and that the victim gets good support system later. This is totally a logical way to deal with these kind of people And the kinder approach. I'm not asking them to be stoned to death which is what they deserve. What does this have to do with religion it literally says right there its safer for her to deliver not abort do yk how dangerous aborting an 8month old would be? Take a lil time to think before comment mindlessly. Read before you get all worked up please Any reason why this motherfucker is not named and shamed, or would revealing name bring shame to their brethren üíÄ Yeah but if we do this we have to be 100% sure with no reasonable doubt about the offense. A lot of false cases also get attached so have to think how that will be addressed. According to atheists this is normal and they would throw some Freudian bs at you justifying it . I don't want to be different then. No mercy to rapists. 1)Use a knife 2) Cut them somewhere with it so they bleed 3) Then stitch it without anaesthesia. 4) Repeat Steps from 1 to 3 untill he starts begging for death. After he starts begging tie his legs and hands on a pole and let the dogs eat him alive. I did not mean that this is about religion. I meant the only thing people think of and the thing that the media, government and people revolve around is religion and not extreme issues like this. >In its order, the bench of Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand said the delay by the child in approaching the court \"has only further aggravated the said aspect\" of termination of pregnancy, and relied on the Medical Board's statement and existing judgments to turn down the request \"And relied on the medical board's statement and existing judgements\" read before getting mad ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è omg New evidence comes out proving his Innocence. Then you just torture a innocent man. People like you hold these country back. What is his name ? A paternity testing can easily prove him guilty Okay not gonna debate you about that but the fuck does that have to do with this case bro üòÇ Let me get this straight. They are forcing a child to give birth to a baby who will be removed from its mother and put in a state-run institution? And so it begins. A test that was not taken. Ya all have not read the article did you? I guess because the victim's name (the daughter) will easily come up if the man is named. So, protecting the victim's identity in a way? In-fucking-sane! Since it's so brutal thing and getting justice take so long ..in many countries , doctors themselves give some sort of medicine to terminate pregnancy to rape victims after taking consent from family members or the victim so there is no pregnancy to began with like turkey and etc... Why to make abortion so difficult that you need judicial people and then there is committee which will take the decision...such news will encourage the rapists ..rapists are sadist , they don't care if they get punishment , all they want to destroy the victim's life ...by doing he gets what he wants ..he trapped her with the baby for her entire life..and somewhere also destroy the baby life .. I am talking about testing after the birth of baby since the victim has been denied abortion anyway. Should they let mother die..? Capital Punishment is the only way Bro! The other guy was asking a rhetorical question. Rapists should be hanged to death they don‚Äôt deserve anything better (after being found guilty) This has always been the policy, fuck you mean ‚Äúso it begins?‚Äù The rules have actually gotten looser over the last few years. Wtf are you even talking about? What does atheism even have to do with any of this? What else do you want? Terminating at this point would be dangerous plus an 11 year old should not be burdened with motherhood. It's never been proven Capital Punishment reduces rape. Effective policing, victims not being afraid to come forward, rehabilitation for the victim, judicial system, consent based sex education (you'll be surprised how few people know what consent is) among are more effective. 32 weeks is risky It‚Äôs not at 32 weeks Can't blame the court it's better to save hem than risking both of their lives considering their is a huge number of fake rape cases, no they can‚Äôt simply just castrate someone. considering their is a huge number of fake rape cases in india, no they can‚Äôt simply just castrate someone. does it actually endanger her life? Just asking a question Ram mandir ko beech me mat laa...stop inserting it everywhere...mamla kya hai tu baat kya karra...your point wouldn't have made any less sense had you excluded ram mandir topic...tum logo ko sab jageh use lana hai...smh As a woman who keeps hearing about these cases every single day and also can't even feel safe to step out of her house in this country because of how men keep staring and harassing even if not all of them are raping women, I can't feel sorry. You get stared at so much. Harassment has become so common that some of the things men do aren't even considering too much anymore. Like groping and rubbing in trains and buses is \"normal\" now. üòëüòë Incest thing is taking troll, this not good. I‚Äôm pro choice as well but at 8 months it seems just too late? I myself was born pre term at 28 weeks. that kind of behaviour of some lowlifers disgust the shit out of me, but look at the other side of the coin too and no one deserves to be punished for something they never did. (aint no way i‚Äôm justifying rapists, they deserve to fucking burned alive) Yes because the amount of enthusiasm and attention ram mandir got from politicians is huge , there are many REAL issues out there which needs that much attention but politicians ko sirf ram ram karna hai, fucking clowns USA banta jara hai ye vo in the wrong sense No, there is a reason we have evolved to unlearn that kind of thought, maybe you need to complete your process. Her Body is also Not ready to Bear the risk of Abortion and infact there is High chance she might loose her Life Aborting the child rather than giving birth and Its Not new there have been past instances of Delivering at young age. But Aborting a 32 week is too risky that is almost a whole Fetues. So Govt made the right call Her life>>>childs life. Although these sick bastards should be hanged for raping her own daughter and Tramatizing her for life Thats not going to do anything other than inflict pain. The punishment for murder os death and yet people commit murder its not about the punishment. Even if you change the punishment its not going to change how many rapes occur. First men can evolve themselves into understanding consent and respect. Not sure why we women are expected to do the work on mankind's evolution while men still behave like animals. nahh.. populus punishment is better‚Ä¶ let the people decide what fate he deserves‚Ä¶ and by that i mean the victims Violating anyone's bodily autonamy is *not* normal. But, so is discrediting the perils of the men who go through false accusations despite being innocent. Have you seen the documentry, *Martyrs of the Marriage*? It clearly outlines the predicament that men face when women misuse those laws. I could make a counterpoint to your argument that women mostly marry men to use them, dump them, and run off with their money -- or threaten them with imprisonment over false accusations. The generalization doesn't feel nice now does it? If you watch the documentry, it would clearly show that false cases are overtaking a real ones by alot. Should I stop feeling sorry for the *real* women who go through such predicaments because women mostly just use men for their benfit? What we *need* to work on is developing our education system, spreading awareness of mutual consent, proper rehabilitation system. Making people aware of the gravity of such offences and its consequences on the victims -- men and women both. Any form of punishment -- physical, and capital -- isn't acting as a proper deterrent now, is it? We can clearly see that the ingrained system is flawed. Of course, after proper judicial trial, capital punishment/'castration' would be fine because they were *found* guilty. If that's how it is then broadcast it so everyone can see what will happen to them if they did so. Strong punishments or strong rewards can bring out any desired behaviour from any human being. Bulldozer action and Atik Ahmed death stopped dropped the crime rates in UP to all time low. Why is that? My statement wasn't for that man. I clearly mentioned no mercy to rapists. If he is a rapist then he deserves that, if he is innocent then it implies he isn't a rapist which further implies no punishment for him. Like no one knows what the punishment is. Punishment doesn't solve crime. No amount of punishment can not change the behaviour of a person. Have you seen the data. By how much has it dropped. Please show source. Men ? You just had to go full retard didn't you ? Us v/s Them ka ye joh tum facade bana dete ho har cheez ko, yehi adaat tumhe le doobegi ek din. Indian state doesn't have the money to bring them to right path . Keep the capital punishment intact get rid of trash from society india has enough cheap labour and unemployment issues We need to bring back public executions for child rapists. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around a father raping his own daughter. Only monsters are capable of such things. Depends on your end goal. If you want the rapist to suffer and regret what they did, hell, public execution might be helpful. For me, it's about reducing and eliminating child rapes and rapes in general. For that there are multiple changes that need to be brought about. I think that misusing rights that are meant for your protection and grants you power to confront the crime should be a crime itself. If some women 'X' filed false rape case against some man then if that man is found innocent then the woman 'X' who filed the case will face the punishment of raping someone. Everyday... We stoop even lower I think once these type of men see the consequences of raping people, they‚Äôll be more scared to commit such crimes. But the consequences need to be severe in the first place in order to deter these men. Jail for a few years won‚Äôt cut it. I'm talking about structural changes before rapes are even committed. I personally don't think rapists are born, a misogynistic society that makes them view women as objects creates them. With capital punishment you will kill one rapist, but what about the thousands being pumped into the world because they never understood what consent is, because it was never taught to them. Thank fucking god people like you are not responsible for justice. Your line of thinking is extremely barbaric and medieval. Your suggestion is entirely out of anger without considering anything else. Imagine if rape laws in India were equal for women and women couple be punished for rape. Now imagine a women gets convicted of rape and we apply your methods to her. The equivalent would be to permanently stitch her vaginal opening to the point it will only ever be able to pass menstrual blood from a tiny opening. Sounds gruesome but justified to you? Now imagine a few years later it turns out she was wrongly prosecuted. You will never be able to undo what you did to her. That person has to live her only life with a useless stitched up vagina. You cannot take a chance with your judgement when the punishment is so gruesome. The only reason I am flipping genders here is because believe it or not, it is easier to understand this from your own genders perspective. You can directly relate to it. Punishments like castration or any kind of mutilations are absolutely stupid, it breeds a society where these things start to feel normal to people. These kinds of punishments are unnatural and should always be treated as extreme and not the norm no matter how 'justified' they may seem in individual cases.Imagine the mutilation the mob would start doing because well the government does it in some cases so why not do the same to our enemies? The future generations will start using these kinds of mutilations to retaliate against each other for crimes of much lesser degree. In 50 years from now you will have people castrating/mutilating each other for theft. There is no going back once you open that gate. Now you are living in the dark ages. The fabric of society is more delicate than you think. Poor girl End goal is him feeling the pain. So yes, capital punishment is a start. That \" reducing and eliminating child rapes and rapes in general \" are just plain words with no action. We can go on about talking in circles but the victim needs immediate justice, not the law of averages and sweet words about how society needs multiple changes. Yea at 32 week is dangerous In that case i guess keeping the kid is fine. What matters is her health. > Govt made the right call Her life>>>childs life A lot of the time govt is pro life which is why it was concerning cause it should be as she wishes. In this case yes the gov is right (as long as the decision was made based on medical conditions and not their opinion on abortions :) ) Lmao what does atheism have to do with this?? ü§£ hinduism? yeah same yall want ram mandhir to be this international event that lasts days but if someone says something you don‚Äôt like ‚Äúcalm down it‚Äôs just a mandhir vroo‚Äù Ok so how are u going to change them , everything needs money Sweden with its correction hardly manges to change 5 percent of its rapist and their percapita income is beyond 50k USD and has highest rape rate even by indian standards. In Large country like india govt can't realistically save every soul even usa with 80k percapita decides to imprison people for years for every single step of rape to keep them in prison for most amount of time most of your arguments philosophica and not practical and their population is hardly 400mil. You want Sweden style sel correction system with ess than 3k usd, it hasn't worked yet and it will never work. Normal day in Rajasthan What I want to know is - how long did the judicial (police, courts etc) procedure took to make this conclusion? We are known for running the case for a long time unless you are a VIP (like Arnab Goswami) Putting people who rape in prison for life also hasn‚Äôt reduced the number of rapes. What‚Äôs your point? Should imprisoning rapists be gotten rid off as punishment well? Should they all be sent to a ‚ÄúRapist Rehabilitation Centre‚Äù? Capital punishment for the most heinous crimes is not to deter future behaviour, but to offer moral objectivity and getting rid of people who from society who don‚Äôt deserve to be in it. Who said what you want in terms of policing etc cannot be done while capital punishment is implemented upon perpetrators of the worst crimes? You‚Äôre right that rapists are to a degree probably a result of a misogynist society. But some are born that way. Same way that psychopaths are born and sociopaths are moulded in to be that way. Societies that aren‚Äôt misogynist overall have rapists too. Rich and highly educated people rose too. Epstein and his cabal of high-powered people abused underaged girls, the cabal being comprised of some of the most popular liberals on the planet. 32 weeks is too high for abortion. Once these type of men see the consequences of raping people, they‚Äôll be more prone to murdering the victims, so they don't come forward and accuse them. Please end this world. wow, the down vote said what words cannot describe. proves the point. Yes but at 32 weeks it's well beyond the safety limit It's already.....going to........ The progress is already posted Both I say, not like the mother is safe in her own home anyway. cut him into pieces I don‚Äôt fully agree with that. Sure, that could be the case, but I‚Äôve lived in countries like UAE and Qatar with strict laws that result in very low crime rates and safe cities. I think having lax laws, a snail-paced justice system, and low conviction rates, gives rapists and criminals in general the confidence to commit crimes. Look at El Salvador, a country that once had the world‚Äôs highest homicide rate and was pretty much ruled by gangs is now enjoying relative peace and safety after hundreds of thousands of men were thrown into prison after a new President came into power with a strong no-nonsense approach to gang violence. El Salvador's homicide rate thus decreased by nearly 70% percent in 2023. Of course, the way in which this was done was controversial internationally but the citizens of El Salvador themselves support the President because he was able to bring safety to the previously violence-torn country by doing this. We need such a leader in India too, who is able to swiftly make heinous criminals pay for their actions and bring safety back to the innocent citizens of the nation. But it‚Äôs just a pipe dream because that‚Äôs not what the common people care about. Even if she lives she has to relocate to another state or country Her life will be worse than death Do men who claim this genuinely not understand the difference between a false case and an acquittal? Do you have a medical source for this claim? Yes you can just search it online WTF .. should be in jail for life after 8 months? that's straight up murdering a baby, just because it's inside a womb doesn't change that abortion cases are fast tracked for obvious reasons for similar urgent pleas the provision is known as writ petition Sadly, It's true. A fully developed fetus brings hormonal changes in a mother's body. Despite how enraging this situation is, the poor girl will have to endure it. I do hope they don't try to get the fetus aborted by some baba or dai. That's even more dangerous and can be fatal for the girl. As for the man, there are ways for someone to 'die naturally' without anyone realizing what actually happened. I start ripping off something else, then go to the nails, eyes, etc From my experience on reddit: No. google and common sense... A pregnancy is 40 weeks so by week 32 its far too late to terminate a pregnancy do women like you even read and understand the whole situation before commenting shit about it? she‚Äôs talking about all the cases, not specifically about this one. This. For a country like ours, where politics absolves all crimes and where crime is the backbone of people in power, a drastic and hard hand approach is next to impossible. Rather it is the empowerment of the masses - via education, awareness and the legal support - which can give us a fighting chance of removing the muck of crime where those in power feel they can get away with everything without any consequential baggage. More punishment is not an effective deterrent to crime. Many studies have proven this. Rather, conviction rates go down because it‚Äôs hard to prove most crimes (including rape) to a degree of certainty to justify death penalty. I disagree with your first sentence entirely. I have lived most of my life in countries with extremely strict laws and could walk around alone late at night without any fear of getting murdered or raped. And in cases of incestual rape (like this one), it‚Äôs very easy to prove with certainty who the rapist was with a DNA test. No. But because capital punishment does nothing to reduce criminality, and the potential for harm due to mistakes by the state are greater, extending it to other crimes is a regressive act that has no value for anyone. Besides which, it can even incentivize worse crimes. If the punishment for rape and murder are the same, the rapist has even less incentive to keep their victim alive if they fear them testifying. Humans are animals too. And we‚Äôre such a large sample size of 8 billion. Every behaviour you can and cannot imagine exists. I want to cry. Yeah but you have upi so you're advanced enough for a little judgment. The girl had 8 months. Can you hear yourself or are you so fucking dumb. She is freaking 11. She didn't know anything. She got raped. It was her mom and relatives who realised and took her to the doctor. Please refrain from commenting if you can't use your brain on such sensitive topics. She can die during child birth as she is just 11. For a normal adult woman. For a 11 year old with severe mental trauma it would be different according to my common sense. Funny thing, I googled abortion 32 weeks and some cases came up instantly: I am sure I can find more. North Indians getting good name and credit for South Indians. Keep doing more damage hats off!! Wouldn‚Äôt Childbirth be more dangerous for a 11 year old than an abortion :/ The 11 year is a a fully grown baby too, she‚Äôs an autonomous child & childbirth is dangerous. Are you ok? Don't kill him to reduce rape. Kill him to punish raping his daughter Everything else I agree with I replied to you, not her. This ‚Äúhuge number of fake rape cases‚Äù comes from the failure to understand the very basic distinction between a fake case and an acquittal. Man, it would be even more dangerous for the little girl due to her age It would depend on the girl's condition and the doctors recommendations. In any case I don't support any legal interference to patient care (whatever that may be). I would think that under rape circumstances, especially this one, she should be able to abort her baby because she never wanted it in the first place, and the father won't even be there to take care of the baby. Gross. #Womensrights Really brother and i replied to her, not you. it was in the context of her original comment. Convert 32 weeks into months if you're finding it hard to understand. dumbfuck And? Then stop being idiot. Lmfao ok troll. Don't waste my time anymore with ad hominems. We need to start killing these rapists, nothing would change otherwise, monsters Stfu, adopt children if you care that much. The victim is 11,wtf is wrong with you. Exactly. It makes you no different from the monsters you are trying to punish. It shouldn't be normal to \"enjoy\" torturing someone. Capital punishments make sense but not torture. You made an incorrect statement, which I have quoted in my previous reply. I corrected that statement, nothing else. Bro how hard is to to comprehend how dangerous it would be to abort that late???? Lmfao you still haven't provided a single medical source to support your statement. This is really pathetic. This is what happrns when People uneducated in medicine comment about the safety of medical procedures. Interesting read but why does it sound so extr√™me There is no extreme really. Again no legal interference in people's private medical decisions."
