        "Unrestricted internet is one of the main cause of these things. Porn , hypersexualized short videos , lack of sex education these things are major factors.  Very less percentage of indians have internet literacy",
        "Sex Education will always be a taboo in this country. Unless we have educated leaders, and women leaders who can talk about these issues , unlike Smriti Irani and now Kangana who put down other women openly. \n\nNothing changes here, it‚Äôs sad to see the downfall of humanity in this country we call ‚ÄúBharat Mata‚Äù where women aren‚Äôt safe. \n\nWomen safety is a hoax and a joke in this country.",
        "Unrestricted cheap internet and very low internet literacy has become a major factor",
        "I think it's very ironic how discussion about sex is taboo while we have the highest population in the world",
        "We should teach kids sex ed asap. For some reason I feel stuff like good and bad touch isn't enough.",
        "How is that even possible",

        "We need sex education AND we need to make lessons out of men who think pedophilia is somehow a topic of ‚Äúdark jokes‚Äù. You can't just give sex education, and leave these horrible men out there to make jokes about raping girls under 10. Or just be openly misogynist and sexist. \n\nLook at comments of Indian men under any reel of a child. They're despicable comments with likes ranging anywhere between 300 to 2000.",
        "How the actual fuck is this society enabling this, sex-ed, a free gender society, and brutal punishments for abusers is needed to solve this.",
        "Nope. Just a child. A really fucked up one.",
        "Man this is so so disturbing. \n\nI don't want to sound like a jerk but I didn't know what sex is at the age of 11. This news is so so creepy.",
        "Ye banning shorts will work. Why not segregate males and females everywhere too?\n\nSex ed is what's needed. Shorts videos are not something seen only in india",

        "He was most likely being abused too... it would be different if he was atleast a teen, but him being 11 means that there is a good chance that he himself was being abused too.",

        "Personally, I do believe that pictures of babies and children should never be posted on Instagram and Twitter. It's a cesspool for pedophiles and horrible people. But also, a lot of parents do that to monetize their children's content, which is frankly very disgusting. There was an entire report on how a picture of a toddler ended up on the dark web, quite edited in a porn-ish pose. \n\nPosting little girls and boys online for a few likes, making content out of them, all of it is quite despicable. A lot of ‚Äúkid-centered‚Äù Instagram accounts also sell ‚Äúsubscribed content‚Äù. I don't need to explain what grown men (and women, in a few cases) are paying for.",

        "And that's an equally important issue for us too. Whenever men come out with their stories of how they were sexually harassed and abused, they're shamed by some other men who ‚Äúso badly wanted the same to happen to them‚Äù.\n\nIndia is not serious about sexual abuse against children, let alone people. But I still stand by my point that men in India (and all over the world) are normalising abuse against children in the name of ‚Äúdank‚Äù content and that needs to be issued too.",
        "Yes exactly, but oh well that's the type of world we live in",
        "Fuck these people, there's no excuse except pure evil and malice. An 11 year old is old enough to know raping and assaulting is bad. It's not porn, drugs or environment and we need to stop acting like these people are pure innocent souls on the wrong path, 11 year olds have become rapists, killers and much more and they're clearly on the path to and already evil.",
        "There's so many youtube channels out there with the objective to farm views catering to that type of audience. I have personally reported so many such channels but it's a whole dark network and the social media sites are up to no good.",
        "At this point I don‚Äôt even know if that will help. It almost feels like we need to start chemically castrating the whole population. This is insane.",

        "I mean if he was atleast a teenager I cpuld understand it being the influence of social media and the general societal culture regarding women and misogyny,  but he is 11, boys that age usually don't even have much sexual desire, and it's well documented that when children do such heinous acts it's usually due to having suffered sexual trauma of their own.\n\nThose who are physically abused often turn into bullies, and sexual abuse victims often turn into abusers themselves (creating a cycle of abuse). \n\nFor more details please look it up, I do not know much more than that, as I avoid going too deep into these holes..",
        "50K bookmarks on pictures of a 3 year old girl child on Twitter...these adults are NOT good in the head. Adults monetising their kids are horrible! Most of them have ‚Äúspecial monthly subscribed content‚Äù as well. And they're so backed up by these social media apps.",

        "We're fucked.",
        "Islam they learn early",
        "It isn't, I've been online since 10 and had completely unrestricted access back when the internet was the degenerate wild west, saw horrible things that I'd be ashamed to even say out loud (gore vidoes, executions, torture, people dying in horrible ways, things of that nature). Never ever thought of doing any of it, in fact it made me love life and people even more knowing how fragile life is and how fucked up the world can be. Hung out with drug users, still have a major problem but never ever hurt anyone or had the thought to do so. I do get angry but I'll yell and feel like shit for hours. If youtube shorts can make you rape, you're a shitty excuse of a human to begin with.",
        "11 year old? wtf wtf wtf\n\nThe exposure to cheap Internet has got a lot to do with this",
        "I mean discrimination and cussing is one thing, but raping a six year old, to the point of critical condition is another, children that age might cuss like no tomorrow and even discriminate, after all these are still quite formative years, and it's the responsibility of the parents to guide them through it, but rape is by NO means the same thing at all.",

        "It's the easiest thing in the world to believe. India is a rapist wonderland.",
        "Why does someone need to consume \"special monthly subscribed content\" of a CHILD? \n\nI remember there being a post on reddit where someone reported a bunch of these channels and sites to the police but I feel like this is such a huge problem it's impossible to tackle on an individual level. This needs to be dealt on a larger level. \n\nThe problem with social media sites is that they need constant regulation and these massive companies are unwilling to curb their engagement and ad revenue profits and therefore unwilling to tackle this problem too.",

He was a reflection of our fucked up society. 100% he has learned it from somewhere. \n\nEither he was himself being raped, or he was introduced to hardcore internet pornography (possibly even child pornography) by someone close to him and more experienced.",

        "Yeah anyone capable of rape needs to be castrated becuase we have that punishment for dogs so they don‚Äôt act aggressive, same principle should be for humans, humans who act the most aggressive should be castrated.\n\nAnd for all of you who say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just 11‚Äù he **raped** someone, so he was very well aware and knowingly made the decision, it‚Äôs better to just Castrate him at this age instead of letting him grow up into a monster.",
        "This guy is barely a teen. His mind is so messed up that sex education wouldn't have helped much. He probably even watches porn. This is clearly a lack of oversight on his parents part. They deserve to be booked for bad parenting. \n\nI am all for sex ed. But determining the right age at which children grasp the seriousness of the topic is crucial.",
        "The boy, alone, cannot be blamed for this. Authorities need to know where he learned such behavior. Did he witness something similar at his house? Has anyone in his social circle exposed him to such things. Unless we dig deeper into the issue and realize the real cause, we will never be able to solve the issue. This is disturbing as hell!",
        "Right bc those kind of cases dont exist in the west",

If not sexual abuse, it's still quite likely that something was deeply wrong in that 11 year old's home",

        "The classic take of Internet is the root cause of everything, situations like this happened way more before internet but went unnoticed and unreported, nowadays stuff like this is more talked and addressed with the right people held accountable because of the internet. \n\nThough I do agree that Sex Ed is important, and one thing more is to people raising their children right and parents being held accountable when stuff like this happens.\n\nAnd yes 11 year olds should have monitored internet at all times by their own parents.",
        "yeah, we should support killing every human on earth because 1% human did terrible things. How un-terrible you are.",

        "Starting young I see",
        "I agree that boys are exposed to that at that rough age only, but I think that while porn is extremely harmful for preteens and teens, it's still an EXTREME leap from that to this. LARGE amount of people nowadays consume porn, many teens and preteens might pick up misogynistic habits from it, but how many go out and rape a six year old to the point of critical condition?\n\nLook all I am saying is that while porn is bad, it takes a full on monster to do something like this, and when the perpetrator is this young, it's quite likely s/he is a victim too, at the very least there has to be something wrong in his home,  I am pretty sure I have a few scientific studies backing me here, but for the sake of my mental health, I would rather not go too deep into this hole, but you are free to look it up",

        "the solution to which would be parents not giving their young impressionable kids unrestricted access to social media until theyre of the age , people will make dark jokes no matter who it negatively effects we need to ensure that kids arent exposed to that",
        "this depends more on the upbringing than the generation u were born in",

        "Increasing punishment to death penalty will cause pedophiles to not just rape but rape AND murder the victims which is objectively worse and will be harder to prosecute if the body isn't found, this is why corporal punishment was abolished and murder decreased after it. \nBut yes we need to find a solution to this",
        "Damn, I didn't even had idea on what sex was at this age.....",
        "I don't think the puberty takes place at 11 years old in boys. The puberty in boys begins at 13. Even if he suffers from precocious puberty, it's highly unlikely that he'll be mature enough to do something like this. Either the news is biased and trying to sell something wrong or the age of this kid is wrong.",
        "Yeah... Pornographic Content is widely available and 18+ criteria is something that never even concerned by anybody....  \nthis growing popularity of early sex among minors will be causing such incidents in the future too",

Was it Florida that banned porn websites for <18yr and PornHub withdrew from the state. Very well, that's good.\nJust for discussion, should the parents of the boy be punished?",
        "No dude jio and porn ban came at a time. Before it was CDs, pendrive, people will always find a way. Many parents think their kids are innocent. With jio even apps like share it don't have any purpose. We'll always have that one in a million fkkr who goes to extreme levels.",

These kids probably get influenced by some bhaiya, while that bhaiya may not be a pedo or something, they definitely leave a mark on a curious child. And internet is there too, so you know.. i cannot explain further.\n\nBasically, Sex ed is what they require at a young age, near the start of their puberty or something, but financially weaker families consider such thing a taboo and will never discuss it with their child, the child gets this knowledge all by himself by some bhaiya or a friend or maybe internet, and such sources often exclude moral part of things.",

But when we take the whole picture, in the past few years people have come out in support of brutal rapists and there are politically backed.

Every person who learns about consent is one more person who has a higher chance of learning the importance of respect. From the other perspective, it also teaches a more resilient population who can set healthy boundaries. \n\nWhen consent-based education becomes the norm at population scale, it also breaks down toxic societal beliefs that condone coercion, disregard agency of individuals, or perpetuate victim-blaming. Those are all toxicities that exist in many traditional cultures including in India. \n\nThere is also a domino effect of empathy, by creating individuals who are generally more attuned to the experiences of others, I think it can lead to broader positive impacts within society. Knowing how to ask for consent, respect a \"no,\" and enthusiastically embrace a \"yes\" is all about instilling a sense of empathy that considers the full emotional and physical impact of one's actions on others.\n\nIt's fundamental groundwork. It's no panacea, because some people will still abuse the norms, but that's why it's important to change the norms at the scale of the entire population.",

The galti could be anything. For all we know, the galti in their heads could just be that there was sexual contact between two unmarried people. \n\nIf we think about it, which part of their lives would've required them to consider a woman's consent? They get their marriage arranged and then they knock up their wives. If you ask them if they'd taken their wives consent to do so, you know what the answer would be.

They may or may not have an in-built system for what is wrong and what is right but even then it is weak, especially when their sense or moral is put against an elder they trust and admire.  \n\nA normal, non-anti-social kid who watches porn at 9 may do nothing because he does it secretly and in his environment there's strong danger of punishment if he is caught. There is no encouragement. There is fear. But if the same 9 year old has an adult who treats it as a fun little thing even if secretive, the scenario significantly changes. The child gets validation and support. His role model (I mean the psychological term not sarcastically) has presented something in a good light. Watching porn is the way the adult is spending happy time with him. Probably the uncle also talks about r\\*pe or sexual assault as if it were a light-hearted or fun/funny thing. All sorts of factors including personality can add up.\n\nI'm not blaming porn, I'm saying cheap porn access might not be the direct cause of it but it is something that needs to be regulated because it is certainly not being used responsibly. We can teach consent, control the child's internet access, but we cannot control adults like this whom I don't even have the words to describe. Especially, kids born in poverty-stricken sections of society tend to be more vulnerable to such influence. We cannot curb poverty quickly and I'm not saying poor people should not be watching porn. But if regulating cheap internet is a quick fix to protecting freaking toddlers and babies then we should consider it more seriously.",

        "certainly agree with the last point. People are either against porn or think being vulgar all the time is a personality trait.   \nWith internet this cheap and porn getting easy access to all walks of life, there is a very strong need that sex education doesn't just teach about consent, but also how to approach porn in an appropriate manner. As long as society considers this stuff taboo we can't handle it. Porn may be repulsive in many people's eyes but the truth is that people are watching it anyway and we are facing the consequences of what happens when something as turbulent is left to spiral out of control and responsibility. And no, taking an anti-porn approach won't be of any help today, curious teens are going to find ways to do it anyway, if anything it would only add to the thrill of it. This is why schools should be having sex-ed education by people trained for it and they should actually talk to teens about porn covering all the aspects of it.",

    "light_cleaned_comments": "Auzar Kato saale ka...at 11 mereko, lulli ka function bas Susu karna hota hai pata tha... Smh Ban short video apps. It's creating a hyper sexualized society. Hard to believe that this is true Banning won't work Education system needs to bring comprehensive sexual education in school curriculum Education is good for health. This is diffrent, almost like drugs. Unrestricted internet is one of the main cause of these things. Porn , hypersexualized short videos , lack of sex education these things are major factors. Very less percentage of indians have internet literacy Sex Education will always be a taboo in this country. Unless we have educated leaders, and women leaders who can talk about these issues , unlike Smriti Irani and now Kangana who put down other women openly. Nothing changes here, it‚Äôs sad to see the downfall of humanity in this country we call ‚ÄúBharat Mata‚Äù where women aren‚Äôt safe. Women safety is a hoax and a joke in this country. Unrestricted cheap internet and very low internet literacy has become a major factor I think it's very ironic how discussion about sex is taboo while we have the highest population in the world We should teach kids sex ed asap. For some reason I feel stuff like good and bad touch isn't enough. How is that even possible True. That's the satan disguised as a child. You can't blame porn for this mate, the issue is deeper than unrestricted internet access Cow belt priorities. Kya chal kya raha hai Ramrajya main? We need sex education AND we need to make lessons out of men who think pedophilia is somehow a topic of ‚Äúdark jokes‚Äù. You can't just give sex education, and leave these horrible men out there to make jokes about raping girls under 10. Or just be openly misogynist and sexist. Look at comments of Indian men under any reel of a child. They're despicable comments with likes ranging anywhere between 300 to 2000. How the actual fuck is this society enabling this, sex-ed, a free gender society, and brutal punishments for abusers is needed to solve this. Nope. Just a child. A really fucked up one. Man this is so so disturbing. I don't want to sound like a jerk but I didn't know what sex is at the age of 11. This news is so so creepy. Ye banning shorts will work. Why not segregate males and females everywhere too? Sex ed is what's needed. Shorts videos are not something seen only in india True but part of the problem are also the parents/children who have unrestricted access to such apps and posting pictures of themselves so openly without any repercussions Metaphor. The fact that he is 11 probably means that he was being sexually abused most likely too, just a sad and tragic situation all around. 11 year old had to have seen and learnt this behaviour from somewhere‚Ä¶.. UP they learn early That's important too, however I think yall are overlooking the fact that the perpetrator being 11 means that HE was most likely being sexually abused by someone too He was most likely being abused too... it would be different if he was atleast a teen, but him being 11 means that there is a good chance that he himself was being abused too. Had the parents gotten more involved in the kid‚Äôs life, this might have been prevented. Why so? Mai to cartoon dekhta tha class 4 me . Ye kya ho Raha hai yaar Desh me. Dhyan de yaar parents bacche pe. Earning kitni bhi ho lekin aisa kuch ho gya to phir sab 0 hai. Personally, I do believe that pictures of babies and children should never be posted on Instagram and Twitter. It's a cesspool for pedophiles and horrible people. But also, a lot of parents do that to monetize their children's content, which is frankly very disgusting. There was an entire report on how a picture of a toddler ended up on the dark web, quite edited in a porn-ish pose. Posting little girls and boys online for a few likes, making content out of them, all of it is quite despicable. A lot of ‚Äúkid-centered‚Äù Instagram accounts also sell ‚Äúsubscribed content‚Äù. I don't need to explain what grown men (and women, in a few cases) are paying for. We are evolving into a completely new species.... Indian culture needs reform Exactly. He was a victim and now he is a rapist. What? Unbelievable This is again what‚Äôs wrong with the country. Instead of addressing the real issue, we make everything regional and religion based. Stop this BS. He is from the same India where you belong! It‚Äôs the name of the country that goes down not just the region. Bass hindu-muslim, north-south karwalo inse Mujhe 4thi me ladka ladki me (reproductive ) difference nhi pata tha bc aur yaha 11 saal ke launde saale. Where did we go wrong? Ease of pornography ig. Climate change: could you please destroy the earth sooner? I used to pray to God to do that but that failed lol so now I am counting on you. And that's an equally important issue for us too. Whenever men come out with their stories of how they were sexually harassed and abused, they're shamed by some other men who ‚Äúso badly wanted the same to happen to them‚Äù. India is not serious about sexual abuse against children, let alone people. But I still stand by my point that men in India (and all over the world) are normalising abuse against children in the name of ‚Äúdank‚Äù content and that needs to be issued too. Yes exactly, but oh well that's the type of world we live in Fuck these people, there's no excuse except pure evil and malice. An 11 year old is old enough to know raping and assaulting is bad. It's not porn, drugs or environment and we need to stop acting like these people are pure innocent souls on the wrong path, 11 year olds have become rapists, killers and much more and they're clearly on the path to and already evil. There's so many youtube channels out there with the objective to farm views catering to that type of audience. I have personally reported so many such channels but it's a whole dark network and the social media sites are up to no good. At this point I don‚Äôt even know if that will help. It almost feels like we need to start chemically castrating the whole population. This is insane. I don't think so, I'm from U.P. and kids here are just wild. Discrimination and cussing comes before alphabets here. ( Yeah, I'm not talking about privileged kids ) This does nothing rather than shift responsibility to someone that doesn't exists. I mean if he was atleast a teenager I cpuld understand it being the influence of social media and the general societal culture regarding women and misogyny, but he is 11, boys that age usually don't even have much sexual desire, and it's well documented that when children do such heinous acts it's usually due to having suffered sexual trauma of their own. Those who are physically abused often turn into bullies, and sexual abuse victims often turn into abusers themselves (creating a cycle of abuse). For more details please look it up, I do not know much more than that, as I avoid going too deep into these holes.. 50K bookmarks on pictures of a 3 year old girl child on Twitter...these adults are NOT good in the head. Adults monetising their kids are horrible! Most of them have ‚Äúspecial monthly subscribed content‚Äù as well. And they're so backed up by these social media apps. The accused kid was muslim. We're fucked. Islam they learn early It isn't, I've been online since 10 and had completely unrestricted access back when the internet was the degenerate wild west, saw horrible things that I'd be ashamed to even say out loud (gore vidoes, executions, torture, people dying in horrible ways, things of that nature). Never ever thought of doing any of it, in fact it made me love life and people even more knowing how fragile life is and how fucked up the world can be. Hung out with drug users, still have a major problem but never ever hurt anyone or had the thought to do so. I do get angry but I'll yell and feel like shit for hours. If youtube shorts can make you rape, you're a shitty excuse of a human to begin with. 11 year old? wtf wtf wtf The exposure to cheap Internet has got a lot to do with this I mean discrimination and cussing is one thing, but raping a six year old, to the point of critical condition is another, children that age might cuss like no tomorrow and even discriminate, after all these are still quite formative years, and it's the responsibility of the parents to guide them through it, but rape is by NO means the same thing at all. I just can't anymore üòî Kids these days have easy access to porn on phones, parents don't give a fuck about monitoring them. Yaa the completely agree. It's the easiest thing in the world to believe. India is a rapist wonderland. Why does someone need to consume \"special monthly subscribed content\" of a CHILD? I remember there being a post on reddit where someone reported a bunch of these channels and sites to the police but I feel like this is such a huge problem it's impossible to tackle on an individual level. This needs to be dealt on a larger level. The problem with social media sites is that they need constant regulation and these massive companies are unwilling to curb their engagement and ad revenue profits and therefore unwilling to tackle this problem too. jiowasamistake This country protested when there were talks of teaching sex education in schools.... Now this is happening...who could have thought. seriously ya it‚Äôs getting terrible day by day I am by no means trying to do \"whataboutary\" over here, I was simply addressing a few of these comments over here which were calling that 11 year old Satan, when I think it's quite likely he was a victim too, quite possible been abused multiple times himself. I replied to your comment specifically because while your original comment was talking about the sad reality of social media, lack of sex ed and the general Indian mindset, I wanted to just point out that this case perhaps may entail more details than just that. dude born yesterday These kinds of metaphors just serve to hide the rot in our society. He is not a monster, neither is he satan‚Äôs spawn. He was a reflection of our fucked up society. 100% he has learned it from somewhere. Either he was himself being raped, or he was introduced to hardcore internet pornography (possibly even child pornography) by someone close to him and more experienced. How does good touch bad touch help when you‚Äôre being raped‚Ä¶ At 11 person can cum too? I studied puberty starts at 13? Inn kutton ki kaat deni chaiye. Forever saza What de fuck. I'm pretty sure the 11 year old is himself a victim of some sort of abuse, probably sexual; kids don't just do this shit outta nowhere You dont sound like a jerk at all from this. It is absolutely terrifying for sure Class 4 mai erection kaise aarha unko? mai toh games khelne ka sochta tha ye toh bc sidha crime krrhe Possible. My bad ig. How does an 11 year old get an erection? I don‚Äôt even remember if I had erection at 11. It depends from person to person. Also CAN be precocious puberty (started earlier) Yeah anyone capable of rape needs to be castrated becuase we have that punishment for dogs so they don‚Äôt act aggressive, same principle should be for humans, humans who act the most aggressive should be castrated. And for all of you who say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just 11‚Äù he **raped** someone, so he was very well aware and knowingly made the decision, it‚Äôs better to just Castrate him at this age instead of letting him grow up into a monster. This guy is barely a teen. His mind is so messed up that sex education wouldn't have helped much. He probably even watches porn. This is clearly a lack of oversight on his parents part. They deserve to be booked for bad parenting. I am all for sex ed. But determining the right age at which children grasp the seriousness of the topic is crucial. The boy, alone, cannot be blamed for this. Authorities need to know where he learned such behavior. Did he witness something similar at his house? Has anyone in his social circle exposed him to such things. Unless we dig deeper into the issue and realize the real cause, we will never be able to solve the issue. This is disturbing as hell! Right bc those kind of cases dont exist in the west Wtf is happening in India. How and why would a 11 year old even know what rape is. Definitely po*n Huh? I am Danish/European and we didn't go around raping 6-year-old girls before we had sex ed. I am subscribed to the r\\/Denmark, r\\/Europe, and the subreddits of the BRICS countries like r\\/India and this is the only place I read hourly rape news. Seems like the problem is unique to India and not due to the lack of sex ed. Definitely Jio was a mistake What the fuck is happening to this society? Not necessarily. With access to smart phones young kids don't have to struggle to watch bad stuff. Ffs RAPE and SEX is not the same. Sex education doesn‚Äôt stop rapes. Rape is a violent act against women. parents are allowing phones to 5 year olds. What could possibly go wrong. THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS Or men How nobody is questioning that how a 11 year old could think of raping somebody? r/jiowasamistake That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the point the original commenter made Good job I think ur a bit mistaken there,that's like the average age where boys get introduced to all that stuffs(nowadays it's even younger)but yeah what u said could be true too I mean yea, and if they do it then they are expected to embibe some misogynistic things in their behaviour and language, but it's still a bug leap from that to this. Almost all teens and even preteens now a days are exposed to porn one way or the other, many regularly consume it and pick up extremely bad things from it, but still how many 11 year Olds do something like THIS. If not sexual abuse, it's still quite likely that something was deeply wrong in that 11 year old's home You two nincompoops share the same freaking brain cell >sex education Wtf? This is the second comment about sex ed. Other 3rd world countries don't have hourly rape news like India despite lacking sex ed. I am Danish/European and we didn't go around raping 6-year-old girls before we had sex ed. I read a lot of news. I am subscribed to the r/Denmark, r/Europe, and the subreddits of the BRICS countries like r/India. This is the only place I read hourly rape news. Seems like the problem is unique to India and not due to the lack of sex ed. At this point, these kind of news are not at all suprising. ik those insta dank comments most of time arent meant to be taken seriously but when you start trivilising it and making jokes on it even if you have no ill intention,a kid is impressionable. all those r word jokes or fatherless or belt treatment and this is how literal kids take it The classic take of Internet is the root cause of everything, situations like this happened way more before internet but went unnoticed and unreported, nowadays stuff like this is more talked and addressed with the right people held accountable because of the internet. Though I do agree that Sex Ed is important, and one thing more is to people raising their children right and parents being held accountable when stuff like this happens. And yes 11 year olds should have monitored internet at all times by their own parents. yeah, we should support killing every human on earth because 1% human did terrible things. How un-terrible you are. As an outsider I feel Indians refuse to acknowledge that they have a unique rape problem. No other country, neither poor nor rich country, has new hourly rape news. But they definitely exist in middle East. Hang him Um. I've had unrestricted internet my entire life. If few Indians have internet access, are you sure it's not lack of porn causing this...? Starting young I see I agree that boys are exposed to that at that rough age only, but I think that while porn is extremely harmful for preteens and teens, it's still an EXTREME leap from that to this. LARGE amount of people nowadays consume porn, many teens and preteens might pick up misogynistic habits from it, but how many go out and rape a six year old to the point of critical condition? Look all I am saying is that while porn is bad, it takes a full on monster to do something like this, and when the perpetrator is this young, it's quite likely s/he is a victim too, at the very least there has to be something wrong in his home, I am pretty sure I have a few scientific studies backing me here, but for the sake of my mental health, I would rather not go too deep into this hole, but you are free to look it up bruv how in the world is this even agreed. not sounding like a jerk. it is just hard to fathom coming from a different generation Humans, apparently we don‚Äôt learn early The parents deserve same punishment as the boy, if not harder. If you can not raise a decent human, you don‚Äôt deserve to reproduce. Such people are burden on the society. 11 years old, that's terrifying honestly. How does he even know about such a heinous crime at such a young age the solution to which would be parents not giving their young impressionable kids unrestricted access to social media until theyre of the age , people will make dark jokes no matter who it negatively effects we need to ensure that kids arent exposed to that this depends more on the upbringing than the generation u were born in I'm saying it again and again, Porn is the cause of this. Many idiots I see are defending it. Guys it's not UP or Bihar. It's Porn. i dont know about you, but sex ed doesnt usually only talk about sex - for young kids it wont even be mentioned - but we should talk about consent, thats not controversial I watched first explicit movie after 12th class and 1st contact at 21. Delayed exposure helped in my case. Feeling sorry for both. Where I‚Äôm from, stuff like consent was included in our sex ed. Nobody said otherwise tho ? I agree but I find many people actually defending porn as if it's normal. No it's not. The thing is I am fed up with all this negativity on the internet I loathe religious extremism from any side I hate bajrang dal and VHP while they moral police couple and I hate Islamic groups who spew hate against India and I hate the madarsa where no substantial education is provided to Muslim children and their heads are filled with religious extremism and that is one of the most contributing factor for cases like these. But some people don't wanna address these issues they like to play the victim and shifting blame why not address the root of the problem which is lack of proper education. This is just a figure of speech dude. Lighten up a little or are you in a perpetual fighting mode? isliye early age mein sex education important hai This is what happens when kids see things adults do and just follow in their steps We as a nation lack the knowledge of basic interaction with the opposite gender and also of good touch bad touch, kehne se kuch nahi hoga idhar what ever we can do like educate children in schools and colleges should be done. Increasing punishment to death penalty will cause pedophiles to not just rape but rape AND murder the victims which is objectively worse and will be harder to prosecute if the body isn't found, this is why corporal punishment was abolished and murder decreased after it. But yes we need to find a solution to this Damn, I didn't even had idea on what sex was at this age..... I don't think the puberty takes place at 11 years old in boys. The puberty in boys begins at 13. Even if he suffers from precocious puberty, it's highly unlikely that he'll be mature enough to do something like this. Either the news is biased and trying to sell something wrong or the age of this kid is wrong. Yeah... Pornographic Content is widely available and 18+ criteria is something that never even concerned by anybody.... this growing popularity of early sex among minors will be causing such incidents in the future too How would you go about making lessons out of people who use dark humour or are openly misogynist and sexist ? How does an 11yo get an erection. Does that thing work at that age? Honestly, I wonder how could he have raped at all? I don't even think his penis works at his age which leads me to believe that he probably inserted some foreign object and that's even more terrifying biologically. I am so creeped out by this I can't even think of it. exactly im def not giving my kids ipads or phones the way parents these days do. kids are overexposed and the internet cant be contained Wtf is going on... 11 year old? I'd be ok if there are no porn sites and all lewd material is taken off internet if it prevents poisoning a young child's brain. Putting all of world's information in hands of such impressionistic minds should be ILLEGAL. Was it Florida that banned porn websites for <18yr and PornHub withdrew from the state. Very well, that's good. Just for discussion, should the parents of the boy be punished? No dude jio and porn ban came at a time. Before it was CDs, pendrive, people will always find a way. Many parents think their kids are innocent. With jio even apps like share it don't have any purpose. We'll always have that one in a million fkkr who goes to extreme levels. Yes. sex-ed is not going to help children of all ages. What the fuck did I just read??? A fucking 11 year old???! Jesus Christ‚Ä¶. He is not 11..More likely 15-16.. Age fudgeing is common in India. I myself completed class 10 at 21 y real age Isn't rape \"forced sex\"? How does violence equal rape? god, p\\*rnography is killing the youth This country is unsavable‚Ä¶ 11 year age me mein COC khelta tha, computer games and computer me interested tha and power rangers enjoy karta tha, BC ye kya ho gya h duniya ko, new parents kya itne soft and unconcerned ho gye h kya? >but rape is by NO means the same thing at all. You and I could understand. These kids probably get influenced by some bhaiya, while that bhaiya may not be a pedo or something, they definitely leave a mark on a curious child. And internet is there too, so you know.. i cannot explain further. Basically, Sex ed is what they require at a young age, near the start of their puberty or something, but financially weaker families consider such thing a taboo and will never discuss it with their child, the child gets this knowledge all by himself by some bhaiya or a friend or maybe internet, and such sources often exclude moral part of things. Yeah, blame the men for something that little bastard did. If both parents stay together and raise their children well, while living as a good example, most crimes would be non-existent. If the sex education also includes teaching kids about the importance of consent and how to get consent, it would definitely help. Not a silver bullet for the issue but the suggestion you responded to isn't as crazy as your comment makes it seem you think it is. Class 4 11 yr ? He should be criminally abused now, Leashes are required in the name of making people of India more civilized. This is such a heinous crime, that is a 11yo monster to me If you dont teach about sex than curiosity of doin such incident increases specially for younger ones UP being UP I‚Äôm leaving this country ‚Ä¶ Do you want an entire class/caste analysis, along with how when went unpunished men go brazenly abusing women? Men in India are garlanded when they rape women from marginalised background. A huge number of women who are violated either belong to marginalised background or religious minority. But when we take the whole picture, in the past few years people have come out in support of brutal rapists and there are politically backed. There's no repercussions for criminals, so of course, they're getting out there more. When there's no law and order, what's stopping people in power from ruining lives of those who don't have the same power and privilege as them? This goes unnoticed because laws in India are women favoured Disagree. A proper sex education should talk about consent. We can start with ACTUALLY punishing men who rape women. Let's start by not taking rallies out in support of rapists and garlanding them and giving them parole 6 times in a week. And then we can go about taking reported accounts seriously. true What in the actual F**k üò® Not had to have seen and learnt!!! The boy lives in India and that is enough reason! Welcome to India!!!! They r using vpn to circumvent porn ban. Perils of technology. Parents of that boy must also be punished severely as they are equally responsible for having a demon go unchecked. Gen alpha is getting out of hand Nah just make the females cover up, that's causing all the issues /s Huh? Ever heard of South America? It happens in other countries too. However, India has some unique traits: 1. It's one result (but not the only problem, but it did help exacerbate it) of [400 million mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio) rapidly getting introduced into the country (so many people having internet access to the first time), but the same people not having exposure to western-style sex-ed in schools, because a \"sexual revolution\" still needs to happen. So a lot of naive people got unfettered access to porn, and it gave them unrealistic expectations of what healthy sex is. It's not unlike kids who get access to porn too early in the west. 2. The Indian media is gigantic, and much of it new in the last 10 years, and lot of it is in English too. Inevitably, you're going to hear about more stuff that happens in India except for the US if you speak English. Nah that ain't enough man. Lock them all up in the kitchen Children imitate what they see and hear around them... The world is too dirty and children's minds should be safeguarded by parents. This is disturbing... The adults who rape should be castrated and hung first of all... To set an example that rape is a punishable by death offense.... Rape is a violence issue than a sex issue See a 11 year old boy, but the article would have named him if he was Muslim It looks like you lack education as well since your first comment was literally just blaming it all on one religion. you sure that rape is against women ? 11 year old boy? Either the boy isn‚Äôt actually 11 or something fishy is going on here. Yep. And people saying p-rn, need to know that, that boy might also have been sexually abused by someone. Possibly someone he knows or meets everyday. I agree but Is that what we are talking about right now? Make a separate thread for it instead of invading this. Child-on-child sexual abuse most likely happens because the abuser has experienced something similar, or has some other psychological disorders going on. I think most of the time, both can be spoken of. But porn doesn't Randomly lead someone, even a child, to just do something like that to another child. There's definitely more going on. Please kind sir you are so wise so well educated can you explain me what is the actual reason for these type of incidents. Ye apna desh kis tarf Jaa rha hai..ü•≤ This. I agree they do refuse the problem. Instead of addressing the issue and doing something about it, they care more about the ‚Äúinternational reputation‚Äù than the victims. We are in dire need of a huge social reform. Sorry not a specialist in psychology. I think porn is a very acceptable to release sexual tension . But sex education regarding porn is very important in indian society Idk how can people read this and still think men being predators isn't an inherent trait. Men are just extremely dangerous no matter how old they are Consent comes after seeing women as human beings and not just disposable objects. Grown educated rich adults have allegedly raped women, do you think they don‚Äôt know about consent? They damn well do but the problem is they think women are disposable and not equal human beings. I obviously agree with everything you said, but that is not what I asked. You gave a statement that rape is a violent act against women. Which means it's done only to women and not men. I genuinely think sex education is most important. Yes internet also has helped people to deal with problems be it mental , physical or sexual but it very much depends on one's mentality and how he or she uses it . I've seen people start a very healthy and long term relationship where they met online and also people get murdered by the person they met online sad but true, in no way discounts the importance of sex ed or education in general [Read this I can‚Äôt type again](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/XKvWQJLlRI) [Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/XKvWQJLlRI) valid point Shit. That is so saddening. I hope they don't treat him as juvenile. Also So worried about the future of the girl and her mental state. I have a 4 year old so all I feel is anguish and extreme anger towards that boy and his parents. They do, I've faced it. \"Oh address the real issue\" forever y'all MFS just say this to escape the situation and stay quiet until someone else does this to you or your family then sit back watch everyone \"address the issue\" I 100% agree. Sex education should be mandatory but that is not the solution for rape culture in India is what I‚Äôm trying to say. We need a huge huge social and cultural reform in our country. Class 4?! How the hell? I also had unrestricted internet access since i was 10 years old but i think it really depends on what's his or her mentality is how they use the information available on the internet. Have you seen the comments of indian uncles on a reel of a woman who shows a bit of skin and dances on the internet? Their children can use that information in two ways either they can follow the footsteps of their elders or they can learn how not to behave rudely with women and how to make them feel safe. It all depends on sex education amd morality I have no time for this BS. you do you. [Read](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/XKvWQJLlRI) There should be a study on this ! & I wasn‚Äôt criticising what they wrote.. instead pray for giving everyone good conscience. and for a beautiful world. I agree. Also it's because of western influence and internet literacy we failed in with current technology. Porn is widely available everywhere, but this shit doesn‚Äôt happen there. I think maybe it might not be porn. I agree w/ you, that there should be a lot of reflection on broader misogyny, but I think sexual education is still important to emphasize, since kids should learn that sex should be about intimacy between people rather than gratification (which is what most porn promotes). The worst thing is to have people learn about sex from porn. What‚Äôs the big deal this is an average Tuesday in India. It‚Äôs surprising it wasn‚Äôt a gangrape Yes I have seen women are treated very badly in India, I've never understood why. It‚Äôs literally India u/ineha_ commented \"Idk how can people read this and still think men being predators isn't an inherent trait. Men are just extremely dangerous no matter how old they are\" And women are insanely manipulative no matter how old they are. Never trust them. /s When mobile phones are given to children unchecked, they get exposed to everything. animaal and kabir Singh üí©üí©üí© UP is fucking mental I didn‚Äôt know how to jerk probably. It‚Äôs just disturbing where this country is going India's internet is breeding rapists. Bhai. 6th class hui 11 year old. Baccha failure ya late hai correct age 6th ki hoti hai 11. Heinous crime mai bas clear kar raha tha Subah se abhi reddit khoka tha after a tired day üò¢üò¢ Well you have Reddit so porn access is not that hard. I felt like I could be a jerk for writing that unnecessary fact about me not knowing sex at 11 yrs old. I don't think that 11 year old knows what is rape Man, I don't want to call an entire country fucked up, but it feels like I only see bad news coming out of India. What a day to be literarate. I don't know why you're linking your comment in another conversation as a response to mine when your next comment in that conversation asks for \" a huge huge social and cultural reform in our country.\" What do you think social and cultural reform looks like? Make everyone pinky promise to not rape? No, it's teaching kids about the importance of consent amongst a thousand other things that work together to create a population that is more averse to rape. I specifically said that sex education is not a silver bullet. It is, however, a necessary part of that reform you seem to want. Definitely! Sex education is important and should be provided but I genuinely don‚Äôt think that will resolve rape issues in our country. What the fuck Does a 11 year old boy's equipment work the same way as a grown ass man's?? Asking out of curiosity..... r/antipornography This disrespect of women or toruture of women is very common among south asian and south american denizens but i think due to the total density of Indian population the total number of cases also increases. I mean if you take number of cases per lakh of people it will always be higher for India with respect to either Bangladesh or Peru Did I say anything about pinky promise? Did I say anything about how to reform our society? Your comments reeks of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than her and let me put her down by making dumb unfounded comments‚Äù. India largely is heavily misogynistic and our ‚Äútraditions‚Äù are too. Changing the culture one by one will have trickle down effect in the coming generations because it won‚Äôt happened overnight and yes sex education is important when did I say it is not? Oh I know‚Ä¶in your imagination. Tbh I've only ever seen the stories on the news are the ones in India, had no idea it was that bad in south Asia and South America in general. Doesn‚Äôt surprise me if true The concept of consent and why it's important is covered in Sex Ed. i dont think the boy is 11 at all must be a teenager even a preteen is hard to believe And the majority is muslim üíÄ Oh really? Fuck I did not know that. Thank you for that valuable brand new information. Not sure where this myth about women being manipulative comes from. I am reaching conclusions based on real data unlike you. 50% of the population committing 99% of the sexual crimes. Also a 11 year old could not have learnt this from any external sources so it had ot be inherent. Yup. In my imagination...and in your unnecessarily aggro initial comment to someone simply saying we need sex education for kids. But it just seems like you want to be angry so have fun with that. I'm sure you'll find lots of things to impotently shake your fist at on Reddit. Ayo WTF is going on bro, this rape shit is getting out of hand now how a 11 year old is so horny that he can't even resist this shit and proceeds to rape a 6 year old girl smh, this type of news really makes my suck my teeth bro my prayers to the Victim and their family members, I can't even imagine what she had to go thru. This is really saddening üôèüèæüò≠ >Porn is the cause of this Why developed countries consume far more porn per capita yet ,they have lower rate of sexual violence For example Japan which has one the Highest consumption of pornographic content has the lowest rate of sexual violence All Indians have pornhub app installed on their phones....even kids and 80 yr olds. All Indians have pornhub app installed on their phones....even kids and 80 yr olds. I'm so glad someone knows about COCSA. The comments on this are just deplorable. There's something seriously wrong with men in India. Something wrong with the way they are raising and teaching young boys if this is the result. baap ek numberi beta dus numbri, definitely parents are scum. up cops are more corrupt If they could not find culprit they will pin it on anyone they can at age of 11 I thought humans reproduced through pollen like plants do. bruhhhhhhhhh But does this small boy has sexual feelings...and idk what to ask...Am surprised shocked and angry. Maybe. Maybe not. But I‚Äôm pretty sure he was exposed to such videos on the Internet Me neither. I understood the mechanism of sex when I was like 14 or 15. This is very disturbing. Bhay 11 saal mein mujhe koi idea nhi tha in sab cheezon ka bas thodi bhot gaaliyan jaanta tha unka bhi matlab malum nhi tha, it wasn't until 14-15 that I got to know about these things What the fuck Damn I use to watch Ben 10 at that Age nd this FK wierdo r*ping a literal child Wtf is wrong with this gen. Man It's horrible...as a woman I feel super unsafe. WHATTT...... But aajkal toh 5th ka bachcha gaali detta h....kalyug at peak Yep Hindu ethics should be followed, not secular(or better to say Satanic) ethics Why wouldn't they care about their reputation? I would be ashamed if I was Indian. Reputation, both as an individual and as a group, is an important driver of human and societal development. Humans are wired on a fundamental level to care what others think about us. Not using that as a motivation and driver is stupid. Literally Unbelievable, must have been related to CP or someone is lying placing the blame on a child Wow.... What happened to all Indians are my brother and sister. The parents of the boy are to blame for this. If only they had properly educated their child. Surprised he didn‚Äôt get all his buddies to join in. Or is that just what the grown men there do? Wonder where he learned this behavior‚Ä¶ Now where do you pull that from ? The country w more rape are western country US, England and France ? 11 years old but class four? He should have have been in class six. Why he is two years behind must have something to do with his unruly behavior. He is not 'normal' for his age. The consequences of a secular country to children.India should again have Hindu theocracy, not this Wtf yaar. It's been decades of this bs in this country. These news are just disturbing. What kind of influence teaches an 11 year old to rape? It's absolutely horrifying. Can we reboot the whole UP state? People in the comments who are expressing shock and commenting the usual thing of comparing themselves at the age of 11, tend to overlook a few things: 1) that, times then and now are quite different. Children as small as 3 are being handed a mobile *without proper supervision* 2) puberty is fragile. Hence the need for proper *Sex Education* and equal awareness among the child's guardians is very very important. A number of studies like [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761219/#:~:text=If%20expressed%20interest%20in%20sex%20is%20a,more%20frequent%20sexual%20cognitions%20than%20women%2C%20but) point out the fact that >If expressed interest in sex is a marker of sexual desire, less than 2% of 9‚Äì10 year old boys express an interest in having sexual intercourse, but this proportion is 12% among 13‚Äì14 year olds. This proportion is 2% or less for girls (Arnal & Llario, 2006). What can we as adults do? 1. **Open Communication** 2. **Age-Appropriate Information** 3. **Answer Questions Honestly** 4. **Respect Privacy** 5. **Discuss Consent** 6. **Body Positivity** 7. **Address Safety** 8. **Media Literacy** In essence, it's about fostering open communication, providing accurate information, and promoting healthy attitudes towards sexuality. I have a brother that age and I am worried when I read such news as should every adult be, for their loved ones... Cant tell if this is satire or true Aint no way you said that ü´† Guess everybody loves sensationalist shit . Especially when it comes from up He could just as easily have been exposed to child sexual exploitation material through some telegram group or such. This s is true at least for all the 90s born And this is still true in villages and remote are It's called lack of maturity Ask your friends their certificate vs real age.. You will find some Ma to soch Raha ho sala ka nunnu bhi itna choota hoga How can he do such a thing Frick his friends and parents And why we will call you jerk???? It's not a quick fix, but it's the long game... teaching consent won't magically end rape overnight. But social change is about winning those small battles, right? Every person who learns about consent is one more person who has a higher chance of learning the importance of respect. From the other perspective, it also teaches a more resilient population who can set healthy boundaries. When consent-based education becomes the norm at population scale, it also breaks down toxic societal beliefs that condone coercion, disregard agency of individuals, or perpetuate victim-blaming. Those are all toxicities that exist in many traditional cultures including in India. There is also a domino effect of empathy, by creating individuals who are generally more attuned to the experiences of others, I think it can lead to broader positive impacts within society. Knowing how to ask for consent, respect a \"no,\" and enthusiastically embrace a \"yes\" is all about instilling a sense of empathy that considers the full emotional and physical impact of one's actions on others. It's fundamental groundwork. It's no panacea, because some people will still abuse the norms, but that's why it's important to change the norms at the scale of the entire population. So , what I know the saturation of these kind of cases is high in some parts of India , but it doesn't mean you can generalise South Africa, Somalia,even uk have worse cases but they are just not reported or discussed What we have done to our society...11 year old kid is doing this heinous crime. We elders are responsible for this. You‚Äôre loud & wrong lol! Go read why the camera shutter sounds in phones cannot be disabled in Japan. Or maybe just don't trivialize atrocities. That works better. nah it‚Äôs porn. I don't know what's the solution to this anymore. I am sick of all this now. That 11yo boy is being exposed to a lot of things that too in the worst way possible. And parents thought their child is \"too young\" to be taught about sex or periods. How dumb! Monkey see, monkey do \"we need to start chemically castrating the whole population\" yea i dont think that's a good idea. Bhai mara ko sex ka bara ma 10th ma pata chala tha Aur ajj kal ka baccha.... Chee bro I wanna leave this country asap Mara ko itna taak gussa a Raha ha ki kissi ko mukka marr do bass Probably him Must be video games... #BanFortnite kya.pata bhai Lekin he.learnt it somewhere ya.toj.irl ya.fir. internet üõú internet access nahi dena chahiye kids ko For putting the unnecessary info of me not knowing sex at 11. hmm yeh bhi hai 2 saal piche chalrha hai ye Fir bhi bohot small age hai Isko kya saza hogi waise. ? Me not knowing sex at the age of 15 ;( You think India is reporting every case but the UK isn‚Äôt? Nope Every Indian case is being discussed on social media platforms like this but UK 's isn't , you believe or not there is excessive hate about India and Indians on the internet Bhai disturbed ! Girl pe kya beet rhi hogi Yaar 11 saal ke bachhe toh innocent reh jate Totally agree with this. This 11year old child has been sexualized. Man India really is a breeding ground for the worst people on this earth.. Not ready to join the rest of us on the world stage India had an excessive problem with rape, more so than other places Even Insta is soft porn I'd say there's a pretty good case to be made that the problem is that they dont even have a concept of consent. Every time I saw locals/village elders interviewed after a gruesome rape or similar event occured in some super rural part of UP, MP etc., the one thing that stood out to me (in addition to the usual victim blaming shit) is that they never mention rape itself as the crime that occured. you hear some variation of 'it takes two hands to clap', and the rape referred to as \"galti\" and not 'balatkaar'. The galti could be anything. For all we know, the galti in their heads could just be that there was sexual contact between two unmarried people. If we think about it, which part of their lives would've required them to consider a woman's consent? They get their marriage arranged and then they knock up their wives. If you ask them if they'd taken their wives consent to do so, you know what the answer would be. Our culture, especially in rural india, has so thoroughly stripped women of their agency. They dont have any say in their sexual/reproductive lives. I acknowledged that in my comment But that doesn't mean you will generalise like that guy did to whom I replied, all Indians ie around 800 million men aren't rapists Well I said about the exposure to the small kids....I have seen many 5 years old boys watching reels of girls (sort of soft porn) without any accessibility problem. Both from 2 different communities. .. no wonder not mentioned.. And how a 11 yo can be mature? The Shinji pfp is strangely relevant here üíÄ Lmaooooo What do you think caused that murder the method of their meeting or the twisted thoughts of the person who killed? And my point wasn't that internet cannot be a cause of this incident, but it is very annoying how people offload the main problems onto something bigger which cannot be fixed ie. INTERNET Exactly! Rape the parents! ‚Ä¶.. er I mean blame the parents This country seriously needs to provide children with age-appropriate sex education and consent otherwise they'll keep learning things from all the wrong sources and will either commit crimes like these or become victims themselves, or both. I doubt that will ever happen though, given our own ministers oppose introducing sex education in the curriculum, for they think \"it will corrupt the youth\". As if the absence of it hasn't made people awful. No one said they were I'll be honest... I was horny and attracted to girls a lot when I was this guy's age. But wtf is this A quick look at your profile, and honestly I can't say im surpriseded at all you commented this. This boy learned this from an elderly person and they need to find that person and make him pay for this. A kid can‚Äôt do this on his own. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs so clear 11?? That's a valid question. No idea about that sadly. Hope somebody answers it!! Ye kaisa title hai. He is also a minor only. The title makes it sound like they want you to treat him like an adult and he just isn't. Its messed up on so many levels and I feel for the boy too. Its some psychopathy or he is even in some really really shitty environment. .. Oh.. Its.UP..... He's a kid Internet is very cheap in india if you dont give your child ipad or phones they access those materials from someone else phone's like friends and relatives kid's. You need to teach your children about good touch bad touch, discuss about porn rape all those topics with your family member amoung your child. Cut off internet is not only solution. Listen. As a girl, I can say this... creating gender wars is stupid as f*ck Bro 11 years üòï childhood is ruined due to modernism and what the fk is this going on üòñ (It's literally India ) No one said that do anyone Hypocrisy at its peak brother When someone catches you lackin you just pull out an uno reverse Correction : * against any person. Global warming too! Definitely po*n I don't know why no one sees it, there is something much shadier at work, for a 11 year old boy to behave so. It can't be any soft porn or video. Something about it is extremely off, probably socialization. Huh? I remember mine working at much younger age than that. But I didn't know there was another function to it than urinating much much later. I think instagram is much better compared to Reddit. They do have better ban policy plus you can‚Äôt directly search for porn on insta which is not the case. Country is going wherever because of the adults in it. Not kids. The adults around those kids. You faces SA and SAed another child? Soft porn(insta, shorts and so on ) What exactly as we common man can do? I can't stop all individuals. Only thing in our hand is teach children to respect. Which i believe I'm parents did well to me and my sibling. And I might do to in future if I have any kids. But that the most a common person do. Most rapes that happens are due to growing in poverty. Majority of India is poor and it would take another few decades before they can be considered as middle class. Ah yes the perfect solution to a problem, create more problems Man this is so terrifying.. please don‚Äôt give mobile‚Äôs and tablets to kids.. may god heal the poor little girl I doubt this man like how an 11 yr opd boy even attain puberty that early You can put your point without being a condescending cunt. Kids these days are undergoing early puberty lol, it's not surprising to see a horny child. How the fuck 11 year old boy knows about sex? WTF there parents are doing? Heart wrenching I feel disgusted.. I can‚Äôt comprehend such news For those that know more, is India just generally unsave for young women or is it always specific bad regions where these things happen? He is 11 . That is so Terrifying. How does the law the works now? Anyone knows? Instead we have the education system increasing Hindu representation in textbooks. Kinda shows where India lies concerning healthy psychology. Early access to phones and social media, kids have earlier puberties these days, and bad parents. No it's usually doesn't have that much difference. 2 years is maximum they change. You know, hate can't fix anyone or anything. I'm not a big fan of \"masculine\" people and behaviour either, but I'm also not radicalizing or hating. It's easy to fall into an us-vs-them mindset. Rape is a violent crime against anyone who doesn't give consent. Male, Female, Trans etc anyone... Fix your perspective. Sex Ed might help. COCSA or Child on Child Sexual Abuse is not because of porn guys. Please do your research. It'll spread misinformation in a country which already lacks sex education and trauma responses. The child was 1000% abused himself too by an adult. Porn usage has no direct correlation to perversion. Porn only has a correlation with emotional distraught, basically, people who consume pornographic substance cope with pornography for their emotional needs including pain, sadness, LONELINESS and boredom. Please stop spreading misinformation about how watching porn leads to predatory demeanor of sexual assault. It‚Äôs also a change in society/culture. Previously people wouldn‚Äôt be so comfortable reveling in that bullshit knowing they‚Äôd be shunned by the majority. Bro. Chill. Google Child on Child Sexual Abuse. Wtf Fair enough. Sadly we are busy fighting about which party and religion and forgetting the basic human etiquettes. And I don‚Äôt think any political party can do anything. And this is actually such a hard problem to solve. Can‚Äôt take strict actions coz our justice system is based on not guilty until proven and with few anomalies of fake rape cases; actually culprits are using those cases to escape. These women who have filed fake rape cases are equally culprit who have messed up justice for victims. As a guy I feel infuriated that about the men who stoop so low but also these women who are misuing the system just out of spite. There is something so wrong with the world, and with our men and boys. It needs to be studied instead of ignored by the men in power. Good luck blaming this on women when it was a fucking 6 year old little baby girl. Financially weaker families need governmental support for such education. It needs to be prioritised by the education system. Thanks for your insight, but I was not referring to your porn when I mentioned about videos I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a radical stance to say porn is very bad. I also don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a problem for women ‚Äúradicalising‚Äù or ‚Äúhating‚Äù due to the insane amounts of female sex targeted crimes, murders, rapes, trafficking, men inflict upon them. What‚Äôs concerning are men refusing to acknowledge the (male) problems and refusing to take an active stance against all the causes. Instead, they focus on telling women to not hate or become radicalised. It‚Äôs India means there‚Äôs lots of rapes in India. That doesn‚Äôt mean every man there is a rapist, lol wtf Yeah 2 years is max nowadays but anything can happen in rural areas. I have 1.5 years and my father had 8 years. While they fought for more Hindu representation in textbooks. Shows where priorities lie. Or maybe he was a victim in the past Everybody nowadays is getting phones doesn't mean everybody will resort to this crime. It's deeper than that. Hitting early puberty isn't an answer again because that's just a phase which one has to go through.. Ok I get your point now BUT On ground reality when you find rape cases per capita it comes out to be pretty less And also I live in a tier 3 city in Maharashtra, and I have never even heard about a rape case in my whole city , these kind of problems are more potent in areas like up bihar odisha and jharkhand ( no xenophobia) Western Europe (for example the Dutch) start at age 4 with age appropriate topics. We need to do this and more - there is so much social toxicity that the schools might be the only way to fix it. No lessons from home. Parents should be publicly hanged at high noon. As a resident in a boy's hostel since 7 years old till class 12 , I think I learnt about the \"birds & bees\" earlier than most kids. When I was 11 years old, I was knew boys and girls were different but still hazy on the details. Saala what the fuck is going on nowadays, I don't think kids were biologically capable of at this. It's just so very sad. Ofc it's in india MF got erections at 11? I would have hanged him if he was my own kid üíÄ It generally happens in dehat Tuje hindu muslim ke alawa aur kuch krne aata v hai.. While I was being sarcastic, I don‚Äôt think letting 50% of the population getting repeatedly raped is working out too well either. Can you do anything other than brush problems under the rug? I studied at one of the best school in my city but there too, chapter like human reproduction in class 10th biology was skipped by our teacher. Human Reproduction is nothing close to what is required for this problem lol. Ikr, I'm just sharing that how much of a taboo sex ed is The entire world is unsafe for women lol Everyday India at this point. well technically it should! Mai to sochta tha ki couples kiss karte the, Bed pe sote the saath mai, aur uper se bhagwaan bacche pet Mai deke jaate the I know bahot childish jaisa lagega but bhai 10-11 saal ke bacche se kya hi ummed rakhoge but still ye kuch aur hi hai ;( I was abused as child and glad I didn‚Äôt harm anyone. But I played with my toys that they abuse each other. Fridge ki darwaza kholkar light check karne wale log the haam class 4 mein! India moment \"porn is bad\" is indeed not a radical statement. I was referring to other Statements and stances on your profile. And while you are correct about the crimes committed against women, saying hate and radicalization is not a problem because of that, would be in the same category of logic where racism is okay because statistically, the African American population is inclined to commit crime. And about child on child sexual abuse (also called COCSA), there has been genuine research on these things. All of them heavily pointing to factors like trauma and psychological disorders in the abuser, that is causing them to act the way they do. Not porn. I was sexually assaulted by an 11-13 year old boy when I was 7. What‚Äôs the deal with India and rape‚Ä¶ such a backwards country. >ik those insta dank comments most of time arent meant to be taken seriously I don't the above comment was a meme. Max a 14 year old boy can know is making out. He definitely came from a messed up atmosphere to pick up this shit. It's sad really. I wish the world should end soon.. I can't ... This is way to weard.ü§Æ Yeah sadly the 11 year old was probably abused to. Many kids watch porn (THEY SHOULDNT) but violence comes from another trauma. I bet porn is definitely involved somehow but some adult messed up the kid. Your point being? if he is capable to r@pe he is capable to be punished I'm sorry you had to go though that. It's not uncommon for SA victims to externalize and deal with their trauma in ways like you described. So yeah, You don't have to feel like you're alone in that. This is why hardcore pornography should be banned everywhere, or at least have some fucking actual age restrictions. This kid obviously was exposed to some fucked up shit. What the actual fuck. The parents were either entirely neglectful or abusive themselves. That's about the time i started puberty so that's not true controlled internet access but an open communication is necessary. im hoping we will prob be the first gen to have the talk with our kids and create that open space to talk all things. for now ive seen cousins do the job,ive had the talk with my cousin and even got her a vibrator and an ipill once because rather me than a stranger. thats the kind of space i want to create with my kids too,urges are common,the way you go about it decides it all 100% brotha, people are just dumb as fuck. I've written \"faced\" SA My heart is breaking for that little girl. Sorry to say but this is not a safe country to raise children. I was still playing with PlayMobil at that age. And Lego. I had no idea what sex is. >brutal punishments for abusers is needed to solve this. Well, yes, but in this case, the abuser is a minor or non-adult individual, so nothing severe should happen to him. I know the girl might be tromarized by his actions, but even if he is an adult, punishing him will not remove her pain what I mean there is also a problem in allowing that to happen in the first place better not happening than any punishment protect yourself and your loved one Some people are just born psychopaths, it's not always the fault of parents. That it most likely is not the boy's fault, maybe he has suffered the same thing before And that you're an ignorant pos who can't google a given sentence How are people blaming porn? Isn't it much more common for this type of behavior to stem from the agressor also being sexually abused by someone? Can bet that he had a phone and all those Instagram dank memers and reddit assholes got to his head. There's heaps of misogyny + free corn + disgusting comments on the corn videos - on Indian social platforms available for free. Assholes sharing women's videos without consent, making disgusting remarks. Have literally seen guys commenting on minor girls video writing 'game is game' trying to be \"sigma\". They can keep passing it as dark humour but won't take much to influence a young one to take it seriously. it‚Äôs worrying you think women hating and going radical over widespread, ingrained misogyny that‚Äôs still being denied as an issue is a problem. i also think its totally normal for women going radical over men going radical merely from women not wanting to sleep with them (incels and redpilled). all things considered, women hating and going radical seems totally natural and normal. it‚Äôs bizarre anyone thinks otherwise. the trend of sexual abusers becoming younger and younger does correlate to males being exposed to porn at a younger age. and to even more and more violent porn too. internet was cheap even 10 yrs ago. ur comment is baseless. the boy was definately abused in the past and is repeating it upon someone else >Yeah anyone capable of rape needs to be castrated becuase we have that punishment for dogs so they don‚Äôt act aggressive, same principle should be for humans, humans who act the most aggressive should be castrated. Humans are not dogs However, I believe in some of the rape cases, the punishment should be death One of the main differences between abult and non-adult is that adults take full responsibility for their actions where children don't. >it‚Äôs better to just Castrate him at this age instead of letting him grow up into a monster This has to be the dumbest take I have heard today. This comment is an example of the difference between those who are suited to lead and those who are not Laws are not enforced to take revenge for the oppressed side, but to bring justice. It is not about your anger or sadness, it is about what is right and wrong. It‚Äôs likely partially true. I doubt the offender is 11 years old, though. He‚Äôs probably closer to 14-15. Easy to lie about your age and can sometimes be difficult to verify with shoddy paperwork in some regions. He and his parents are likely gambling on leniency if authorities believe he is 11 rather than 14, you know? Everyone just STOP. Law is not a solution to such kind of Rapes . 11 year old doesn't even know about law i bet and neither it can apply to 11 year old. Only thing that can be done is have Moral CLASSES from beginning like grade 2 or something. In those classes we have to teach kids that unless your partner is in concent sex is bad thing and we have to stop sexual repression too . These 2 are only solution. Law can only act AFTER rape is committed but solution is to prevent it. Most of this happens in india. Please dont pray for the destruction of the rest of the normal world What is to you ‚Äújustice‚Äù for the four year old girl in the ICU then? Just shrug our shoulder and say ‚Äúaw but he‚Äôs a kid?‚Äù. When you sexually force yourself on someone and send them to the hospital you lose the right to call yourself a ‚Äúchild‚Äù. Dang India. Yeah an indian parent Execute him right away. In India they start early, what a shit country Something needs to be done about people who make [dank reels like these](https://np.reddit.com/r/ezReactz/s/5h0MXpOsL6) Ye tu public me bolega toh vivad ho jayega He probably had someone sexually abuse him in his past, hence his acting this way >but I‚Äôm a child‚Äù card. He is a child (this determinedbe the law), and i am not saying they shouldn't take action against him, but I say he shouldn't be treated like an adult, he him self need a mental health care his action weren't normal for his age and after what he has done the pressure or attacked from none sense adults might make him be a worse person than whatever he is already is (in the eye of some people). >What is to you ‚Äújustice‚Äù for the four year old girl in the ICU then? To bring the oppressor side to the court and take the legal action against him if guilty, also provide her with medical needs after this event But there is also a justice for the oppressors not because they are guilty mean they deserve a severe punishment The punishment should reflect the opproser state, action, and motives. Also, sometimes it is not 100% the oppressors fault, or they are not really the oppressors. All depends on the laws and regulations. Not sure if that‚Äôs true. Even if it is, then the parents are responsible for getting them the help they need. I've definitely seen younger children around me get into more relationships and all that other stuff than when I was their age. And i just turned legal, the generations below us are doing so much shit and i don't even know what we can do to resolve this. The only thing we can do to stop this downfall is first of all limit screen usage because all kind of stuff is available without any kind of barrier to anyone. I've talked to some children around that age and what I've observed is mind boggling. As for this case, i don't even know what to say. People will now be scared to even send their own children with neighbouring children and such. The innocence is disappearing, we need to adapt to the times and provide education on matters of personal touch and other such things much more clearly, early and properly, only then will we be able to reduce these cases. I have no words to describe this. It's easy enough to tell the difference between a 11 year old and a 16 year old. 11 years old??? Can we blame him?? Or is it all fault of the society? I haven‚Äôt read the article, but this is just so fucked man. Because that makes it any better. Definitely people around him women are predators too? and just like women, not all men have predatory traits. did you fail at biology or it's a cheap trick to create chaos? Where did I say he should be tried as an adult? I‚Äôm saying he shouldn‚Äôt be forgiven because he‚Äôs a child. What he did was not childlike. He forced himself on a four year old‚Ä¶ of course what he did was not normal‚Äî hence why actually facing repercussions are actually important. Because guess what happens if he walks away scott free‚Äî he‚Äôll do it again to some other kid. Not in the eye of ‚Äúsome people‚Äù, anyone who is normal can understand what he did was bad. There‚Äôs no if and‚Äôs or but‚Äôs here. If you can‚Äôt agree to this then there‚Äôs no point discussing this further. Unless there is a clear coercion (and from what we know so far there wasn‚Äôt), I don‚Äôt get your last paragraph‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the rapists fault he raped‚Äù take. Raping is 100% the rapist‚Äôs fault. Yes, maybe it‚Äôs learned behavior but we don‚Äôt know that so basing legal recourse on what could have been also doesn‚Äôt seem very just. How does 11 yr old have a sex drive and feel the need to rape. A 6yo. I hope this is just rage bait I've seen 1-2 years of difference. At Max 4 years in villages but doing 10th at age of 21 is such an extreme example. Being an extreme case of dumbass won't help, since even a child knows generalising a whole group of people based on a behavioral pattern seen in a few is not only dumb but insanely criminal And especially in this instance, where no where has it said the boy was a Muslim either. You're just trying to justify your phobia through someone else's ill fortunes which makes you look like an asshole to be honest Ok buddy, men are just 49% of the population but commit 99% of sexual crimes so men being sexual predators is obviously more common. Also it's a 11 year old which means that his predatory nature wasn't learnt from outside sources since they aren't really old enough to learn behaviour, it was just inherent to his gender. I am just saying we should not trust men since they are more like to sexually assult us. Driving a car is not the same as crashing into someone, but driver's lessons still exist. It can, but it depends on how far along in puberty they are. 11 years old is on the younger side, but not impossible by any means. Puberty has been hitting us earlier and earlier. I don't recall everything but I think I recall hearing that girls are hitting puberty around age 9 currently, though some obviously are a bit older or younger... I think for boys it was 10 or 11, but I don't recall those numbers... Wouldn't suprised me if it changed since I last encountered those numbers either. For me, I hit puberty around 10, give or take a year or so. Reason 1755574574 why I don‚Äôt want to have kids I hate to sound uninformed or prejudiced, but what the fuck is going on in India? It seems like there's a *lot* of disturbing rape stories emerging from there lately. Can you please explain how going radical and hating half of the worlds population is not problematic? To me it seems like it would Merely radicalize men more, which would radicalize women more, etc. Also, I looked up about porn being the cause behind COCSA. While I am finding things stating a correlation (so yes you were right about that, my apologies), I'm not finding anything about it being the leading cause. Just that it is another factor contributing to COCSA. >**Edit: Alright, if you want to discuss this further somewhere else, im all ears.

Not sure if it's the same way but insta used to show straight up sex videos (with genitals out of frame) and shit. I used to follow some meme pages that posted funny content when I was a teenager, but the past few times I got on it was just straight porn and OF ads posted on most of those pages. Reddit won't throw porn in your face within meme subreddits. Shitty takes, sure. But not porn for the most part. You gotta specifically look for porn to find porn. Maybe we should blame cheap internet availability with tons of ways to access free porn or even soft porn showed in the television. kisi ne uss 11yo k uppar SA kiya hoga aur uss bachhe ne usse chhote k uppar wahi krdia.. aisa bhi scene ho sakta hai.., kyunki aise hi koi bachha aise harkat nahi krega,normally i mean. Otherwise agar jiss mahol mey vo bada hua hai,wahan aise hi sab normalise hai toh, wahi sikhega na... Still its getting disturbing by the day..,the news we hear about such topics Cheers! :) you're awesome India, rape capital of the world‚Ä¶ female children aren't even safe around male children. this country is a gone case yall sure do love raping people over there huh? jesus india Wtf is going on in India folks? That raising a child is not just the parent's responsibility anymore, it's also the society's. Which is why, we as a society try to improve young lives by encouraging education and establishing schools, by not trying them as adults when crimes occur etc. Now imagine in a society, where working 8-10 hour jobs by both the parents (assuming they aren't divorced) has become mandatory to ensure food, shelter and financial safety, their kid gets molested by a neighbour after school hours or gets sexually assaulted by the school watchman before he gets on the bus. Can parents control this anymore? Can parents be around their child the whole time? Can they knowingly stop abuse when they can't even see it? Children learn from mirroring. You should look into it before making false theories. I think your comment is exactly what‚Äôs wrong with society, people are capable of rape regardless of age, to comitt such an act you have to be fully developed and matured and aware of what you are doing. This isn‚Äôt a case of ‚Äúaccidental murder‚Äù it‚Äôs a calculated move the person was well aware of doing. Rapists deserve to be castrated because they were not able to control their desires and animalistic tendencies, regardless of age, people hit puberty and sexual maturity at different ages and in the modern generation are actually hitting it much earlier than future generations. Take your liberal takes elsewhere, a victim‚Äôs justice is more improtant than trying to solve a rapists issue Right, I agree it‚Äôs society‚Äôs responsibility but it is also the primary requirement of being a parent. There‚Äôs no point in birthing a child if you can‚Äôt take care of them. Also what theory? I‚Äôm just stating my opinion and as are you. At 11 years its pretty unbelievable. There have been cases in the past where adult put the blame on the child hoping they would get lesser sentence. Mera desh mahaan If that was my son? YOURE FUCKING DEAD TO ME, I know that sounds harsh but I'm not raising no damn rapist drug dealer or felon I would but be God Vengeance.. FOOTS IN ASSES ü¶∂üèΩ India Kids nowadays are getting puberty early. Due to the lifestyle and chemicals. And exposure of course. This report is an example of why the usual flippant arguments of ‚Äúsexual frustration in India‚Äù don‚Äôt hold. And why rape is about misogyny, control of women, and power. It is the most extreme end of everyday humiliation, discrimination, dehumanisation that women undergo from literally birth to death. The men of India really appear as a complete moral failure to the outside world. Dude i did not even know what the fuck porn was until I was 16. Like i learned what porn was from a friend who told me about Mia Khalifa. Like wtf is this. At 11? Sex education is about why we have sex , why shouldn't we have unnecessary sex. It's not gonna teach you consent or shit , its personal. Most biology books about reproduction don't even go in detail about sex. They only explain the process of formation of gametes , fertilization and implantation and pregnancy. And then reproductive health is only about usage of barriers to prevent diseases and in depth analysis of infertility etc. they will not teach kids about how to have sex and all. You can't blame sex education for this. The parents should work up the courage and talk to the kids about porn. 1. Try the 11 year old as an adult: old enough to rape is old enough to be tried as an adult. 2. If the result is that this 11 yo himself is a victim of sexual abuse, try that perpetrator. 3. What kind of tuition does a 4 year old need??? It‚Äôs much more likely he is being abused himself of course you dont when it doesnt fit your agenda. Huhhhhh Learned it from the culture around him. I didn't even know what my wee wee did at 11. What the fuck is going on. Man India is such a shithole, no wonder there are so many of them escaping to Canada Learn how sexual assault propagates in a population before you say more stupid shit U.p . Says everything Japan does NOT have the lowest rate of sexual violence lmao. where did you even get that info from? The fact that he knows how to be intimate at 11 is disturbing as hell. I understand technology brings the whole world to us but I really want to know what his parents has to say about this That's why my comment's first sentence started with qualifying what would be needed from the sex education in order for it to help. Also, sex education in many countries does emphasize the need for consent and how to request it properly. I learned about it in the US in the late 90s & early 2000s and the US is hardly the most thorough about this topic. India needs to teach this kind of sex education to children so they grow up into adults with more healthy views about sex and consent. I'm not blaming sex education; I'm blaming the limitations on its reach. \"Comprehensive\" sexual education would have either been too early in his development, or too late to stop this abuse. It's also a trojan horse for some of the most obscenely pornographic and perverted education material going to curriculums of children far too young to see it. There's nothing to keep this from happening besides preventing children from seeing or hearing of this kind of behavior so they don't replicate it, which means parenting. Shocker, I know you don't want that! Social media. I didn‚Äôt even know my body was capable of ejaculation let alone having a wank. Rape? At 11? How does he even know that sex exists? Social media is a killer. they start working around 3rd grade‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm aware. how is she in critical condition from rape? I‚Äôm an American, ignorant of many things about India. But, why do so many brutal sexual assaults seem to happen there? Clearly not, because it aint got shit to do with porn Please consider reading about how porn poisons the minds and bodies of nearly everyone in society (Be it first or second hand) by viewing the subreddit I linked. I‚Äôm sure you have a personal reason to be so defensive in this way and I‚Äôm sorry for that. Wish you well. Castration No the boy has probably been abused too is that literally all you make out of their comment? Lol yeah i know your perspective. Its not hard to comprehend. Human behavioral development is, however, very complex. This is clearly a case of a child being a victim of sexual assault and then acting out that same behavior on peers. Stop propagating nonsense and actually learn how humans work Yes it does you FUCKING IDOT. Sex ed is not just about condoms and protection, its also about consent, good touch, bad touch, recognising predatory behavior, and so on. Grow the fuck up or instead of that, because sex education also needs a certain amount of emotional and mental development for a child to be able to handle it, restricting kids internet usage Especially insta (it's absolutely crazy how people of all ages sexualise even a video a 5 year old getting a hair cut) and porn, and if the kid watches shows/anime/cartoons parents should also be aware of what they watch instead of giving free access to illegal sites. Just like our parents had control what we watched while on TV. There's actually so much more harm to giving someone under 15 an free internet access than there is benefit. Why not just be strict about it. nuh-uh, I remember reading a small column in the newspaper back in 2018-19 of a 12 year old boy r\\*ping a fucking 2 year old neighbour's baby. First time I read that 'the police was shocked' to find this out upon investigation. Abe negative IQ animal, Sex education and BIO are two separate subjects. Sex ed is not about how or why we have sex, its about broader awareness around sex, protection, consent and so on. I had a problem with him calling him satan. Satan isn‚Äôt real yk‚Ä¶ Bro I'm 20 and I still sometimes watch cartoons üò≠üôè India is a ______ _____. Insert negative words here That 11 year old got very likely raped himself and is reenacting it. Kids at that age usually don't know much about sex and all that stuff if someone didn't show them. It's highly likely that he got abused himself. This isn't about education (alone), it's more about lack of protection from abusive family members Porn did this. Sex ed is the need of the hour It‚Äôs a patriarchal feature not a bug. I wish more people understood this Most likely happened to him I don't know about that, but there was an article in the Indian express back in 2018-19 about a 2 year old baby who got r\\*ped. The police was shocked to find that it was the 12 year old neighbour who did it. He confessed that his uncle used to show him porn ever since he was 9 and over the years he became curious. There can certainly be deeper issues, such as trauma. But as this is a child. No matter what stuff you watch, at under 14 you're still a child who will depend on what his adults socialise him to think. It's a well known fact that children are curious and some can have very impulsive personalities. They may or may not have an in-built system for what is wrong and what is right but even then it is weak, especially when their sense or moral is put against an elder they trust and admire. A normal, non-anti-social kid who watches porn at 9 may do nothing because he does it secretly and in his environment there's strong danger of punishment if he is caught. There is no encouragement. There is fear. But if the same 9 year old has an adult who treats it as a fun little thing even if secretive, the scenario significantly changes. The child gets validation and support. His role model (I mean the psychological term not sarcastically) has presented something in a good light. Watching porn is the way the adult is spending happy time with him. Probably the uncle also talks about r\\*pe or sexual assault as if it were a light-hearted or fun/funny thing. All sorts of factors including personality can add up. I'm not blaming porn, I'm saying cheap porn access might not be the direct cause of it but it is something that needs to be regulated because it is certainly not being used responsibly. We can teach consent, control the child's internet access, but we cannot control adults like this whom I don't even have the words to describe. Especially, kids born in poverty-stricken sections of society tend to be more vulnerable to such influence. We cannot curb poverty quickly and I'm not saying poor people should not be watching porn. But if regulating cheap internet is a quick fix to protecting freaking toddlers and babies then we should consider it more seriously. How the duck does an 11 yo kid even do that?! Hey, uhhh what the fuck?! Aaj kal kay lauday certainly agree with the last point. People are either against porn or think being vulgar all the time is a personality trait. With internet this cheap and porn getting easy access to all walks of life, there is a very strong need that sex education doesn't just teach about consent, but also how to approach porn in an appropriate manner. As long as society considers this stuff taboo we can't handle it. Porn may be repulsive in many people's eyes but the truth is that people are watching it anyway and we are facing the consequences of what happens when something as turbulent is left to spiral out of control and responsibility. And no, taking an anti-porn approach won't be of any help today, curious teens are going to find ways to do it anyway, if anything it would only add to the thrill of it. This is why schools should be having sex-ed education by people trained for it and they should actually talk to teens about porn covering all the aspects of it. Imagine if the boy was a muslim buddy psychopathy isn't something so easy to identify. Psychopaths are very clever, charming and manipulative. I'm not saying the convicted is a psychopath, what caused him is for the psychologists to decide. He could have been a victim of abuse himself, or he could have an adult encouraging him to do such things as was found out in one delhi case. Too bad he's not a pastor Wtf man üíÄ So, what is class 4? I know of the caste system, but don't know what side the boy falls into. I think many of indias problems arise from one part of their population thinking they are superior to another part for no reason other than what family they were born into. Once you start looking at other people as less than, it can make the ruling class think the lower class is less than human and deserving of whatever they want to do to them. It's absolutely crazy that this is still a thing. Possibly got introduced to porn by an elder brother or something You might not believe but all big countries have this problem. And even US is there in that list. Not defending the country and I as a male am sad that I can‚Äôt do anything; all I can do is be as vigilant as possible when I go out with my female friends ensuring they reach home safe. Unfortunately it‚Äôs a patriarchal society problem that idk how can be solved. Source : I think it should start with doing away with the caste system What the fuck are you spewing? You‚Äôre saying that everyone should just \"protect themselves\" whatever you mean by that, but if anything still happens then it‚Äôs just an oopsie and the perpetrator should not be punished ? This is not about \"removing her pain\", although it can help a lot, this is about justice and making damn sure he doesn‚Äôt do it again. Adult or not doesn‚Äôt matter. Also, what the fuck do you even mean by \"allowing this to happen\", no one allowed this, except for the monster who committed the crime. He must be trailed same as the adults‚Ä¶. Death sentence or something even worse than death Not same as far as I know, Puberty stars hitting at around 13 for most very disturbing at very tender age. Yeah I would investigate the kid's family something bad is going on in that house. That‚Äôs not true in the modern day, almost all 14 year olds know what sex is What are you talking about? many boys get puberty at 11, it‚Äôs pretty common That boy might haven been sexually assualted too by adults at a young age, otherwise its not normal behaviour for 11 year old boy. Just yesterday i was watching a video of pedophile victim survivor and she along with her sister and brother were raped at a young age like less then 5 years old. India has a lower rape rate than many nations around the world, your comment contributed nothing to this conversation Sex education does help. It includes learning about consent, controlling urges and learning about sex. apke pass uss time pure din phone nhi rheta tha na,vo bhi internet ke sath The fact an 11 year old seriously harmed a younger child by raping them is horrifying. Kids can learn how to be sadistic from their environment. They can be born evil but a lot that gets encouraged by an adult enabling them or abusing them, or both. Castrate him. If you defend this, you support a rapist regardless of age guess I'll kms Stop speaking about japan from anime lol people are fucking pervs there and its a darker society than India for example schoolgirls are forced into entertainment for lonely men . in villages they still have a large age gap from real. my mother teaches in a village school and they often ask her to enrol their 8-10 yr old kids as 3-4. and in this case, 1-2 yr age gap can make a big difference. the mental and physical development of an 11 yr old and a 13 old are vastly different. iirc, it is true that psychopaths are born that way. and since it isn't easy to detect, most grow up without getting any help. for this boy (in fact all such crimes imo), we should try to understand what caused the culprit/criminal to commit it. we can possibly learn where it came from and do something about it. It's sick and disturbing but seriously a 12 year old knows about the sex and a 6 year old going tuitions were the hell we are heading as a nation what we are turning our upcoming generation into its a high time we should leave social media and focus on our nation yeah, hypersexuality in kids is usually a sign of sexual abuse. God you are so fucking slow in the head. Go read up and learn to understand what I meant. ghor kali yuga Being a victim of porn at a very early stage in life from either family members or the well known internet is most probably regressing their brain. Because let's face the fact this used to be common in old days like real old days. Specially men i think but that might just be my bias from media. Since sexual abuse from female towards male doesn't exist in India (sarcasm). So the kid returned to monkey. As in literally not figuratively. Why porn, have you seen the crass bollywood item songs that get shamelessly played during any event. Or Bollywood item songs being played by adults on any events >You‚Äôre saying that everyone should just \"protect themselves\" whatever you mean by that, but if anything still happens then it‚Äôs just an oopsie and the perpetrator should not be punished ? Clearly, I did not mean that What I was saying bad things better not happen , I mean I will do whatever it takes to not be harm regardless of the punishment the oppressor will face I mean there is no punishment will make me better than before the harmful event The criminal must be punished, but what has been lost will never return For you and other people, it has ended, but for the victims and their relative suffering has just started, and I am sure they are ready to do whatever it takes for that horrible event to not happen rather be happy about the punishment Also, don't generalize what I have said regarding the punishment for a minor and by the way minors don't treated as adults in all countries, including India, no matter what the punishment is it will consider that fact that the oppressor is a 11 years old child. >Edit: of course you‚Äôre an arab/muslim man, I see why you would try and justify any of this now. Explain? Why ? I don't know if those people (mentioned in the post) who probably follow the same religion are Hindu or Muslim, and I don't care Note : I actually thought the post was posted on one of the many subs that I followed, but after writing my comments, I noticed that the post has been randomly promoted to me I am not subscribed to this sub. First of all. Shut the fuck up. You don't know what you are talking. The entire lesson \"Reproductive health\" is Sex Ed. Sex education Will not and will never talk about fucking consent. It will only spread awareness about protection and sex and STDs. And for that \"bio and sex education different\" so are you dumb? Entire reproduction chapter is sex education. Try googling what's sex education. It's education about sexual anatomy , sexual activity , sexual reproduction, safe sex , biry control , sexual health , responsibilities etc. Before coming here commenting not knowing the relation between Bio and sex education. Don't even talk. Who tf are you calling a negative iq animal. Check your IQ first. Probably non existent. That guy is right tbh. Look at countries who gave sex education. It didn't solve problem, we need sex Ed. But will it reduce crimes? No. Rape is a much broader than Sex Ed isn't even linked with it. Because most of these people know what they are doing, they know it's wrong. This was a child, even tho he must have heard cries and stuff. The issue is, he doesn't \"care\". You're point is not wrong. But including it in India will cause many backlash. Adding the \"reproductive health\" lesson for class 12 caused so much backlash. The lesson doesn't even talk about sex. It just talks about the STDs and Birth control and Artificial pregnancy and people hated it. Adding consent , sexual preference and all will ruin their image as parents here are very seclusive. That's why I said parents should teach the kids since they don't want the school to teach it. Indians can't stop taking L's grooming by adult certainly induces it earlier. There's abused girls who had delivered babies as low age as 7 when their systems shouldn't have worked either. Exactly, people probably gonna hate you for that but the issues isn't even about lack of sex. Even married man, and these junkyards who somehow got a girl do stuff like this. Not just men, even some women now a days. These people should search the rap*sts being questioned in Prison. Their replies really teach us that sex Ed wouldn't have helped with rape. They know about consent, they know they hurt victim, they hear cries and begging, but they just go on. Only if you can read Officers said adequate police force has been deployed in the village following the incident in a bid to prevent further trouble as the accused and the victim belong to different communities in the village. Bio doesn't tell you \"how\" we have sex. It gives a description that's it. And sex Ed do explain why and how, harmones and attraction. I already knew this was coming. People make soft porn reels and watches it normally. Children are getting ruined. This is just starting Are you bloody thick? I don't care what sex Ed means to you in India. I am talking about what sex ed means globally. And that's why people ask for bringing sex Ed up to date with international standards. \"Reproduction and sex Ed are same\". Jeez is this what literacy is now a days... Comprehensive sex education refers to K-12 programs that cover a broad range of topics related to: Human development, including puberty, anatomy, sexual orientation, and gender identity Relationships, including self, family, friendships, romantic relationships, and health care providers Personal skills, including communication, boundary setting, negotiation, and decision-making Sexual behavior, including the full spectrum of ways people choose to be, or not be, sexual beings Sexual health, including sexually transmitted infections, birth control, pregnancy, and abortion Society and culture, including media literacy, shame and stigma, and how power, identity, and oppression impact sexual wellness and reproductive freedom 80% of what you said is in class 12 Bio book in India. If you're not Indian then don't comment. If you want to introduce sex education in India as per global things then learn about the problems it caused among political parties and parents of students. Don't say \"I'm not talking about India\" in a r/india Should be investigated properly. Could be someone else and a trap to that little wei kinda doubt that , dark humor has been a thing long before social media and stuff cant really control what people say on the internet unfortunately i highly doubt sex ed is gonna help here i did read and I still fail to see where \"muslims\" where mentioned See this is irony Indian media they can't even write muslim in articles they have to go with vishesh samuday. I was looking for this comment where's the proof? But you can always control what you post, and what values you model. Children observe the world around then. Just because everyone around you isn't trying, doesn't mean it's okay not to. I studied in boys school.. Until 10std we don't know what is girls.. We were happy in our own world.. Just play cricket, cycle and pass the exam was our goal. How is this generation.. So weird Saaley ki nunni kaato. Then see whos crying and whos enjoying Yes , yesterday i got notification of instalive(modsbyben) but it was over. But insta recommendations otherlives were all soft-corn. Now what's the diff b/w insta and chingari Man, every fucking day such news comes out of UP, it's like UP is in a competition with itself to commit more and more heinous crime than the one committed before.... one person being kind wont really change the landscape of the internet bruv , thats just how it is Oh thank you for answer so very friendly -_- Does making such a comment under this kind of post seem funny to you ? This isn't dark humour. UP is horrendous Indeed the crime capital of India \"letting 50% of the population getting repeatedly raped\" what are you talking about? I usually try to be civil while arguing but this claim is outrageously stupid. What most Indian parents don't realise is, if you don't educate your child on sex, consent and protection, they will likely learn it from distorted sources (friends, porn) which is usually inadequate and harmful. I was busy in maths counting Rohit bought 12 üçå like this question in maths .and doremon,chotta Bheem etc .in class 4 ... Kya se kya ho gya avv I think the boy is victim of psychological porn addiction. Govt. must take some action as it is destroying the small children minds. In india where data is very cheap and online games make it even worse. Children dont know who they are talking to. What that person feeding them with knowledge. I remember my first time exposure to this thing was when i was in school class 7 or 8 my friend has Oxford dictionary in it underline words he use to show. And then go to seniors who tell us about those things. This news is creepy and give goosebump when i read it. Thinking about girl felt in that little age. That shouldn't matter, you do what you can with what you have. Being a good person in general doesn't change anything. That doesn't invalidate it. Huge population that is not well to do im not saying it invalidates it , im just saying telling everyone to be a good person is not a plan its a wish , a wish that i really dont see coming true Being kind isn't some political theory that needs advocacy and strategy. It's a simple matter of caring, and holding yourself and others responsible for what they do in this real world with real consequences. Often it's as simple as being unkind, to the unkind and irresponsible that causes a fundamental change. But yeah, some other people are terrible so there's no point in trying to not be. Nihilism in general is an ugly trait that only services to breed more, and deeper nihilism. this isnt fantasy land , if the only thing society needed to change was people being kind we would be living in a utopia rn changing something as vast as the internet is simply not possible by just being kind the only ways to deal with it would be censorship (which is super lame) or the better alternative : getting off the internet how is whatever we are discussing about at all related to nihilism ? One of the lowest not the lowest comparatively Japan has a far lower rate of sexual assault compared to Botswana where porn is illegal Countries which have restricted porn or banned it (india,China Russia) have a higher rate of sexual violence compared to those that have not , porn overall has a negative correlation with actual violence Lastly Japan does have a one of the lowest actual crime rate there is a difference between reported and actual crime rate Rape pertinent charges should be draconian in nature , this boy is a criminal and should be tried like one. I don't get it. In cases like these, the 11 year old is physically incapable of doing such things. And it is mostly an adult who has managed to divert the attention to a kid. An 11 year's old body simply doesn't have the hormones? \"Innocent until proven guilty\" is literally how justice is supposed to work. This is not an impossible issue to tackle, the fundamentals of how to tackle it is already known. Its not rocket science. It's just that Indian politics never discusses education, children's welfare, healthcare, etc. Civic awareness is just not there, and people at most only think about the economy or degrees and what not. Though usually they're thinking about caste and religion and communal nonsense. this one anecdote does not disprove the empirical fact that Japan has one of the lowest rate of sexual violence And on the whole restrictions on porn has a negative correlation with sexual violence The argument your making can be applied to most forms of media does violent media cause violence?? Or is violence related to structural issues such as poverty >schoolgirls are forced into entertainment for lonely men . What the fuck did you just write??? What's more likely is that this child was himself abused or saw someone in his family do this or similar things - or worse, his family environment is so toxic and misogynistic that he didn't even realize this is a bad thing to do. I saw sexually inappropriate behavior multiple times as a child, and I literally had kinks at like 11. Before I hit 14 I ended up being CSA'd lol You people who think porn and \"lack of oversight\" is what causes this are so sheltered LOL Dude, I'm not saying it's gonna change the entire world. It's just a starting point, and frankly it's a lot easier than what you're doing. I came in here, say it's worth being responsible for yourself and try to be a positive influence, and your response is literally just, \"it's not gonna work so don't even bother trying.\" That's a very nihilist mindset. You may as well just be saying, \"other people don't do it, so why should I?\" You know what I mean? Sex education absolutely can stop rape if you get taught about consent, bad touch, etc. What are you smoking? Everyday we reach a new low ü•¥ Impossible to fix this country. no , what i am saying is a few people being kind isnt gonna make the internet safe for all ages Honestly I don't know how biology is working these days due to the lifestyle n all but does the guy even get matured enough to have puberty , erection n all , If certainly whatever the news claims is true then I don't see any reason to pardon him or consider him to be a child n give juvenile treatment, I mean what sorta things he is watching or reading to commit something heinous at such young age , when u r supposed to eat sleep play study n fuck it all just enjoy but not in this manner N now that I think of it I don't mind Yogi showing his bulldoZer justice in this matter As an insider, India has a mix of both denial and awareness. That's why you see these posts - people are aware and horrified. India does have a unique issue: we're the only country with 1 billion people and poverty on the level we have. The next country with a billion people is behind a firewall and linguistic and other barriers. India has 40% of the world's domestic violence related suicides iirc. Find me another country with a material situation like India's, you can't. That's the actual problem: poverty, bad material conditions, and bad government. I agree we tend to be in denial, but that's not unique to India. It's just patriarchy, lack of education, bad policies, massive poverty, etc. Same old shit, different place, with the population and other issues (bad infra, fuckton of noise and air pollution, hyper competetive society, status anxiety, horrible non existent mental health care systems, etc) coming together to create a huge fucking mess. If you do not teach your kids about sex, someone else will, or they teach it themselves through porn. What is the more healthy option? I got sexually curious when I was 5 after watching German TV late at night. But the stuff we have access to now 24/7 is wastly different from back then. I feel like you learn women are humans not objects by being taught young about concepts like consent - since when teaching consent you aren't just mechanistically teaching consent alone. It implicitly teaches you to learn that women are not 'Other' - not aliens you have to act upon or against to obtain your human needs (companionship, status, self-esteem, etc) and that they're humans just like you, imo. With the situation in India with women's bodies, I feel like yes teaching about consent is very important, as is teaching about how SA as an experience works. You need to give kids a fighting chance against being groomed into the cult of patriarchy and misogyny. We need to cut out the othering and the separating of a woman's body and her personhood as early as possible. Also uh honestly when I was a kid, because I'm a boy, a lot of adults touched me in ways that I felt were sexual/made me feel ashamed. I just didn't have words for it. It was an era where family friends could literally bathe you if they wanted.. not fun, because adults here don't respect kids and can be arrogant towards them. Saying no was often not tolerated. I suspect that contributes to SA, too, how can you intuitively grasp bodily integrity and empathy if you have yours violated when young? And did I say I am against investigating sexual abuse? Porn and bad parenting are known issues that cause children to learn and engage in heinous acts. Even if he was abused, it's highly likely that his parents are either the abusers or simply didn't pay enough attention at him. > You people who think porn and \"lack of oversight\" is what causes this are so sheltered LOL Laughs on such serious matters and calls me \"sheltered\". I'm laughing at you because I'm an actual child sex abuse victim while you're not affected by this issue and have simplistic and conservative views on it. That's not me laughing at the issue. Porn is not known to cause children to sexually abuse children, neither is \"bad parenting\" unless you mean abuse. I agree his parents - or someone in his environment who is caring for him - are most likely abusers. I just don't think it has to do with oversight. that makes it sound like they didn't discipline him enough or something or that it was caused by internet use. It's far more likely he has seen inappropriate or abusive behavior in his environment or that he himself was abused. I apologize for being rude it's just a very frustrating and painful topic. Then what were you referring to? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0df7k\\_\\_KEHw&pp=ygUbc2Nob29sZ2lybHMgZm9yY2VkIGluIGphcGFu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0df7k__KEHw&pp=ygUbc2Nob29sZ2lybHMgZm9yY2VkIGluIGphcGFu) There is a documentry on this. This is just one incident there are many such dark and shady stuff in japan which the world dosen't know. Give children all uncensored access to high speed Internet and then keep ranting about _ohh, how did that happen?_ Also, parents be like : _It happens one in million. My son can never ever do this. He is so pure!_ Give children all uncensored access to high speed Internet and then keep ranting about _ohh, how did that happen?_ Also, parents be like : _It happens one in million. My son can never ever do this. He is so pure!_ Fucker it means fourth grade Ok I know this will sound harsh, but why isn't the religion of the boy being brought into this? In other cases where the criminal is from a non-hindu religion, blatant use of religious affiliation is used, even when the crime has no relation to religion whatsoever. So why in cases like this, the article/story doesn't say Hindu boy rapes a Hindu girl? I'm damn sure if this was a Muslim boy-hindu girl, the outrage would be 100x more. About point 2, are you still going to try and punish the 11yr old kid? If not, why? What if he did it at the age of 23 and not 11, would you still let him go because he only did it because of past trauma? Left untreated, it can grow, so an adult is even more affected by it than a child. Some heal, many dont. And the perpetrator who abused the child in the first place could also have been abused himself. Dont look into people's backstories and feel sympathy. Before they do something, do everything to get them to heal, but after they commit a grave sin, punishment is the only way forward, child or adult. The first stage of puberty in FEMALES is completed at 11. For MALES that stage takes upto 13-14 years of age A lot of people here are blaming the easy availability of porn but not many realized that Indian parents have a habit of having sex at night right near kids. this should be deemed illegal but unfortunately not many blame this behavior. A psychiatrist told me how a kid was starting to become extremely sexual in his behavior at the age of 10. turns out he has been seeing his parents have sex and thus this was a learned behavior . taboo and exciting. In poor households and limited space, parents often have sex at night right beside the kids thinking they are asleep. Accessibility to porn is of course to blame along with sexualised reels targeted towards kids. parents not monitoring them, along with desensitization of public in general towards immodesty on online platforms. The second one, avoid some central and northern states and the others are mostly fine compared to the rest of the world. 11 is pretty common too, it starts between 11 to 13 and upto 2 years earlier for girls I think he meant cut off their dicks Comment section blaming internet inplace of parenting is the most indian shit ever. What no one here understands is that it's a hormonal issue. That's how nature has made all animal species. The kid at 11 must be having raging sex hormone in his blood and at that age he can barely understand right from wrong. Chennai High Court had suggested hormonal treatment to all men to control sexual assault. But that's a hugely unpopular opinion. How many of us would want to neutralize our sex drive because we are becoming a law and order problem for society? I don't think that's from Instagram, that's from people around him (from personal experience) It's possible Too fucked up to believe. If a victim has to live with the effects of the crime for the rest of their life, then so should the perpetrator. And if someone is raping that boy, they should also be caught. And I am suggesting that the parents should be tried for this act. This will ensure that they pay attention to their child‚Äôs development. Lol We should probably have the strict restrictions that the Chinese government has on the internet Actually they have ? It's just the we make a big fuss while they don't. And unlike us who are decent enough, girls there are willing to do these shit. Execute him Bro it's a criminal activity and not a highschool certificate. In this context, there is no reason to call someone 11 yo when he's actually 15 unless someone gave wrong info to media or media makes a mess of it The thing is our society never seen rape as violence against women most dudes can't even tell the difference between sex and rape and society will think it happened because of horniness when in truth they're just sadistic freaks who have lust for violence Bharat is mahan due to high and noble values! Although our recorded reputation doesn't guarantee it (women and children and lower castes have been....you know what I mean) we must nevertheless try! It is very embarrassing to be the rape capital of the world! Something needs to be done. Even if they do start teaching sex ed in schools, many conservative parents will start a fight against it. Many people even say that sex ed is used for boosting condom sales. In ancient India, sex was seen as something very spiritual and divine but nowadays it's considered very taboo So you are saying that fcker did what he did because of the adults around him and he didn't have the brain cells for controlling him from doing such horrific crime???? Agree. Sexual abuse cycle is toxic and it is very hard for survivors to have normal sexual behaviours if they have been through the hell of childhood sexual abuse. Exactly. Someone has harmed that boy too. I see what you are saying but it could be the child is abused by someone close to the family and the parents don‚Äôt know. Could be an adult who is entrusted with his care- teachers, religious people. Paedophiles tend to be drawn to job where they can have free access to their victims and not be seen as suspicious. Exactly. You couldn't do anything with it Hmm fair enough; and sad part is no govn gonna care about that. Indeed. yep and bcuz porn sites are banned this shit get circulated through whatapp and telegram groups easily Who cares! Just give us your votes and fight with each other in the name of religion while education, what? who needs education have you heard that anyone is cheering or getting excited for a good school no no build us a mandir bro we sure need more religious places instead of a good education system and a good health system, giving everyone the same starting line, no, vote for the new India. No no bad idea. What about specifically on porn sites Huh.. but.. ah never mind. You cannot access many porn sites. Some are somehow open due to some bug maybe. If you really care, even a little, don't skip the first link atleast. The rest are for your own knowledge about childhood sexual abuse. **Hopefully, if you have kids or ever decide to have them, you're more aware.** From RAINN - \"Many perpetrators of sexual abuse are in a position of trust or responsible for the child‚Äôs care, such as a family member, teacher, clergy member, coach, or other children such as older siblings.\" About COCSA i can‚Äôt even process this‚Ä¶ a 11yo boy, how does he know all of this he's real, i met him when i travelled to a beach in hawaii yeah especially redditü§° yeah he is not even near the age of puberty i really think he might be mentally ill we don‚Äôt know how he was brought up, like what all he saw why are we women even living in india anymore? if a 6yo kid is not safe how are we? and don‚Äôt you fuckers ever say its cause of what you wear UP, Delhi, Haryana, Bihar are c@ncer to India Ye ho kya raha hai! I think we should stop talking about and promoting BARE MINIMUM consent. We should talk about wholehearted participation. Other person should happily participate. A meek, half-hearted Yes can also be taken to be consent. Or he was also sexually assaulted by someone before. It's a learned behaviour mixed with hypersexuality caused by SA. This! Can't believe i had to scroll this far down for this. >But will it reduce crimes? No. Rape is a much broader than Sex Ed isn't even linked with it. Actually, yes it would, and does in those other countries. I live in the US so I know more about its situation and differences in sexual education between states has been linked to differences in sexual violence rates for those states. States with sex education where children are simply taught that sex is bad have higher rates of rape and sexual child abuse than states with more comprehensive sexual education programs. >The issue is, he doesn't \"care\". This is definitely the issue. The 11 year old was influenced by the adults around him to think this was okay. Now imagine if one of those adults was a teacher telling him how important consent is and if multiple adults around him were also people who grew up learning how important consent is. Do you really believe this 11 year old would have turned out the same way as he did? There'll definitely be a backlash. The same happens in every country that decides to do it because a lot of parents don't like to think of their children as beings who will eventually have sex and probably want to have sex at a younger age than the parents think it's appropriate. It's not that the parents don't want schools to teach their kids about it; it's that those parents don't want their kids to get that information because of misconceptions like \"it'll make them want to have sex\" and \"it'll corrupt the kids\". There's idiot parents in every country who think even giving their daughters the HPV vaccine will make them into sluts. This kind of mentality is why schools need to disseminate some of the important information regarding sexual health like contraceptive use and consent rather than leaving it to parents because it is important for a country's population to be on she same page about it. You said chemically castrating is not a solution. I said that was sarcasm but the sheer volume of rapes and violence against women in this country has drastically increased so clearly something has to happen. I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs confusing about it? I‚Äôm also not being uncivil, I‚Äôm asking if you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the solution (which fair, it isn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôs sarcasm) then what is? Because nothing else we‚Äôve done so far seems to be working. Jio 5g ka kamaal Make internet expensive again Or atleast dont have kids if you can't keep a tab on what they consume online [https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/India/United-States/Crime](https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/India/United-States/Crime) (multiply Indian rape crimes by 4 times due to unreported crimes existing too) I don't like when people try to fly away the roots by saying give children sex education and rapes will stop and think \"Government is too dumb to think of this\". I don't want you to offend you in anyway but what you concluded was absolutely wrong. and in worse case a very non thoughtful opinion. There was an Interview of 50 rapist by Samuel D. Smithyman's (there have been multiple interviews by different people but I am referencing this bcs its basically all the response by others too.) The biggest issue is people think rape is like \"horny man forcefully does intercourse with a girl\". but the never hold what goes in mind of rapist. The Audacity to say adults influenced to him rape is okay is insane. Did he did any vulgar behavior at home or in front of parents? Parents are usually unaware; rapists have included some bright school/college students too. Believe me, he knew consent, yes means yes, no means no. Its complicated than putting off issues on 2 or 3 things. That sounds hella xenophobic i was trying to say that, no way that every single woman in this country is repeatedly getting raped. &#x200B; >the sheer volume of rapes and violence against women in this country has drastically increased source? &#x200B; >then what is? more sex ed, awareness to reduce overall population of the country, leaving behind traditional values and beliefs, etc may help in my opinion. I think we're talking past each other because I never said rape happens because men are horny. I also said that sex education is not THE solution but one of a thousand things that need to work together to reduce the rape problem in any country. The kid was 11 years old. The adults in his life absolutely influenced how he thought this was an okay thing to do. Yup, DSM does cite this as a causation of hypersexual behaviour. It‚Äôs a tragedy from all aspect of this sad episode. The schools try their best man. But there's nothing they can do when the parents are this dumb. This generation is doomed. Insaniyat khatam hogayi hai. Well yeah the hardness of the equipment works the same but the eggs are not completely prepared if he ever had done jerking before then the feeling is mutual I guess üëÄ. What he did is because he had easy access to porno and may be he was abused by a random pedophile before.üò™ü§í The physical torture directly affects mentally. What statistic are you using to determine that out of billions of people absolutely no one has gotten repeatedly raped? That seems like a stretch. While I meant that rapes are happening repeatedly, not one person getting repeatedly raped, there‚Äôs still no way anyone can make such an absolute claim. Especially considering the fact that many rapes happen within a household and those are definitely frequent. Source‚Äî NCRB and Starista. NCRB claimed that 71% are unreported which was up from 2022. Statista had a report of countries that saw higher reported rapes vs. 2 years prior, India was on that list. That, and the fact that every other article I read is about yet another rape. While that maybe anecdotal, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stretch to conclude that the number of rapes are going down. I agree with most of your list except that the ones which are most useful aren‚Äôt actionable I.e. reduction populations leaving traditional values behind. I‚Äôd add consent, stricter punishments for rape, creating open and safe channels as well as victim protection to reduce the % of unreported crimes. I was able to cum since I was 11. Idk what to tell you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fair enough. And it's Lack of parenting and influencing in his life (in my opinion). Add Rajasthan (I say this despite of it being my native place) and Bangalore as well to it. Yeah Rajasthan with child marriage. But how come Bangalore. It's not just a hormonal issue, nor is it something which suggests that the kid can't differentiate right from wrong. If that was the case, imagine how many minor rape culprits we would have, given the fact that we are the most crowded hell hole on this planet. Very disturbing, upbringing and non parent controlled access to the internet could be causes. Parents should be held responsible too. At 11 back in my days we just spent time playing cricket. It's disturbing how kids are nowadays can't call them kids anymore.. As a matter of fact it's was when I nearly turned 12 that I got to know the basic idea. But what exactly it is took some time. Rajasthan not just for child marriage but mob lynching, men raping or kidnapping and raping or kidnapping and raping and killing women of lower caste, honor killings, and quite some more. And Bangalore as well is pretty effed up. I've had friends who were working there and they had some interesting experiences. Molestation is something that happens there as well quite frequently (definitely more frequently than it does in safe places). Unfriendly people are another reason. Then a good chunk of people who blindly go on a rampage and vandalize things based on language, caste, ethnicity, and threatening non locals. How do these kids even have erection at this age Open & free access to internet & social media caused this... How hard it is to type words into URL & watch unfiltered porn & semi porn on social media.? Most parents are tech dumb to figure out internet & kids learn quickly all this lead to is bad sex knowledge & courage to just grab a girl. Is this even possible at agr 11? Ikr why pray for destruction of the rest of the world just cause India can‚Äôt control its rampant rapist infestation You know, it somewhat has to do with how kids are brought up in here. There isnt any sex-ed or anything similar, kids just go spoilt rotten because of that \"one dirty\" fish in the pond. Guys think its \"cool\" to have sex because they never see it happening irl. All that just mixes up to make a recipe for disaster. This is one such example. Either.. we change how parenting is done as time goes on, or.. we really ought to make changes ourselves. wut? üôÑ Ok True So much for Mera bharat mahaan . And imagine this , he's being booked under a law which was meant to protect him as well from such acts . I met him you dumbass, just coz you haven't seen him doesn't mean he isn't real. Mf was claiming a tree and preparing to nosedive into a bowl on fruit punch to spill it all over the VIP guests and get the waiter in trouble. Luckily I found a priest and we threw a chappal at him, worked once but idk if that strategy would hold good for next time. Always, ALWAYS, believe in the power of the Hawaii chappal, you heathen. That was hysterical ü§£ü§£ 11? Thanks to free Internet provided by certain company Bruh how?? Does an 11 year old even have those hormones? He hasn't even started puberty. How?? How tf? I didn't know what sex was until 7th grade. This is do creepy Are we ever going to try an accused based on the severity of the crime? Juveniles seem to be getting away with a lot of sh*t. >What statistic are you using to determine that out of billions of people absolutely no one has gotten repeatedly raped? I never said that \"noone is getting repeatedly raped\". I just said that \"no way all women are repeatedly getting raped\". you seem to be twisting my words for the sake of your argument. &#x200B; >Source‚Äî NCRB and Starista. NCRB claimed that 71% are unreported which was up from 2022. Statista had a report of countries that saw higher reported rapes vs. 2 years prior, India was on that list. That, and the fact that every other article I read is about yet another rape. While that maybe anecdotal, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stretch to conclude that the number of rapes are going down. why did you provide these statistics? what statement that I had made, were you trying to counter? &#x200B; >I agree with most of your list except that the ones which are most useful aren‚Äôt always actionable Well, you're probably right. I‚Äôm not twisting any words. Your initial words, (before your edit) made it seem like you denied that there are women who are repeatedly raped. Maybe that‚Äôs not what you meant to write but that‚Äôs what I replied to. You literally commented ‚Äúsource?‚Äù. To me that generally means you want to know my sources‚Ä¶ so I provided it? Not trying to counter anything. Actually if I recon I had a Rajasthani friend who did molest a woman. Stopped talking to him removed from every social media. Bangalore in terms of rape is safe. WHAT? do you know how people have access to porn these days on the internet at younger ages? access to internet and porn >Your initial comment (before clarifying edits) made it seem like you denied that there are women who are repeatedly raped No. I just denied that 50% of the population was repeatedly getting raped. These are the exact words you'd said. \" I don‚Äôt think letting 50% of the population getting repeatedly raped is working out too well either. \" &#x200B; >You literally commented ‚Äúsource?‚Äù. To me that generally means you want to know my sources‚Ä¶ so I provided it? Not trying to counter anything. Ah, sorry. didn't realize you replied to that part of my comment. My apologies. NO, lets not support the accused again please, young kids have access to internet and easy porn these days which should make it easier for him to know he raped a kid I just cant with Indian men, look at the comment section especially on Instagram Isko koi samjhao Idk man these kind of news are actual incidents..that are happening, it breaks something inside me. Yr what causation one might draw even.. it's just dreadful. Providing internet to kids at a young age should be stopped Or atleast their parents should restrict it to only play games and study ig Usual suspects No words man, it's so fucked up 11 was the age for me when I was watching jhonny quest and toonami wtf are kids watchign these days . These are the effects of porn being everywhere on the fuckin internet. I found sexual pictures at the age of 10, from a math games website displaying ads with women in 5km radius blatantly. And again, I never said it would. But if you're not taking responsibility for yourself, you can't expect any5hing to ever get better. *Everything* starts at the indivual level. If you're gonna just, refuse to try you kind of lose your right ti complain. Like, you have to put forth some effort. Unrestricted internet access and p*rn are a dangerous combination. my issue never has been the internet , its the parents who let their children access it unsupervised i honestly dont care if the internet stops being racist/sexist/vulgar or whatever problem u have with it because its simply not possible to do as unlike in the real world there are hardly ever any consequences to what u say online do to everybody being completely anonymous if u dont want children seeing stuff they shouldn't be seeing pay attention to what they're accessing being realistic is not the same as being nihilistic I grew up with Airtel 3g pendrive thing, so yes possibly Its like atleast 60% of the country bro ur good Bollywood is the fundamental place for the gestation of this disease, which is thereafter stimulated even more by nudity propagated by so-called influencers and celebrities on social media day in & day out. Not just men and boys, rape is being perpetrated on women by fellow women on the big screen and internet. No point in ignoring it. Bollywood is the fundamental place for the gestation of this disease, which is thereafter stimulated even more by nudity propagated by so-called influencers and celebrities on social media day in & day out. Not just men and boys, rape is being perpetrated on women by fellow women on the big screen and internet. No point in ignoring it. Too much Internet, social media's, vs not enough learned emotional intelligence to determine the difference between fantasy vs reality. People need to learn how to interact with other people as our personal computer time is addictive and can be damaging. Why drag religion into this :/ Unfortunately that's what is happening in our country. This is sick and very alarming Bro, i learned about vagina in class 7. Before that, i didn't even know girls had different system. This is truly sad. If there is anything we can help with we will. Before class 7 i didn't even knew that girls had different parts. Parents are at fault, please do not give your kids mobile phones or any sort of devices which have internet in it, porn videos, even insta now a days have sexual content that degrades kids mindset, this new generation parents are the worst please be strict and maintain discipline at home please ensure that your kids knows whats wrong and what's right. India is becoming a rape hub now few months back a moto vlogger was raped and now 11 year old kid fk that.. India ain‚Äôt stopping when it comes to lead the world‚Äôs graph to top off the charts in rapes. It‚Äôs sad to know but no one knows what can stop this madness. Wait a second 11 yo should be a high-schooler (A class 7 kid or a class 6 kid) how come he's still in class 4? In POCSO it is actually on the accused to prove that they did not commit rape I have given hope on humanity fr. Like i can't believe this news. Extreme punishment will incentivise murder, as it's much harder to pinpoint the perpetrator without the victim being alive. Welcome to Digital üáÆüá≥, this sought of cases are rising from when internet became free/cost less, I am not saying thats the mistake, but people tend to take bad things easily and leave out the good in something. And small childrens getting exposed to p*rn and other sxxual things shown on YT/FB/IG videos, doesn't understand the consequences. So called inblufengers are doing the same - targeting younger people for cheap views and popularity. WHAT THE HELL???????? Are parents not parenting any more ???? Hang him It works, I watched porn when I was in class 5 , but was never addicted to it, I also had crush when I was in class 7 but thanks to corona , I actually got matured (mentally) starting from class 8 1. How can a class 4 guy get erection and sexual thoughts 2. Why the fuck class 6 girl is going to tution ALONE without parents, it's not like a girl can get raped but she can also be subject to kidnapping, accidents and extra It's not porn it's the soft porn availability in Instagram It is simply not possible, biologically this thing is not possible for an 11 year old to do. I think someone is hiding behind that kid. Thorough investigation is required in this case instead of jumping to conclusions. soo sad why don‚Äôt mothers raise their sons"
