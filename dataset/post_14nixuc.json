        ">The Madhya Pradesh high court has urged the central government to consider reducing the age of consent from 18 to 16 to avoid the “injustice” of adolescent boys being treated as criminals, an observation it made while scrapping an FIR against a 20-year-old man accused of rape\n\n>2012 amendment that increased the age of consent from 16 to 18 has “disturbed the fabric of society”, said a single-judge bench of justice Deepak Kumar Agarwal.\n\n>“***Nowadays, every male or female near the age of 14 years, due to social media awareness and easily accessible internet connectivity, is getting puberty at an early age***,” the judge said. “Boys and girls are getting attracted to each other owing to this early puberty,” he said, ultimately “resulting in consensual physical relationships.” “In these cases, male persons are not at all criminal. It is only a matter of age when they come into contact with female and develop physical relationships,” he said.\n\n>The observations came as the court quashed an FIR against the 20-year-old man, who a 16-year-old girl accused of raping her repeatedly for six months and impregnating her in April 2020.",
        ">Nowadays, every male or female near the age of 14 years, due to social media awareness and easily accessible internet connectivity, is getting puberty at an early age\n\nThese law graduates should limit their \"knowledge\" only to law.\n\nThe case is about a damned 20 year old impregnating a 16 year old girl. Milord can hypothesise occurrence of early puberty due to the internet but cannot understand how large a 4 year difference is in teenage years.",
        "Nice try pedos",
        "NO. NO. NO.",
        "No. Rather improve Sex-Ed and include the concept of consent in curriculum in school so that teenagers know what is ok and what is not.\n\nIf the boy is 20 and has no 'criminal' intent but ends up coercing the girl 4 years his junior then this is not only a wilfully illegal act on part of the boy but also a failure of the education system and the social culture that the girl didn't have the understanding, knowledge and perhaps the liberty to say no to him and complain to her parents or teachers.\n\nChildren are indeed reaching puberty early due to changes in diet and lifestyle and start behaving as adults sooner due to the avalanche of information and exposure on social media but unfortunately they are not reaching the emotional or mental maturity at the same time which leads to poor decision making. This isn't their fault, this is the fault first of the families which are still living in the past not realizing the need for change in approach to raising their kids and second the education system which still treats such interactions as taboo and just something to be avoided and hush hushed completely.",
        "If anything, they can think about bringing something like the Romeo and Juliet laws in some countries (where minors can consent, provided the age gap is within a permissible limit). That is applicable for teenagers fooling around, and not for cases where a 20 year old is impregnating a 16 year old.",
        "This is disgusting",
        "Why did we go from 16 to 18 in 2012?",
        "The Saghis seem to have an incentive to dumb down yhe age of consent amd weaken POCSO. Cases of sexual abuse of minors have been the biggest PITA for the rapist BJP goons.    \n    \nThis can also help them target young girls from minority religions with minimal repercussions and many ways to game the courts. I dread the India where grooming & rape of minors is legalized.",
