        "i mean everyone is getting fucked, do you think your job pays you what you are worth? when you apply for a job do they offer you what the role is worth or do these ask you your last salary?",

        "1000 main 3 bhk kon kr raha zara hmko bhi btao",
        "shit flows downhill, our office screws us, we screw people we pay and the government screws everyone",
        "Sorry man, that's a piss poor attitude to have. Even if I assume a modest family income of 20 lakh/year (modest for someone who can afford to have a maid and live in a 3BHK), paying the maid 1000/month to clean your house is exploitation. \n\nIf you can justify it just because you are believe you are getting exploited, then you lack empathy.",
        "My life is not going great so I must piss over others who are lower in the pecking order",
        "I dont know which city has 1000 for a 3bhk, I have lived in 4 major cities and its always 1500+ for a 2bhk with only 2 people living",
        "1500 per week? or per month?",
        "Every time I think I can't hate fellow countrymen more, they take that as a challenge.",
        "month, you pay 1500 a week?",
        "Lol. With such rates nobody is gonna show up to work.\nWho they gonna disbar?",
        "Iâ€™m assuming there are always people who are  disenfranchised and desperate enough.",
        "You will surprised to know that how many don't look below while taking a piss.",
        "don't have maid , and I never lived in Metro cities, so was just curious about the money people pay to their maids.",
        "you dont get paid enough, are going to rob a bank to pay your maid? kaise log aate hain comment karne, if the rate isnt good she can obviously  refuse to work for you they aren't slaves",
        "Anywhere between 1500-2000 for a 2bhk for a month.",
        "Whether someone can afford to pay the maid or not is upto the individual. This situation is different in that it is using an institution to artificially reduce the wages. This is done to stop people from paying more who could otherwise afford to.",
        "Our dear brothers and sisters. Lol. We canâ€™t exploit them enough",

        "minimum (livable) wage should be 25K/month India, these people have no idea how expensive basic necessities (food (vegetables, wheat, fruits), fuel, clothing, electricity, water) are nowadays.\n\nthat's how much one needs to actually sustain themselves and 2-3 other members of their family, esp when you factor in kids.\n\nand we pay that to entry-level engineers.",
        "In pune it's 1k every chore for 2 bhk.",
        "nope, Im in Pune, in a relatively cheaper area and we pay 1800 for 2bhk, we are 2 people family.",
        "Tbh the wages of domestic workers depends on the city. Considering pune rates in article is on par with what's happening atleast in my society. Only ppl who have to significantly pay more is bachelors. Ladke ladke bolke everyone milks them.",
        "Fake news",
        "True. When I was in Bangalore, the same maid that used to charge 1k to my neighbour was asking me 2k as I was a bachelor living alone. When I said 1k or Iâ€™ll do it myself they started obliging.",
        "This. With some much unemployment and people in desperate need of jobs there will always be someone to work for less, that is why we need labor laws and social security nets to prevent exploitation.\n\nSame strategy is used by corporates, just look at starting salary of WITCH companies that has remain stagnant for decades now.",

The very same women who bray about how shit men are go on to exploit and bargain down with their maids! ðŸ¤£\n\nI have seen it 1st hand in BLR and MUM where they campaign in their building kitty party group to push maids to use service lifts, enter the complex from a side gate etc.",
        "What are you smoking bro? Teachers get paid 9k.",
        "exactly my point, even engineers, a highly regarded profession, are paid 25K/month, what about other jobs then? 10K/month isn't even livable for a single person, let alone more than that. what would you even do with 10K in hand per month, that's barely enough to rent a place to live in, to pay the bills, to buy the food, to buy necessities, etc",
        "This rate card is not even applicable in tier 2 city let alone in Gurgaon. Kuch bhi",
        "I live in a multi building gated society with over 500 flats and thankfully this exploitation has not yet made it here. Hopefully it never will. \n\nInflation is anyway running faster than their monthly salary increases year after year and if we strip them of their fair right to negotiate, what are they even left with? I mean we negotiate when we move from one company to another, right? Then why not give them the same privileges,?",
        "Isn't Gurgaon a rich area comparatively in the ncr???? I toh live in not such upmarket area and pay almost double the rates they gave.\n\n1000 se zyaada toh 3bhk ki dusting ke lete hain yahan",
        "Not the first time I'm hearing of this so trust me, far from being a fake news, this one.",
        "The difference is the base salary.. You getting paid less by 30% is sad but a maid getting paid 30% less is criminal...\n\n\nThe same thing happened during covid.. Our office gave only 50% salary... A director  getting 25l instead of usual 50l can still manage his expenses but the peon getting 5000 instead of 10k will make his survival difficult\n\n\nPaying less to the people who are essential to make your house work and are economically so weak is not something you can justify by saying oh no one gets paid what they are worth",

It will take half a week for their houses to turn into dumps.Â \n\n\n\nThe scabs are doing a great disservice to themselves and also the other workers.",

Factor in the uncertainty and getting fired easily and understand that they lose 20-30% of what they'd be earning if it were a steady job.\n\nMost people make a potty face when these people ask for leaves. We salaries people can go for a week or even month of leave, but these people are so scared of losing their job to someone else that long leaves are just not for them. \n\nBe kind.",
        "25k/ per month?? Brother if you make that much you come in the top 10 percentile of salaried employees.. I agree that there should be some sort of minimum wage, but you suggest 25k as the amount shows that you don't understand that it is a pretty big amount, and essentially not possible.",
        "It's not about being kind or not kind. The thing is the rates quoted in this article are bullshit.\n\nThey are obviously underpaid but no one is getting 3 bhk cleaning at 1000 rupees in Gurgaon. The rate is 3x to 4x of that",
        "and all I am saying is that 3X-4X of that is totally reasonable.",
        "This is a reverse 'There's power in a Union'. \n\nI remember domestic workers in my locality were pretty organized and successfully got a hike at multiple times.",
        "25K/month is necessary to sustain a family is what i meant, you can't sustain a family of 4 or more without that.",
        "Read the parent comment. Nowhere does it say that the rates are unreasonable. \n\nThe entire point is that the rates mentioned in the article is BS.\n\nBe kind. Read the comment before responding.",
        "I earn 10k bruh.told my reality",
        "TOI searched for rate card a decade ago using internet explorer finally they have the result.\n\n/s",
        "Depends on where you live... in cities, it hard but possible. But you can and families do survive on much less in majority of India. It won't be comfortable life and you won't save anything. Majority of my family belongs to lower middle class, and one them used to make ~ 25k per month and supported a family of 7. A cousin lives in a city and she makes ~ 13k per month and lives fine. The thing is majority of us here are so privileged that we find 25k as a measly amount but if you are ready to live a bit uncomfortable and be careful with money it's certainly a lot for universal basic income. \n\nThis is a complete separate point I am making, I certainly do not agree with the exploitation of domestic workers, they deserve to be payed much more.",
        "Indian society housewives are some of the vilest women on the planet. They way that they haggle and gang up against the poor labour class is fucking disgusting. There was a conservative woman in the Bangalore subreddit who was arguing against giving the house helps Diwali bonus as \"it'll make them entitled and they will demand and expect the same from other houses too\". Blood suckers they are!",
        "My dear manchild, people who are feminist will gladly stand up for the unprivileged too, especially when they are women. Do you really think the conservative housing society aunties care about feminism?",
        "Don't give ideas",
        "But they can only work for so many people. Who will this reduced and cheap workforce be directed towards? Presidents and connected people only... Most residents will be left with no one to employ, meanwhile select few will get cheapest of services.",
        "This is happening from top level. Corporates exploiting employees, they trying to get whatever they can as cheaply while paying all the loans and bills, etc etc. Salaries don't increase much, but inflation rises, labour cost increases, people feel like they are getting overcharged. Take government for example. They don't change costs from 10-15 years and expect drivers and workers to come at the same price. Employees pay out of their pockets in many cases",
        "If you can't pay decent wages, do your own cooking, cleaning, laundry. Nowadays there are machines that can help. Cook for multiple days and store. Simplify your menu.\nAsk your kids and spouse to help. Let kids wash their own laundry and wash their dishes, pack their lunch. It is not that hard. That's how world operates. There is nothing special about Indian households that need special help other than sheer laziness. My mom had to travel 3 hours in one direction for many years, so she taught us how to do our own stuff at a young age, and we survived without any domestic help. You can do it too.",
        "If our global employers did the same, everyone would be crying rivers",
        "While Iâ€™m fine with paying domestic workers fairly, Iâ€™m yet to find a worker who does household work with diligence and sincerity. They demonstrate professionalism when it comes to demanding rates and taking leaves, but when it comes to doing the work with sincerity, Iâ€™m yet to see some genuine cleaning being done. \n\nNothing against anyone but this is what Iâ€™ve experienced in our society in Pune.",
        "I'm in Hyderabad and I pay 2k for my domestic help for a 2bhk. What the hell are these people smoking?",
        "I don't have any sympathy towards the domestic help maids. They demand more, they straight away say I don't do this, don't do that...take unscheduled leaves. F them, they make 50K easily.",
        "This is how rich treat/exploit poor, anywhere in the world. For them a salaried person is rich. For a salaried person, the owner/shareholder of their company is rich. \n\nFrom another angle, if one gets paid 1k for utensils, its' 1k/hour. If he/she works 5 hours a day \\* 30 days a week, its 1.50 lakhs per month, tax free. And I have seen the quality of work they do. Plus other govt benefits they get, which we, salaried class people don't get. Remember Ladki Bahin yojna? \n\nI do understand the kind of pain they go through and I have full sympathy for them.",
        "Is it just my issue or is the image too blurred to read",
        "Same people who whine about corporates not giving handsome increments.",
        "Meri bai ko samjhao koi gst aur pf. Reality is no bai wants to learn all this.",
        "Good decision. The lower class usually hokes their pay by 50-100% every year while the middle class barely gets 5-10% increment",
        "> Iâ€™m yet to see some genuine cleaning being done.\n\nDo it yourself man. Otherwise you will never be happy.",
        "1bhk 450sqt house (ise house nahi room kehte hain), I paid 2.5k to clean it when I was sick and bedridden for 2 months. Plus paid her gst (usne khana bartan sab chori kara) on top of her salary. Usko Diwali bonus bhi chahiye tha. I told her to get out and never come back.",
        "These are pretty good rates lmao once you combine it all.\n\nR/india is just filthy rich and thinks everyone can afford this",
        "Donâ€™t you think the rates are unreasonable?",
        "I think you are reading it wrong. Usually these rates are to be additive based on the work.\n\nE.g. typically you'd have one person for sweeping,mopping, utensils, bathrooms and dusting. Acc to these rates that would be 1000+1000+1000+700 = 3700\n\nIt's still too low but just clarifying that's how I read it.",
        "Rich people are not assholes. Unless it's necessary quality to be a rich.\n\nBut I am sure if these poor people were to be born as rich they would do the same things",
        "There should be rate card because these maids try to loot you.Â ",
        "Most horrible comment.Â ",
        "So why donâ€™t you go and share her domestic duties?Â ",

I agree that there should be some sort of minimum wage, but you suggest 25k as the amount shows that you don't understand that it is a pretty big amount, and essentially not possible. It's not about being kind or not kind. The thing is the rates quoted in this article are bullshit. They are obviously underpaid but no one is getting 3 bhk cleaning at 1000 rupees in Gurgaon. The rate is 3x to 4x of that and all I am saying is that 3X-4X of that is totally reasonable. This is a reverse 'There's power in a Union'. I remember domestic workers in my locality were pretty organized and successfully got a hike at multiple times. 25K/month is necessary to sustain a family is what i meant, you can't sustain a family of 4 or more without that. Read the parent comment. Nowhere does it say that the rates are unreasonable. The entire point is that the rates mentioned in the article is BS. Be kind. Read the comment before responding. I earn 10k bruh.told my reality TOI searched for rate card a decade ago using internet explorer finally they have the result. /s Depends on where you live... in cities, it hard but possible. But you can and families do survive on much less in majority of India. It won't be comfortable life and you won't save anything. Majority of my family belongs to lower middle class, and one them used to make ~ 25k per month and supported a family of 7. A cousin lives in a city and she makes ~ 13k per month and lives fine. The thing is majority of us here are so privileged that we find 25k as a measly amount but if you are ready to live a bit uncomfortable and be careful with money it's certainly a lot for universal basic income. This is a complete separate point I am making, I certainly do not agree with the exploitation of domestic workers, they deserve to be payed much more. Indian society housewives are some of the vilest women on the planet. They way that they haggle and gang up against the poor labour class is fucking disgusting. There was a conservative woman in the Bangalore subreddit who was arguing against giving the house helps Diwali bonus as \"it'll make them entitled and they will demand and expect the same from other houses too\". Blood suckers they are! My dear manchild, people who are feminist will gladly stand up for the unprivileged too, especially when they are women. Do you really think the conservative housing society aunties care about feminism? Don't give ideas But they can only work for so many people. Who will this reduced and cheap workforce be directed towards? Presidents and connected people only... Most residents will be left with no one to employ, meanwhile select few will get cheapest of services. This is happening from top level. Corporates exploiting employees, they trying to get whatever they can as cheaply while paying all the loans and bills, etc etc. Salaries don't increase much, but inflation rises, labour cost increases, people feel like they are getting overcharged. Take government for example. They don't change costs from 10-15 years and expect drivers and workers to come at the same price. Employees pay out of their pockets in many cases If you can't pay decent wages, do your own cooking, cleaning, laundry. Nowadays there are machines that can help. Cook for multiple days and store. Simplify your menu. Ask your kids and spouse to help. Let kids wash their own laundry and wash their dishes, pack their lunch. It is not that hard. That's how world operates. There is nothing special about Indian households that need special help other than sheer laziness. My mom had to travel 3 hours in one direction for many years, so she taught us how to do our own stuff at a young age, and we survived without any domestic help. You can do it too. If our global employers did the same, everyone would be crying rivers While Iâ€™m fine with paying domestic workers fairly, Iâ€™m yet to find a worker who does household work with diligence and sincerity. They demonstrate professionalism when it comes to demanding rates and taking leaves, but when it comes to doing the work with sincerity, Iâ€™m yet to see some genuine cleaning being done. Nothing against anyone but this is what Iâ€™ve experienced in our society in Pune. I'm in Hyderabad and I pay 2k for my domestic help for a 2bhk. What the hell are these people smoking? I don't have any sympathy towards the domestic help maids. They demand more, they straight away say I don't do this, don't do that...take unscheduled leaves. F them, they make 50K easily. This is how rich treat/exploit poor, anywhere in the world. For them a salaried person is rich. For a salaried person, the owner/shareholder of their company is rich. From another angle, if one gets paid 1k for utensils, its' 1k/hour. If he/she works 5 hours a day \\* 30 days a week, its 1.50 lakhs per month, tax free. And I have seen the quality of work they do. Plus other govt benefits they get, which we, salaried class people don't get. Remember Ladki Bahin yojna? I do understand the kind of pain they go through and I have full sympathy for them. Is it just my issue or is the image too blurred to read Same people who whine about corporates not giving handsome increments. Meri bai ko samjhao koi gst aur pf. Reality is no bai wants to learn all this. Good decision. The lower class usually hokes their pay by 50-100% every year while the middle class barely gets 5-10% increment > Iâ€™m yet to see some genuine cleaning being done. Do it yourself man. Otherwise you will never be happy. 1bhk 450sqt house (ise house nahi room kehte hain), I paid 2.5k to clean it when I was sick and bedridden for 2 months. Plus paid her gst (usne khana bartan sab chori kara) on top of her salary. Usko Diwali bonus bhi chahiye tha. I told her to get out and never come back. These are pretty good rates lmao once you combine it all. R/india is just filthy rich and thinks everyone can afford this Donâ€™t you think the rates are unreasonable? I think you are reading it wrong. Usually these rates are to be additive based on the work. E.g. typically you'd have one person for sweeping,mopping, utensils, bathrooms and dusting. Acc to these rates that would be 1000+1000+1000+700 = 3700 It's still too low but just clarifying that's how I read it. Rich people are not assholes. Unless it's necessary quality to be a rich. But I am sure if these poor people were to be born as rich they would do the same things There should be rate card because these maids try to loot you. Most horrible comment. So why donâ€™t you go and share her domestic duties? True"
