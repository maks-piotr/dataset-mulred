        "Made some yesterday. South Indian here who came on a trip and took home the name, with about 2 kgs of the rajma. The rajma we buy normally just doesn't have the same taste, so I substitute black beans in place of the rajma once I was done with the rajma I bought from there. \n\nI follow this recipe : https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/rajma-madra-recipe/  .",
        "Nice! Hope you liked it! I've never made or had it with rajma but used black eyed beans or jackfruit instead. I suggest you try with jackfruit instead of the kidney beans once.",
        "Sure thing. You use tender jackfruit ? \n\nI will try with black eyed peas next.\n\nWe make it once in 2 months and love it.",
        "I use the unripe green one.",
        "I have, heard about it and tried it a couple of times."
