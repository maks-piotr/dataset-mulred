    "selftext": "https://in.mashable.com/culture/53970/hdfc-senior-vp-caught-abusing-employees-in-viral-video-sparks-linkedin-debate-on-toxic-work-culture\n\nThis article has the video. This is very common in corporate India. You will find such behaviour common everywhere, in Banking, Insurance, Healthcare (hospitals), and education.\n\nWhat is most concerning is such a situation in Banks and Hospitals, if employees are pressured then they will sell bad financial products to customers, the 2008 financial crisis happened because of sales people being pressured to push shaddy loans on to unsuspecting people, this led to loan defaults, which in turn led to a real estate crisis. \n\nIt also leads to questions such as:\n\n1) Will the bank be still profitable if such loans aren't pushed ? \n\n2) If the question to the above is No. Then the situation of our economy is grim. \n\nI'm surprised to see such behaviour by HDFC, I thought their growth was organic and not like this. It raises serious concern for me as an investor.\n\nEdit: I think the man in the video Pushpal Roy is. Chartered Accountant. What use is a CA degree if in the end you have to do sales and meet targets.",

        "This is just the reality of every sales job in India. It sucks. It gives us salespeople nightmares sometimes. I used to have trouble sleeping during my first sales job right out of college.\n\nWhen we tell this to our friends or family, they ask us to listen to it and forget. But its really not that easy. One time my manager was shouting at me over the phone while my parents were in the car with me. I had to sternly tell him to relax cos I didn't want my parents hearing the abuse I go through on a daily basis.\n\nWe have to be really tough to endure through this abuse. The only way to not get abused like this is to do our numbers. People then turn to unethical behaviour too - and I mean even this shouting and pressure is unethical.\n\nSales is not easy. We are abused every day like this. Multiple times a day even. The money is eventually really good. Like really really good. But to get there, you have to lose every spec of humanity you have in you.",

It's Not only the banks, but It's also all over the industry.\n\nWith regards to the video at the Bank, I think Getting Accounts, Insurance is their Job but why Force them to do it. The bank needs to make itself Visible and get more Customers. Arrange Workshops and Get Customers. You can't Force a Bank Employee to get Customers by hook or crook. And Decency Comes First. You also Show Your Bank in the Bad light.",

        "I agree, but in industries like banking and health care it leads to serious concerns. In banking such shaddy loans and products led to the 2008 financial crisis. If HDFC Bank has to push such sales to stay profitable, then what does it say about the health of our banking sector ? Will sale of such financial products be in the interest of the consumer ? \n\nI have seen similar things happening in private hospitals as well. Which is even more concerning.\n\nYou have also mentioned this in B2B roles, whereas this is B2C.",
        "banking has the most toxic sales culture, speaking from experience in investment banking, because they tend to engage in undifferentiated services/products.. theres a big tribal-hunter culture in financial services. if the sales isnt primed theres good chance that the opportunity will be lost to competitors, its a situation where youve got to be the first person to know about the opportunity, always switched-on and available, and the work culture can get toxic.\n\nthough i am aware that b2c sales doesnt pay as high as b2b but i believe they'd still be among the highest paid in the division",

This bank was the reason I would have fights with my family, suffered financial damage, almost lost hope. I will never forgive this bank for breaking my heart (literally).\n\nAlso I had told them about security issues before leaving. One of their golden child branch was looted recently. Fuck the lunchtime bank.",

I used to be under constant stress and in terror as soon as I woke up. Everyone was made to feel bad for leaving on time. During covid, we were made to feel bad for working from home. It was so pathetic. It hampered my creativity so much I couldn't deliver on time, while I had been a star performer on every team before and after that job.\n\nI didn't even serve my notice period. Just emailed my resignation and noped out of there. It took me 6 months to recover. The mental stress caused by that job scared me from another.
