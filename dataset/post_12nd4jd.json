But we seek to be a dead society at this point.

The fact that I am atheist who dislikes every religion doesn't matter. I will be judged pn the basis of my name. I feel hopeless.\n\n**edit: i have to make this edit because either people have poor comprehension or they are intentionally making it seem like i am supporting atiq ahmad when my post has nothing to do with it.

Atiq Ahmed killed many hindus, at that time where were you??? By the way the UP govt also took action against Hindu Vikas Dubey who was a gangster. So Its not about minority or majority.

So, after that his son was killed by the police in an encounter and today Atiq Ahmed and his brother were shot dead by assailant who posed as cameraman while he was being taken away by the police for medical checkup as ordered by the court.",

India is not a Hindu country. India is not a Muslim country. India is not a Christian country. India is a secular country. Religion should have absolutely no say between Indians and especially within the Indian government. The caste system also needs to be abolished, it is so backwards and useless. If you think about it, if India actually paid attention to the mess it was in and fixed it, do you really think the CCP in China wouls stand a chance? Against 1.4 billion people in a thriving democracy with a robust economy and strong trade and relations with almost everyone in the world? No way.

According to them that would have developed the country into a super power by now.\n\nIt really pains and frustrates me to see how these educated idiots dance naked at every small achievement of this country by giving credit to that Prime Moron but would become quiet when something major happens which is against the integrity and sovereignty of this country because of that Prime Moron only.

They should have been left to the judiciary. The thing is, I for one don't believe that gangsters rise up in vacuum. If he was half as dangerous as the reports claim, there is got to be involvement of the some khadi-clad politicians too. They wanted him dead so their dirty laundry doesn't get aired in the public. \n\nWe don't need to sympathise with the government. Rather, we need to question why none of the gangsters that are caught end up with fair trials. The pointblank shooting of _anyone_ thronged by media and police should be deeply worrying. Anyone whose family he killed or looted also gets thrown into the limbo because their cases get stuck and it's another clusterfuck to figure out where to get redressal from, now that the culprit is dead.",

    "light_cleaned_title": "Scared for the future of this country",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "40 lives have been taken for political gains and no one seems to care. In an society whose soul has not been this would have led to consequences. But we seek to be a dead society at this point. Supreme leader will get re-elected and there will eventually be a civil war. As a person from minority community, I am scared of never having a quality life and always remaining a second class citizen in country. The fact that I am atheist who dislikes every religion doesn't matter. I will be judged pn the basis of my name. I feel hopeless. **edit: i have to make this edit because either people have poor comprehension or they are intentionally making it seem like i am supporting atiq ahmad when my post has nothing to do with it. It'sabout pulwama attack and interview of satyapal malik.**",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "I can feel you, bro, like I have a Brahmin surname. Even though I love equality, I have friends from different castes and religions, but people judge me for my surname, and some people, especially political people, even openly bash us. Just ignore it. I am talking about pulwama and not some criminal who has been killed. Get assessed for learning disability if you can't comprehend this. i am sorry it was a misunderstanding from my side. i thought of something different lol, sorry again No worries. Sorry for being rude it's hard to distinguish between people really being dumb or not. Even that news should be scary because it's being used to distract from satyapal malik's statement. I feel you, OP. We have become a morally bankrupt nation. Previously, issues like these would have sparked protests. People would be out raging but now we have pindrop silence. I think the soul of our nation is dead :/ idk what to say or feel. But when citizens are afraid of questioning, protesting and voicing their grievances, what does that say about the government? #azadi ka amrit mahotsav? It's not even about being afraid most of them don't care because they'll get Hindu rashtra OP, I'm Hindu too and I never want Hindurashtra. India is supposed to be a secular country and that is something I will standby and protect in whatever limited capacity I can. So while I'm sure they are others like me who want to salvage whatever we can, I'm truly genuinely scared of being booked under UAPA or whatever and never getting a fair trial for years. This is the extent of fear that has penetrated deep inside. I was a DU student during the CAA protests and look at how they came down on the students. It is terrible Flying out this shithole of a country is the only way, obviously if you have the means for it. Just do it. this country is going down the drain and we all just can’t do shit. Only way is to escape to somewhere fr Up people are celebrating the open, lawless encounter of gangsters, overshadowing this interview. Not even realizing ki ye kal ka india h, lawless, and same unke saath bhi hoga. Exactly how dictatorship begins. I don't know why you're downvoted. If only people knew what it's like to be a potential second class citizen Facts Probably by the ones living in the Amrit Kaal You have asked a very important question. I know of many from such minority communities who have lost hope and have either migrated or planning to migrate . Primarily to - Canada - Australia - New Zealand - Turkey (buying property) Most of these people are well educated and had established professional careers in India, which they gave up. Perhaps you may have to take the same route. This raises an important question. What about the ones who are not privileged? Scary! I am in the same boat as you currently trying to see which degree is best to leave this place The sensible ones know once they establish a Hindu Rashtra. They will then go after the majority, using caste & language to divide. Look at the post. Being heavily downvoted I can only feel sorry. People have to seek refuge in other places Part of my wants to but there is part of me that loves this country and want to help it ij any way i can. I know it's stupid but whatever. I dont want people to raise their voice but atleast vote them out for the sake of this nation. Most of those who left, have not left happily. It is very hard. The came to power saying soldiers are dying at the border right... so they had to justify their claim Ofc, that is the best way to exert your political will Just hang in there. Just because you have a Brahmin surname, don't be ashamed of what other people do or say in the name of your caste. Be proud, be brave and be different. Hang on to your Brahmin surname despite what others say to you. Every tide passes away. Iss bhai ka alag scene chal raha hai Can you elaborate what CAA exactly was? It is quite a sad state of affairs. Supporting an ideology/party for the right reasons is fine but being a blind follower and hero worshipping people in power is just messed up! If only people understand how democracy is being compromised. I don’t have much hope for next two elections though as we do not have a formidable opposition. Karm hai bhai. Dont take it religiously, ateek ahmed killed many hindus, he had it coming. First thing that was not encounter that was murder and dictatorship Kab nahi thee lol pechle Sarkar jab thee tab mafia ke dictatorship puree UP ma chaltee thee lakho log mareha en mafia ke Vaja sa hajaro Kanon tuta ha en mafia ke Vaja sa tab kha tha tu ? Tab law yad nahi aya? Yes, but people from that particular minority community kill, Its secularism for you. But when the same happens, to you, you are worried about the county's future. Atiq Ahmed killed many hindus, at that time where were you??? By the way the UP govt also took action against Hindu Vikas Dubey who was a gangster. So Its not about minority or majority. Its about making people feel safe and make them believe that the govt. will do the same to people who make fun of law. Par tab maine live TV ke saamne nhi dekha tha aesa hote🤡 Bro has priorities Oky Mass murderer like Modi ? Mattress Advertisement Without a trial is where the problem lies. When law is taken into hands, the country becomes law less and the next is someone innocent dies. A lot actually People fail to realise that at the end of the day politicians don't really care about your religion, anyone who comes in their way will just end up getting crushed. Whether that's a Muslim, Christian, Dalit or anyone else. I can't help but be apprehensive about the future, since a lot of the younger generations have also been successfully propagandised. Ya fr, I just want to get the fuck Outta here, not specifically US or Canada but somewhere where there are not a million people per sq km and you can just have your own opinion. I didn't have sympathy for this guy back when he was killing innocents, I don't have sympathy for him now. Yep you trigged those bhakts You can change stuff and if you really care for the country get into the system, join civil services, Start a NGO, work for the betterment of the people, there is always a hope Thankfully I am living in a country where rule of law actually exists and which takes citizen rights very seriously. You live in world's largest 'democracy' but you know that criticising your leaders can land you in trouble. Btw you didn't answer my question instead indulged in threats. Why? Everyone's sense of right and wrong is different, further more many European countries even oppose Capital Punishment and here you are defending an encounter where the police are possibly complicit. It sets an awful precedent for the people. Yes, he was a mass murderer but he still deserved a death by the hands of the system atleast. People are literally celebrating a person's death, just goes to show how much we have been desensitised to crime. Whether he deserved to die or not, a murder should still be treated as a murder. Rang de Basanti had this dialogue. Salute to your positivity tbh Just had a heated discussion with friends about religion, cast and harmones. Not everyone relate to logical thinking. Bro which court found those two ( Atik n his brother) guilty? Hang them if they are found guilty but follow the due process of law. Otherwise it will become a jungle. Btw Modi never faced any trial in any court of law over his role in 2002 so how can a clean chit be given? And you talk about futility of exhuming the past. Cool. So are you willing to do the same for Nehru, Gandhi or even Mughals? Isn't an encounter done by police? Thats a murder by some order gangster. This type of shit is happening from 1948 , don't worry bro , nothing will happen , parties will come and go, focus on yourself There was many protests in recent times from CAA protest to farmers protest . From Neet aspirants protest to Agniveer protest You are right but exception are always there . It's very hard to give so powerfull mafia's a fair trial when even judges were scared of him Btw, they killed 3 from the family. Even a 12th graduate. Because of govt's karma, more people are against this govt than ever. So now as the prime minister said, \"Aap ye balancing ke chakkar mein naa padiyega.\" Now there is no point in staying neutral anymore. Forget anything positive, we are now forced to be extreme polar opposites. It is either you still support this govt or you are absolutely against it, there is no middle. I am chill. Don't worry.It's not night here yet. You should take it easy and please don't be a hypocrite. Bye! Bro stop playing the minority card. He was not any innocent muslim, he was a gangster. Would you also support if Lawrence bishnoi is muder/encountered tomorrow? Don't ask them, they have no idea. 😅 You know from which community is the IAS topper this time ? True!! What 40 killings are.you referring to? >will do the same to people who make fun of law. The irony to say this after justifying an extrajudicial killing😭. Homie your own government is making a joke of the law oh go deeper. this is not the problem of the world. this situation is not indigenous to India. Haha!! Me too!! These RSS thugs are destroying the country. Hopefully before 2029 I will be out adults understand. children dont if that's how things are to be dealt with then people should carry gun then!! Shut down Courts and criminal proceeding !! Kill everyone you disagree with. Is that what you want India to be? UP has bigger mafia than Atiq. What happened to those who killed Subodh Kumar? What about those who attacked Owaisi! What about Kuldeep singh, Brijesh Singh , Raja bhaiya, Dhananjay Singh, Brijbhushan Singh, Udbhan Singh and many like them? They have more blood on their hand than Atiq. Man i read somewhere, an average person is not bright but 50% of population is below him. Lol, gaandh jaladiya na tera? Salein jo sawal pucha uska tho jawab de nahi paya. Chaddi pehen k betho. “Up govt also took against Hindu Vikash dubey who as a gangstar” So you’re implying that the extra judicial killing was state sponsored? You’re worried about wrong things. You should be worried about getting recruited instead of worrying about all the gangsters that happen to be from the same minority club. Harmones Apparently you know nothing about how Mumbai got rid of gangsters. It's quite a grey area and I don't blame any govt or police cause there's a time when someone has to dirty their hands to clean up mess. Not pro bjp or something or if you refer to Mumbai encounters this is nothing. In our world law is written as black and white but in reality it's all grey.... Bro you're not a minority anymore We are a dead civilisation. Fact Agreed. Still on live tv? Thoda zyada ho gaya🫠😅 Damn! That's a hige six, that's called an excellent state of mind which can simplify whats wrong and whats right. You made my day. That one sentence is enough for all the conversations and debates. 90s me technology advance nahi tha na 😂 nahi to live stream hi kar dete I believe in Danzo supremacy though 🤣 Bhai bhai😂😂 I live abroad and am not being able to make out what happened. Can anyone enlighten me about the incident in question? Where PM is a guy who launches pogroms on citizens then this is bound to happen eventually. Moral is subjective, if you go with West value , not all don't work here. Just move to better place OP if you can & don't watch news if you are sensitive person. context? Do we know who killed him? Who killed them? Do we know? What is the basis for any of this discussion? Just rumors. according to sources, Opposition leaders, who had questioned the Asad Ahmed encounter and sough an inquiry, have been placed under house arrest. 💀 There wont be any civil war Yes, ofcourse it was everyone knows it, if you think high profile gangsters are just casually ending up dead due to some coincidence then you are really dumb Atiq Ahmed was a high profile gangster and muscle bearer during the samajwadi party government when bjp came into power there was a major crackdown and he was arrested in 2019 and more than 100 cases were lodged against him but few days ago a key witness in Atiq Ahmed case was shot by his son. So, after that his son was killed by the police in an encounter and today Atiq Ahmed and his brother were shot dead by assailant who posed as cameraman while he was being taken away by the police for medical checkup as ordered by the court. I see. Thanks for the info Which 40 lives? What are you talking about? Can someone share the news article about this? Arre bhai Hindu khatre mein hai not atheists. Please follow the proper agenda. I don't think it will happen anytime soon. Time to leave the country vro So if a gangster's son killed some innocent person. Then someone else killed the gangster and his family, this is a bad thing? Or am I missing something? Sorry to be pedantic but that's not how averages work😅 What about those involved in hathras case or criminals like brijbhushan who claimed their killings on camera, encounter them too. It's obvious what's happening. Maybe because they failed to protect Atiq Ahmed from getting shot? they should have risked their life and provided body cover while shots were being fired to save him and his brother or maybe because the cops shot his son dead while he was shooting at them I can't give two fucks about criminals like atiq ahmad. People like him need to be dealt with despite what religion they belong to. Would have preferred if it was through law but whatever. I have no clue how you jumped to me supporting criminals from this post. But guess what, the govt is using this encounter to distract from the fact that their negligence led to death of 40 people who were serving the country and it seems to be working. Obviously you don't care about that because Hindu muslim is all that matter to you. Congrats on getting your Hindu rashtra. yes its a bad thing cuz then its the wild west everyones killing everyone but the judiciary is too slow and lots of people had grudges against him so finally karma got to him This post us not about some criminal that was killed. It's about the government's negligence (or maybe plan) led to pulwama attack. But bhakts here are trying to make it like I am talking about the encounter just so they can distract from real issue of pulwama. OOTL - which 40 killings are we discussing here? Are you fuckers dense or what. I am talking about the pulwama attack and not UP. That's the median person, not the average person. As everyone here seems to make it seem like I am talking about atiq ahmad case, I am attaching the link of what I am talking about. But guess govt's propaganda is working. No one gives a damn about the important issue. Good going my fellow countrymen. Honesty, India has been really struggling for a while, everyone just ignores it and leaves. The primary problem I see is that the very root of the Indian Constitution was violated. India is not a Hindu country. India is not a Muslim country. India is not a Christian country. India is a secular country. Religion should have absolutely no say between Indians and especially within the Indian government. The caste system also needs to be abolished, it is so backwards and useless. If you think about it, if India actually paid attention to the mess it was in and fixed it, do you really think the CCP in China wouls stand a chance? Against 1.4 billion people in a thriving democracy with a robust economy and strong trade and relations with almost everyone in the world? No way. We need to throw out the shackles of the past, these hurdles are simply mental, and India will most certainly become the new dominant power in the world. Great thought. That person had a 40+yr in being criminal... Killing countless person, but yes, since you all didn't saw them getting murdered on tv, well it doesn't matter. Wow... Idiots... Joke of the century.... Happy school shooting, police brutality and living paycheck to paycheck Wild West is bad, but how does it make it a minority thing? Just cause he was a Muslim? It's not like the govt killed him, right? But then again, aren't there loopholes in our judicial system where even after all the crimes he committed, he might have got life imprisonment? It's not everyday that someone gets encountered. It definitely doesn't feel safe, but we do need to draw the line to where we need to step up over the judiciary. Think of the families whom he killed. Think of the relatives of those families. They must have been relieved. P.S. I'm not pro BJP or anything. RSS will ensure that the country moves backwards. As long as it has claws in the system, the society will continue to get fucked. That was a propoganda by RSs. Those guys worked for RSS and killeed to flare up communal tension. Pulawama? You mean our soldiers? And you think Modi killed them? Phuleama attack was created by RSS to win vote banks of Hindu. I had a same feeling 25 years ago. And the situation and people have worsen! So just think what would you do after 25 years, with same state of affair or further degraded state? Wow... He just came clean after loosing all his assets... What a saint... I hope he is not a politician and have nothing to gain from this and is a concerned citizen... Who just kept his mouth shut for this long time as he thought this may topple the government... Nope, it's not minority thing at all he wasn't killed because he was a Muslim. He was killed because he was gangster just look at his chargesheet and fir lodged against him the most famous one is of him killing MLA Raju Pal just because he won against his brother in an election lol. Yeah, like how is government responsible for his death there were literally gunmen shooting at him what were the cops supposed to do jump in front of the bullet and save him? and why would they its not like he was a great saint of a person who had done lots of social work Seems like it even if he didn't it was negligence on state's part which was later used for political mileage. Please just watch the interview. Bhai chuus na band kar bhai, sambit patra ke liye bhi thoda rakh. You are in the ‘50% of the population below’ That’s not how averages works. It's not the government negligence it's the failure of IB, RAW, NIA and M.I. to gather intelligence about such a large scale attack and apprehending it. Those idiots do not have that much brain power Govt was asked for 5 aeroplane which seems to be the protocol for moving such large convoys and they rejected to provide it. What could be the reason. Pulwama what? You need to be clear about exactly what you are ranting about man. I don't give a fuck about his life. But the fact that he was killed while being surrounded by police and in front of the camera , does that tell u about the lawlessness in this country? About UP police? About people who are celebrating this instant form of imaginary justice? Wow... Idiots... Just watch the link or read up about the interview. They want news to cover this pulwama attack mann Oh really? Let's see how much safe u will feel when you raise religious issues in front of public Completely agree, i just can't stand the polarisation this govt has created. Now it is so difficult to even talk to friends since you know. Either you avoid topics or act ignorant! But can never have an open conversation like earlier times. How will people protest when they are being silenced in the bud. Even a doubt and they arrest under uapa! They just want the country to be burned and colonized by Chinese. Future Indians will live in rehabilitation centres like the ones built for uighur muslims. While these Gujju bastards will run away from the country tucking their tail between their legs. maybe could be idk cuz i too read somewhere that intelligence input warning of pulmawa attack was ignored and in the aftermath of attack bjp capitalised it in 2019 elections He is talking about pulwaama 40 deaths Banana Republic That is bound to happen. People of minority community are always labelled as ISI agents. one of the reasons why I stay silent on this topic during my office hours. Yeah, let's leave the country so that those who are economically worse off and can't leave continue to suffer! Everyone thinks they are logical. An atheist will think they are logical and so will an religious person. This interview dropped a couple of days ago and yesterday Bhakts were bootlicking Modi because Qatar now accepts INR as a currency. Bhakts were frustrated that this country didn't have someone like Modi leading the country during the last 70 years. According to them that would have developed the country into a super power by now. It really pains and frustrates me to see how these educated idiots dance naked at every small achievement of this country by giving credit to that Prime Moron but would become quiet when something major happens which is against the integrity and sovereignty of this country because of that Prime Moron only. Bhakts are the most shameless and spineless people of this world at present. I just Said if you have the means. We can’t go into the minds of these bigots and change anything. Everyone is corrupt be it a left wing or right wing. But the right wing not only is corrupt but also hate mongering against the minorities 🤧 No it doesn't. Averages are swayed by outliers. What you're describing is a median. Not really. That was then, but if one really does follow the government's claims of having improved law and order, one should question why we're taking that dated approach again. The job of the police is to arrest, not pass verdict. They should have been left to the judiciary. The thing is, I for one don't believe that gangsters rise up in vacuum. If he was half as dangerous as the reports claim, there is got to be involvement of the some khadi-clad politicians too. They wanted him dead so their dirty laundry doesn't get aired in the public. We don't need to sympathise with the government. Rather, we need to question why none of the gangsters that are caught end up with fair trials. The pointblank shooting of _anyone_ thronged by media and police should be deeply worrying. Anyone whose family he killed or looted also gets thrown into the limbo because their cases get stuck and it's another clusterfuck to figure out where to get redressal from, now that the culprit is dead. Any sane neutral person can also understand that this was done to distract the attention from revelations made by Satyapal Malik. This government is the most shameless government of the independent India and we Indians are the stupidest people of this planet the actually let this government brazenly do whatever they want. A person who has no educational qualification, cannot give answer to any question, make claims like a moron, taunt opposition leaders like a roadside goon shouldn't even be allowed to occupy the highest post but not only is he occupying that post shameless people are actually worshipping him. All because we Indians are shameless, spineless and stupid. Yes and that means the educated upper class of the country leaves because they're in a privileged position and others have to go through shit and the situation in the country becomes worse. You do realise the minorities won't suddenly get better if the privileged leave the country? People will still suffer. I see people worry about future. You just have to focus on your productive life left. After that it's not your problem. This only works if you don't have kids. If you have kids then also it's doesn't matter. Because you can't to do anything Harmones I don’t live in India but I will tell you this, over the next 25 years no country on the planet will transform more than India. It’s GDP will explode, jobs will come in, development will occur, and people will be lifted out of poverty. This will fix a lot of the political problems and issues with corruption and lack of state capacity. This is India’s moment. Hang in there. Just look at what Ray Dalio said. Thank you for the clarification! You'll be hard pressed to find a nation that doesn't persecute it's minorities. It sucks, but speaking from experience. Dude, UP and Bihar are the last places where a nuanced approach to law and order would work. Even in a much more educated South, cops had to \"encounter\" the accused rapists just few years back. People aren't that naive. Everyone knows who had sheltered these criminals for all these years. Most of the people who had suffered these criminals just feel relieved that at least one such scumbag is less. They don't expect the law to give them justice anyway, so take this as a consolation. There won’t be a civil war, those days are over The army and military is too strong and with nukes, the west will help to ensure this civil war they speak off doesn’t turn into a world war due to proliferation of nukes to terrorists. Even I love my place, but after watching Umar Khalid's journey ( where he got punished for his good deeds and still in jail) i decided to move on. How is propaganda so deeply entrenched?? Even when people recognize that the party and the people they have elected over and over again are absolute scumbags, they default to China bad? China did not elect Yogi ji or Modi ji 92 Mumbai Police Encounter Squad : Hum chutye hai ? You mean like how Nupur Sharma raised and living in hiding or that is something doesn’t come under your radar? Well, when it comes to religion, caste logic takes a back seat. This is not just limited to India but is prevalent everywhere. I am sure none of the news channels will cover this. Media, in its current state is one of the main reasons for the sad state of affairs in this country. And how does this make you feel unsafe? Historically we have been like that. Otherwise we wouldn't have needed the British to bring democracy to India The Machines are all rigged. First we need to bring back the paper ballots. Ofcourse that can be manipulated but, not to a larger scale. Paper ballots will ensure that ditectorship doesnt find its roots in the future too. Agreed. I would give you an award, but no money The reason everyone thinks you're talking about something else is your second paragraph. It's totally unnecessary and is confusing everyone. [Think it is based off this George Carlin comedy skit.](https://youtu.be/AKN1Q5SjbeI) As years go by i still don’t understand the political class in this country. While i do like the stream line nature of the bureaucracy in the recent past. There has been a lot of govt sponsored schemes, economical RBI has implemented a lot of digital infra for payment systems but what i don’t understand is why the political class doesn’t seem to want to uplift the country. This interview if its true is one of the worst nay the worst thing this present govt has done. As you study and go deep down the problems in Indian subcontinent you will find most of the work that BJP has claimed are actually done by bureaucrats who spend day in and day out on the field. This is simply pathetic and abhorrent. I really wish the educated youth to take upon the mantle of politics without craving for absolute power. Implementation of schemes which are available if done properly would have made this country so strong. The infra development which Nitin Gadkari has taken upon, he has been silently improving it while the whole other BJP is in shambles. Even the most abled BJP leaders currently who have been working in their ministries are bureaucrats who don’t make it to the newspaper i.e. Ashwini Vaishnaw. Under him the Vande Bharat, increased sanitation security, less derailment and even the employees at railways in the recent years are coming on time else they are suspended ,this has happened but whenever their is a ribbon cutting ceremony you can find the PM there. What i truly believe is to develop this country who need people who don’t run after clout and just work and that work gives them satisfaction not the other way around. Did you know there are provisions where even opposition leader can be made ministers. But will the ruling party ever do this, no. The country is in deep threat by these people and how much you read understand and understand and emphasise problems i am yet to find a answer. And I am a woman and I still thought that was wrong too. Hyderabad was the police deflecting responsibility by encountering the accused so no one questions why such a heinous crime occured in the first instance. You would think if everyone knows, at least some people would critique more than to just throw such issues up into the oblivion of \"chalta hai\". _Erosion of trust in the judiciary is worrisome._ I completely get it, this is cathartic. Still extrajudicial. Still not right. > Supreme leader will get re-elected and there will eventually be a civil war. Civil war you say, let’s you will pick up arms for the civil war can you tell me exactly what will motivate you to do so ? By reading a bunch of articles, watching tv debates, or something else? Enlighten us what has been bothering you so much that you will risk everything and pick up arms. Sometimes the boundaries between right and wrong are not that clear. We don't live in ideal society, we never lived in one. A lot of us were just sheltered from such news and made to believe in things like justice, law, and system being impartial. You grow up and realize these are just toys in the hands of powers that be, regardless of ideology. So now if BJP is playing around with them to make it's supporters happy, earlier it was BSP and SP using them for the same end. Bhag ja na uk, us, kya dikkat hai ? There is a word called Empathy! It’s a human thing. Just saying. Dont get pissed of buddy, its was just a mis understanding Bhai police waalo ke beech mei random banda aaya sar pe bandook rkhi aur chala di Jaise tv serial chal rha ho Are you saying there should be a middle? Because if you understand the end goal of the government is genocide and the sale of any assets the country has to the rich what's the middle level of opposition to that? Gandhu learn to comprehend what i am writin Dude I literally mentioned I don't want to go to US or Canada Man, at least I'm smart somewhere then. Sorry to disappoint you... But everyone says that... But no one does that...in the end They go to US and Canada... Bcz they offer more money...saw many in my life... Wow... U don't give fuck to his life but ur vocal about his murder? I live 3km away from where this happened... People were literally celebrating his death... We lived a long time in time where the law was just some written letters. Don't comment when u r not in the situation... Criticising while living outside the circle of influence due to some self-centered moralism is the worst mentality anyone can have... actually u don't even have the right to criticize... Anyone can open the news and criticize others actions over a cup of comfort... But they don't have the guts to do what is necessary to clean the society... Talk of justice and judicial and moral equality only prevails when both the sufferer and doer are on the same economic and societal standard... So just fuck off.. Teri gand pe goli mar ke jaenge iske bacche phir bhi tujhe up police nhi bacha paegi. Kyo ki jab goli chalti hai to ye professionals apparently piche hoke Tamasha dekhte hai . So no bro I am not in danger you are , and sorry to say ur part of the problem. May be... But atleast I will not stand there and watch jab tere gand pei koi goli marega🤣🤣🤣 Mai usko goli mar dunga... So problem is not me... But people like u who can only shout from the comfort of home and start talking in Hindi when someone talks logic bcz gand mei aur damn toh hai nahi tumhara... Yehi fark hai katta mentality aur law mentality mai tu yehi krta reh. Don't worry about me , qualified ssb will graduate from IMA . Bas ye bolunga kisi ko goli marna last option hota hai (waise bahut asan hai) kyo ki baki options ek civilized lawful society me pehle explore kiye jate hai. Par chodo Encounter fans ko kya pata Encounter is the easy way out. Matlab koi tujhe goli marega and galti sei Mai wahi rahunga toh tujhe nahi bachake, I will first think about law and society and will say \"thik hai Bhai iska hi kasoor hoga... AAP mar k joa... Baad mei dekh lenge...\" And hope for the best that they will keep me alive for the law and justice though I have seen their face... Wow... Gazab ka logic hai bhai... Tujhe toh Nobel peace prize Dena hai... Yaar tu drunk hai ya dumb? Police ki responsibility thi use alive leke Jaha jaha bhi ja rha tha vo . Koi bhi ake police ke samne captive prisoner ko ake goli mar ke chala jaega aur police dekhti rhegi? Aur fir log isse celebrate karenge? Rather than questioning the lawlessness and incompetent police officers. Not to mention this happens in third world lawless countries , not in \"vishwaguru\" countries , especially in apparently the most \"lawful\" state . Baki kon kitna imandar hai tujhe bhi pata hoga hi adhe to vikas Dubey se mile hue the toh uska bhi encounter krdiya warna inki poll khul jati. And is par bhi log tali bajaenge to fir mai kya hi bolu! Maje kro Bhai . Hahahaha... Idiots... Why is india supposed to be a secular country ? Also, secularism in its definition is contradictory. Multiple religions can never coexist, period. Thats a quote by norm i suppose >Are you saying there should be a middle? I don't think that's what they are saying. OC is commenting on the erosion of centrism due to polarisation. They are not saying, there should be a centre, given the current situation, it is impossible to be Centrist. Civil war is incredibly unlikely because complacency is inherent in us Indians. As long as something doesn't bother us directly, we choose to ignore it. And then there are those miscreants who entertain themselves through the tragedy of others. And yet others who sway the miscreants and the ordinary folks to serve their own purposes. As for the minority situation, I believe things will begin improving within two decades. If the distribution is normal (which most likely it is) then it is the same We need UP as a role model to not make our states like them. Fair enough.....i agree it is tough, emotionally, physically, financially wrecking but in the end it is all about how much are you ready to still have that hope that things might change one day and that will be the northern star while going through all this turmoil Supreme leader will get reelected and eventually there will be a civil war sounded like you were talking about some arab countries. What are your thoughts about USA? Even low life criminals are shot there by the cops, Do you think the future of that country is also in peril? Stop over thinking these things, follow basic law and live your life Cast Taken for political gain?? He LITERALLY said it was done by Pakistan. Why are you trying so hard to spin this? It's an intelligence failure. So the Mumbai attack was also done by India? And people think this \"Good Over Evil\" is a great concept while its cherrypicked lol yeah right, making maulana happy is better, legalizing triple talaak, protecting every outdated practice of islam to make muslim leaders happy and nurturing extremism and making muslims fool in the name of religion is always good. No no, muslims don't need scholarships, homes, progressive mentality. they need religious rights exclusively according to islam. yeah. atheist belonging to minority community? judged by name? as far as i know, there r many muslims who r working, supporting the bjp etc. conclusion, non BJP people don't give a shit about muslims, they just want to look cool. they r happy if muslims r poor, backward etc. they want madarsa? give them 1000 times even if they lack behind world studying in madarsa, even if hate is being taught in madarsa. Yeah he said it was an intelligence failure. It was always clear it is one. BJP is not what they pretend to be. But what do you wanna say? Do you wanna say those people are killed by the BJP or because the BJP is not competent? But they already caught Ateeq. Fake encounters have been ongoing since 5 years already and theres not been much noise about them. Killing on national tv is a completely different thing. Law and order are clearly not the priority religious minority is a joke, anyone can become minority or majority by converting, wtf? No atheists, rational, leftist, liberal, self proclaimed secular person seems to be logical. everyone just rant and rant, beating around the bush. no one want to learn or provide cause, reasons. the only solution they have is, vote out bjp then india will become heaven? immature kids don't even know that there r problems existing before bjp, before partition, independence, before establishment of rss, hindu mahasabha etc. But no, bjp bjp only problem bip, bhakts, rss, sanghi. Lol. self proclaimed intellectuals r just frustrated kids who just want to look cool. you say this is not related to atiq ahmed but timing of the post just say something else TF? Did you really type this? 100% true. BJP has done a lot for the society. People are just believing the opposition party medias which brand BJP as communal and opposing without knowing the facts. India is more respected globally due to one man and that's Modi. That was official encounter. And here some thugs killed a man under arrest in front of 5-6 police men, do you understand difference. Moreover even Mumbai encounters were controversial as some suggest it was done by other gangsters through policemen to remove competition. At the end of the day, lawless and anarchy is never good for country. ✌️ sarcasm ✌️ Intelligence follows a normal distribution. In a normal distribution, the average (mean) and the median are the same. So in this case, it is correct to say that 50% are below it. Hey calm down.Take a break from media. Go outside and roam all around India for a vacation. You will notice media and reality are in two different directions. This is the time when you can be a part of the growth story of India, make maximum money out of it. Once you are done, take your decision whatever it is. Imagine their family member is killed in accident by someone from bjp. Can they hope to get justice ? I find it so hilarious that people automatically reply with this when they read that comment. That just shows your limited education and how you just parrot what you read in comments. So you know, Intelligence follows a normal distribution. When something follows a normal distribution, the median and mean (average) are the same in those cases. >I find it so hilarious that people automatically reply with this when they read that comment. That just shows your limited education and how you just parrot what you read in comments, while thinking you are somehow clever and knowledgeable. > >So you know, Intelligence follows a normal distribution. When something follows a normal distribution, the median and mean (average) are the same in those cases. Intelligence follows a normal distribution. When something is normal distributed, the median and mean are basically the same thing. Thank you. At least someone who has some education. I find it hilarious how when someone brings that quote there are always those who reflexively parrot the same reply, which makes it obvious they just learned if from reading those comment a lot on the web. It's just funny how these people think themselves smart and educated when they try to correct someone, yet all they do is reveal that that their education is lacking. It's a lost cause. Most people with the means are leaving the country for this exact reason. It's called the great brain drain of India. It's the only way out now. The Reddit/India is so super interesting. I write that from Berlin. It´s gold for people who want to understand Indian society. then dont be scared The fact that you're assuming intelligence follows a normal distribution indicates that you buy into the fact that IQ scores force fitted to a bell curve are an actual indicator of intellect. The normal distribution is an idealized and simplified distribution assumption to make simple statistical modelling even easier. You can't fit a loosely defined characteristic of the entire human population onto a pretty little curve and expect it to mean anything. When you say median you mean median. For a given random distribution, which is what intelligence actually is, median might or might not be equal to the average depending on your sample. The simplest assumption I'd make for intelligence is a log normal distribution and even that is an oversimplification that just allows for no meaningless negative intelligence scores. They made a terminological mistake, and while I was admittedly pedantic about it, you chose to insult my intelligence and embarrass yourself without knowing anything about me. The mean/median mistake is very common, calling it out (politely) helps people not make that mistake when it matters. i think we should be thinking about our future not this bhai lakin encounter to sahi tha ! I stopped being a secular way long back and it doesn't mean I will kill any Muslim it's just that I am gonna stand by my religion just like the persons from other religions. Google, how NYC got rid of its mafias in the second half of the 20th century. People are celebrating atiq Ahmed murder because he fucked up the whole system in his days. Pulwama attack was a intelligence failure, this has been a known fact since long. But every attack is a intelligence failure. 9/11 was an intelligence failure, 26/11 was an intelligence failure. Btw, as minority community member, you dint have to be scared. You have to work towards making your community modern. Encourage women education. Because there is this particular minority in existence, which will not accept the modern way of living at any cost. This has been hurting their prosoerity since long, and they just can't seem to realise that. All of this is sensational because media, the fourth pillar of democracy, is compromised. Which party makes the government is of as much concern to the regular citizens as much their cellphone connection provider matters—whoever gives best services gets chosen. So this is no longer about “Modi nahi to kaun”.. i mean Jio nahi toh Airtel, and that Nahi toh Vodafone.. it’s that simple. We don’t need a government trying to control narratives or what gets reported because this government “has power over us” which is violation of the game itself—much like Jio or Airtel reporting only the wrongs of the other while covering up human rights violations and corruption within them. That government would be termed as “dangerous” should be banned like athletes are banned if they dope, or violate the game. Rise above cast and religion and stop playing victim card, u will feel all safe!! >distract the attention from revelations made by Satyapal Malik. do you really think, average people give a fuck about his interview. > Previously, issues like these would have sparked protests. why would any common person protest for a gangster? Yeah it’s probably also media coverage, we don’t realise the scale of the protests since they don’t get same coverage anymore I’m Northern Irish (here because my partner is Indian). Can confirm - logic takes a backseat where religion / sectarianism is concerned in my country too. Sadly we humans seem to have a natural tendency to split into tribes and hate on each other. > complacency is inherent in us Indians *Golden Temple and Gujarat enter the chat* India is essentially becoming a Ethnic Democracy like Malaysia and Israel. This is what happens when you elect right wing governments. They focus on Ethnic lines and promote one community making them the master race and all the other communities as second class citizens. To keep foreign investors and business community happy. They liberalize the Economy and allow foreign companies to set up offices in India. If you're younger than 30, immigrate to Canada or UK, if it's too late for you send your children. honestly every day I am terrified of the state of this country Definitely not at the scale of civil war. The emergency period can arguably be put forth as one of those situations. I plan to go to new Zealand as it will easiest for me to convert my license there but I domt want to leave my family here. I have simple argument against this satya pal mailk guy he is like one of those kids who cry relentlessly and roll on the floor of a shopping mall just cause his/her parents didn't get what heshe wanted he is the same case as of Subramaniyam swamy. Its simple if u find inconsistencies in the govs working ur a governer go report the matter to courts get judiciary in provide them ur findings game over. And one needs to clearly acknowledge this how interview questions are framed earlier and provided to the candidate it happens every where(dont wana trust me, dont trust ) ever other politician does. Now i produce a name gen kjs Dhillon he wrote about pulwama in his book its was his 7th day as posted in chinar corps and the attack was carried out he said we had no intelligence input and it was a intelligence faliure will anyone accept this argument no cause it doesnt fit in ur convince but for me i will anyday prioritise gen kjs dhillon's statement over satya pal mailk cause as a citizen i am entitled to have reservations over people for me a army personnel who takes full responsibility of the situation and one of the best organization india has since independence i trsut their word and rest case of staya pal mailk this mann came out and disclosed meeting minutes of him with pm . Now its upto u whom do u trust satya pal mailk or the one who operates The BJP doesn't really see any point in attacking Old people as it just causes more negative publicity. They realized this after the Mohammed Akhlaque lyncing. Good luck with your new Zealand plan. Wow til. I would have definitely put my money on intelligence being a bell curve or something. Guess I know where I are in the distibushun. >40 lives have been taken for political gains and no one seems to care Don't be stupid . Pulwama was used by Modi for electoral gains but they didn't do it . There is enough evidence of how pak was behind it . next what 26/11 , uri everything BJP did . Any sane politician would have used it . MMS-Congress didn't post 26/11 and it resulted into rise of BJP I dislike Modi but a strong reaction was needed against Pak . They need to understand they we can fuck them too . Balakot wasn't the big thing , what india was prepapred to do after balakot pak's counter escalation is the big stuff and ISI and pak army's knows it too. >but somewhere where there are not a million people per sq km and you can just have your own opinion. North West Africa? And what about the violence? The loss of basic rights? What growth story? We are already coming up with gender neutral names. Why not religion neutral? That ought to help somewhat. Not being sarcastic here. Just brainstorming. >pulwama attack and interview of satyapal malik. lesson in context >So you know, Intelligence follows a normal distribution Citations, please? \"Scared for the future of this country\" Pakistanis and Bangladeshi also had same thought and look at them. Unfortunately, people who voted for Pakistan still exist in India. but the problem is this man was free for around 40 years and court was not able to do anything . So even though this shootout was extremely wrong ; many families got justice as they all had lose hope. now we should understand that in states like up and bihar encounter has become an only option because the link are so deeply rooted in grounds that one has no choice but to cut it down Wait till the actual purge starts Median is also an average in statistics, if the data is not mostly made of outliers ie many highs and lows I belong to a OBC 2 A category . I support modi to completely erase my community . I don't have a proud history to say my ancestors were a great people. They were shitheads who got repressed by all. I neither have faith in my community nor respect their culture . If only upper castes or mullas live in this country idc . Because they are the only peeps who must be proud . OBC and SC sT peeps we don't have anything proud to live other than shitty life we had. My community were raped by savarnas , Muslims and europeans. I hate all of them . I am not proud of my culture or my ancestors or my people. Let them all die . Seriously I don't care. Have u seen UP budget . 50% budget of UP goes for pension. > Google, how NYC got rid of its mafias in the second half of the 20th century. can you share reference please? I tried google but couldn't find anything concrete. I am from UP And I am not celebrating it. Neither did I ever vote for BJP Or ever will. Have warned people against it. You do realize Up has more people than that of Russia and Brazil and probably most of Western EUROPE. Love the sweeping statement people make. Well written, you won't believe it these are my exact thoughts lately. Because that's the hip thing to feel on social media Hmmm You won't find an answer when was the last time you felt happy about our country's achievement? and what was it? Ik. Even I'm from up and not celebrating, but let's agree, majority are Hey, thanks. I am certain several people are seeing this, not just you and I. Do you even know what ur saying. I am an atheist so I am already minority!!! We are f*****. Our country is slowly but steady moving towards fascism under modi regime....Sad state of affairs. How's the situation in Europe(Especially from POC POV? The difference is this is a vote-winning machine. Tomorrow if the majority say they believe in spaghetti monsters we will have rallies where people on stage are eating Maggi noodles. They are not beholden to any community and will do whatever will win them votes. UK is shithole mate. Trust me on this The government is not trying to distract anyone. This is exactly what the voters expect the government to do. This is the mandate given by the majority, and the government is delivering on its promises. The only agenda is persecution of Muslims, there is no distraction. India will never have a shadow minster, we'll be lucky if existing minsters and their staff and as you mentioned bureaucrats work diligently and in general the corruption culture drastically goes down. Talent in the country gets discouraged because of corruption at many levels Future is bright simply because Indians are bright. Social media and TV media is not representative of everyday Indians. Most of us work hard and do our job to sustain our families the rest is just noise for fear mongering and elections Germany terrible, there is a nazi party at bundestag they became 12% last election. If he had opened his mouth in the courtroom many of his colleagues who are still very active in politics would've gone down. Just one of the things which separate justice from revenge. It was never easy to identify police from gundas in UP. Exactly. Reminds me of a while back when Vikas dubey was similarly snatched of his life. Pure deja vu, actually. See, Britishers knew a fact very well. We will lethargically tolerate every crimes as long as it doesn't offend our religious sentiments. You can rob and even murder lakhs of Indians, no problem. But interfer with our religion or culture and you'll have a mutiny. Case in point, 1857 Rebellion began with cartridges dipped in cow & pig fat that offended both Hindus and Muslims. Till then East India soldiers had no problem working for British, fighting their wars and even shooting down their own countrymen on their orders (i.e. Jallianwala Bagh massacre). Mars mission Most people just care about themselves which is natural otherwise who would care for you. Look at all the educated, privileged, billionaire living in India. Do you think them staying or not staying in this country is helping the unprivileged in any meaningful way?? The point is that if someone is leaving the country because the government is oppressing the minorities then them leaving won't magically emancipate the minorities. And yes, most people just care about themselves, that's why we are in such a situation where minorities are being oppressed this is why being altruistic is much better for everyone. And I never mentioned billionaires anywhere and they're completely irrelevant to the discussion but to answer your question yes, I feel that rich people staying in India instead of somewhere else is better because the taxes they actually pay (after evading most of them because of loopholes) will be beneficial to the country instead of them residing somewhere else and not paying tax at all. Do you know how batman keeps Gotham in check ? It's through focussed violence and publicity of his fear. It's really simple to evade batman. Just have 2 bank robberies at the same time and you have beat him. If you can see past the two three incidents of violence, the catch being that India is a very large country and hence you will see atleast 2,3 cases everyday, you can find that India is just filled with people who just want to survive. The only way to do that is to get together and help each other, which is what the vacation was for. The growth story is for the people who understands the economics, this is going to be India's final growth story before reaching population peak. So there will be the largest push ever for gdp growth, before population and GDP kinda peaking. In this decade of growth, those who can find it can be rich, those who cannot do anything will be doomed. Shame, for thinking armed forces did this to their own"
