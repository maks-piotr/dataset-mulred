        "(Scroll down for TLDR)\n\nIMAO.. As it stands presently.. GLOBALLY Democracy is the biggest con now playing at a election near you.. \n\nThis unfunny farce is starring, produced, scripted and directed by the ruling elite capitalist classes who have a captive audience namely, the compliant masses.. \n\nBut on the other hand.. \n\nI dream of a future where democracy is rescued and resurrected by technology.. \n\nAfter all we should really be voting for and against POLICIES AND NOT POLITICIANS .. \n\nA new technology (just around the corner) can easily rid us of these useless middlemen ie. politicians who in theory have been democratically elected based on the policies that they have proposed for the betterment of the society.. But in reality are too busy pulling each other down while covering their own crimes.. \n\nOur current crop of power hungry politicians (and this is globally) operate just like the entitled tyrannical monarchs from history and rule over their fiefdoms (constituencies) like it is their own private backyard while regarding their subjects (the so called electorate) as nothing more than cannon fodder.. \n\nWhere were stand today, globally, democracy is a cruel joke.. Because.. Democracy ceases to function efficiently when the disparities within a society get out of control.. When the differences between the haves and have-nots between the knowledgeable and the ignorant are too much then the very ground on which we place our so called democratic values is rather nonexistent and therefore a total lie.. A farce.. Add rampant capitalism to this scenerio and we have a global society where we literally worship money so then we might as well make the richest person in the land our supreme leader.. Why do all this farce of free and fair elections..ðŸ¤”\n\nIdeally capitalist tendencies (the profit motive) should not be allowed to operate in atleast these 3 major \"industries\" namely 1. health care 2. education and 3. warfare.. But today in our rather twisted world we see the very same 3 sectors operating with the utmost greed, reaping ridiculous profits at the expense of perpetuating horrendous and inhumane social disparities.. All in the name of driving the so called \"economic growth\" of a so called \"nation\".. \n\nYet there is hope and I am betting on a humane technology to come to our rescue.. Because history repeats itself.. Whenever humanity has faced any crises it has always been our innovations ie. technologies which have rescued us time and again.. These technologies can only be invented by a new generation who first question and then reject the old values because they see the world in a different way.. This new generation is already here.. The tools namely AI, AGI are also available.. Now only the will and the skill to make sincere creative efforts are needed.. I hope that this happens in my lifetime.. .. First imagine a world without any \"career politicians\" .. Then imagine a world where every citizen is in effect a politician because they have the power to not only directly vote on each and every policy that stands to affect them.. But also propose any policy that they wish to come into governance.. That would be so cool.. \n\nHowever for now until then.. What to do.. Well in my personal capacity, the above reasons stand for the fact that I have stopped voting.. Because I want to boycott not just our corrupt politicians but the insidious system itself.. I reject this false democracy and farce called elections.. Yes I know that there is something called the NOTA vote.. But (in India) this NOTA is a toothless tiger ffs.. So the only option for me in my personal capacity is to boycott these mofoking farcical elections. \n\n\nTLDR.. Democracy breaks down when there is too much disparity in society because then this disparity is cunningly and cruelly leveraged by the corrupt politicians.. However with Technological advances there is hope that this system can be repaired.. After all we should BE VOTING FOR POLICIES AND NOT FOR POLITICIANS.. Technology can empower the electorate and finally make these middleman ie. politicians obsolete.. Computer ji pls help..",
