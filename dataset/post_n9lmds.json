        "Have been playing Jotun since months irregularly...finally reached the final boss. I keep dying!!\n\nEdit: I finished it!!!!",
        "Diablo 3 eternal edition on nintendo switch. I stopped playing D3 on PC after a few months when it first came out. The endgame was too boring. This switch version is awesome though. Insanely addictive too. Do give it a try if you like hack and slash RPGs with loot farming and gear minmaxing.",
        "Playing Death Stranding. Still just on the third chapter. Taking it real nice and slow.\n\nAlso playing Battlefield V on the side",
        "I am playing it too! The game’s amazing! After 4th chapter you’ll find yourself tackling BTs quite easily because of all the gear you’ll have!",
        "I'm already tackling BTs since the end of chapter 2 using Hematic grenades. The biggest bruh moment for me was that I had killed 3 mini BT bosses and I did not collect the chiral crystals they drop",
        "Started playing NFS Underground 2 again after a decade. Felt like a teenager again. What a game. The outdated graphics barely made a difference to me. The gameplay is really immersive. Thinking of playing all NFS classics again",
        "Played this in 2015. Amazing game and graphics. I personally find this as the best one in the franchise",
        "Legends of runeterra",
        "Horizon zero dawn, doom eternal and God of War GMGOW.",
        "Uncharted 4\n\nYesterday was the 5th anniversary so I thought I should start another playthrough",
        "Ghostrunner- It's such a fun game makes you wonder what developers could achieve if they were actually interested in the games they're making",
        "The customisation was next level for that time. I still remember the cool wallpapers as a kid when it first came out.",
        "I am just playing fifa now a days!!",
        "Completed horizon zero dawn \nThen I started dirt series.\nBut mostly playing Apex legends on daily basis.\nAnd somewhat Ghostrunner"
