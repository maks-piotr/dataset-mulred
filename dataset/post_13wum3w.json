    "selftext": "Hi. I booked Ola S1 pro scooter on 30th May through app and paid in full with credit card. Today when I see the app it shows I need to pay 15000 more to get the scooter delivered due to change in Government policy from June 1 2023. I don't know which government policy it is. I was not informed earlier either through the app or by ohe ola experience centre worker with whose help I booked it. These people just want to extort money and I am fed up of their schemes even before the scooter is delivered. I wanted to trust them but looking back at the reviews of disappointed customers, they were correct and I was wrong.\n\nI want to cancel my order. But I have heard horror stories of receiving refund after even 4 month. Meanwhile I would be required to pay a heft bill on my credit cards and the amount which I can't withdraw later. \n\nGuys, stay away. These people are not to be trusted. I even handed over my adhar and pan details to experience center worker to upload (Now I know completely moronic). Please don't fall in this trap. Willing to share order proof If any Ola executive requests.[Extra charge](https://i.postimg.cc/zvyJpgbw/Screenshot-2023-05-31-23-53-18-60.png)\n\nEdit: the ola experience centre dealer is saying he is working with ola office to give the option for earlier booked price now and that I will be given a choice if I want to pay extra 15 k or cancel the booking before scooter registration. \nPersonally I don't think it's feasible, and he is buying time. What should I do?\n\nEdit: the customer care number is unavailable on the sim with which I booked the scooter as it says the number I dialled is wrong. However my other number connects with customer care but no with representative as they say no booking found on this sim. Talk about fishy. Email is the only option. And yes I have talktime balance as well as unlimited recharge on both sim before anyone points that out.",

        "I booked on 30th May. The ola experience centre guy even told me that it was the last day with discounted price. Also the app was showing the same notification that today is last day with discounted price. Also I got an Sms from ola regarding the same. So in a rush I placed the order the same day. But it's very petty and dishonest for a mass market manufacturer to not disclose such important information beforehand and waiting till now the scooter is out for delivery from factory to customer so that he has no choice but to pay it.",
        "Yes, not denying that it's pretty dishonest. \n\nI don't think you should be paying.  I'm a S1 owner myself but won't stand with these ridiculous actions from the company.",

        "The FAME2 subsidy is being cut effective 1st June. The only way you would have been eligible for the old subsidy was if Ola had processed your purchase order and sent it for registration before 31st may. \n\nAther, I heard, is eating the difference if customer already paid the full amount but the company could not process registration prior to 31st May",
        "This is what happens when you blindly book a scooter like you're booking movie tickets.",
        "Yeah, I deserved it. Right?",
        "Yes. How can you make a purchase of 1 lakh + without knowing what comprises that cost, and especially the discounts involved?"
