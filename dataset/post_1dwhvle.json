        "Reviews look identical. Did they buy these reviews?",
        "So this is how drop a review and get paid 500 works, nice",
        "True, first half of the movie especially was so boring. I brought into the hype of the movie and spent 800 rupees on recliner seats. 🥲",
        "You guys are trusting Google reviews?",
        "KGF 1 have 8.2  IMDB \nSouth andhbhakt of actor did so much hardwork for increasing rating",
        "400 in my city XD",
        "I keep hearing that the Mahabharata scenes are amazing, was it worth it for that at least?",
        "PR companies are destroying the real talent",
        "Prabhas has serious dialogue delivery issues.",
        "Bro,,  didn't you see the trailer. It was clear from the trailer itself that it was a shitty movie. In the day and age when almost everyone has seen hollywood movies, what is the point in copy pasting parts from different movies and give a less than hollywood animation in it.",
        "Lol That's a scam. This works differently makers/fans pay a bot-farm lumpsum money to get these reviews. Fans of south actors do this regularly - random polls, increase engagement on released trailers and fight on who's a bigger star in twitter sometimes invite for physical confrontations. \n\nDon't trust any ratings on Amazon or Flipkart products too.",
        "Naaa, the length of those scenes were 5 mins",
        "imo, both are paid review scams",

        "Available on streaming?",
        "Maan finally someone who isn't hyping this piece of crap like it  was some benchmark movie in the country. Boring story, bad acting and non engaging. I seriously considered the theories of sunk cost from my undergrad econ days at interval, but then realised I am not posh enough to do that yet for 750 rupee movie ticket :(",
        "lol",
        "It's not a shitty movie at all! They tried a typical Indian mass masala film template in the first half. It was like an episode of \"What if Starlord was born in dystopian India\". But they really pushed the Indian standards in VFX and fight choreography in the second half. That itself makes it worth watching in the cinema. The blending of mythology and sci-fi was also fantastic.",
        "I encountered it on the release day, where I was hoping to check for google reviews and find myself all are copy pasted ones. They just review bombed it.",
        "Never again",
        "Only hakla can  make good movies",
        "250 in my city XD",
        "The movie was not the best but it was definitely not bad because the CGI was pretty good I say but well the acting and the opening fighting scene was downright horrendous. But after the interval it was pretty good . The VFX was better than we have ever seen in any Bollywood movie and talking about the copying the niches from Hollywood seems fine to me at least it was not a down right copy of the story. And at last who the fuck is paying 800 for a single ticket???",
        "You call this bul***it? The movie is getting love amd great word of mouth? Are you hating it because of involvement of hindu mythology? Like why would you call this bu***it when its clearly a step towards betterment of indian VFX. I find it great that they are blending mythology in cinema.\n\nIts clearly a movie you can enjoy. Unless you hate the idea of enjoying mythology pretaining to Hindu religion.",
        "Pirated and downloaded can agree with OP",
        "It was too long and should've been trimmed down to about 2 hours. I was desperate for it to end, and I am someone who generally loves long movies. Visuals and all were nice though",
        "what was boring in it?You have a weird opinion dude",
        "I mean the movie was okayish, I went with zero expectations.\n\nPacing is shit, but overall it was a nice attempt of vfx for the dystopian era.\n\nNot a bad movie, but is hella overhyped. And your bad take is just as exaggerated as the ones who hype it.",
        "The movie was good. You just have to watch the first 10 minutes, get some fresh air, and come back after the interval. That is how you can survive Prabhas' bad acting in the first half.",
        "I can't believe people actually think the movie was good?!!!",
        "Sasta CGI, Sasti Bollywood Crap Movie, Sasti Dune",
        "All the prabhas scenes in the first half were boring and really hurt the pacing.  I fell asleep during the second half so can't comment on it.",
        "Very surprised with the ratings ..",
        "brahmastra literally had far better VFC",
        "“Prabhas’s film” as though Prabhas wrote and directed the film. Directors and writers don’t get any respect in india",
        "Indians love bad movies. It's not a surprise",
        "Then we didn’t see the same movies. This movie is far far better than Brahmastra.",
        "Prabhas was the worst part of the movie\n\nCould have just not had his character and the movie would have been way better",
        "Brahmastra had good vfx, but a shit plotline definitely didn't help!",
        "The places are called click farms.. It’s bread butter from thousands of people .. 😂",
        "Right? Imagine people having different opinions to you. I just can't believe it. How can anyone have different opinion than you (the lord of ultimate opinions)",
        "Brahmastra also had worse storyline, dialogs.",
        "Idk about that guys but lots of states have price caps on movie tickets. Best shiz ever",
        "People might be comparing it with AAAdhipurush.  \n\n😂",
        "I recently saw the Hindi Version and iyts literally a Tatti film, No Story , nothing..They just keep fighting..People in central india like MP, CG dont like all this stuff..We want movies in Bollywood back like Razzi, Special 26, A wednesday etc...WHat is this fucking south Nonsense",
        "Weakest link of movie was prabhas.",
        "One of the worst movies in recent times. Reminded me of SRK’s Jawan. Don’t know how I sat in the theatre throughout the full length of the movie. The VFX was pretty cool though.",
        "I do applaud the creators for even attempting something like this and the vfx was pretty good too.\n\nWould have been a great movie if it didn't have the usual masala of hero worship and unfunny jokes.",
        "Even imdb shows 8/10",
        "I watched it yesterday, went it in completely blind. Thought it would be some kind of action movie like Bahubali and that it had 7.9/10 on IMDB. \n\nThere were no subtitles even though it was literally said that subtitles are present, I couldn't understand most of what they were speaking.  I don't want to comment on anything religious but most of the audience was pretty bored, I could see plenty of phones & people reading their messages during action scenes. \n\nCGI was pretty good but there was too much of it and no plot to back it up. No character development either, the story was pretty confusing and the characters had too much plot-armor.\n\nAlso for a 5000 unit bounty, there were countless hunters so obviously 5000 units is a lot for them but for a 5 million unit bounty (Maa) it was the just complex guards and that chapri looking guy (who didn't even die), and as stated by the AI only 4 teams were en route.",
        "Lmao , It's just  hard for me to digest that people were liking the movie. I watched and just felt like a waste of money for me. good for those who liked the movie lol.",
        "What other explanation can you think of?",
        "Cannot stress this enough!",
        "The first half was 🥱\nBut the second half is much better\n\nPeople comparing Brahmastra with Kalki forget that the story build up in Brahmastra was shitty nevertheless. Kalki has built a dystopian world with inculcating characters from Mahabharat in a much superior way, waiting for the next part to see who is actual Kalki.",
        "Had me in the first half, oh nvm",
        "I am in the opinion of it being somewhere in the middle of what some people are saying(absolute best) and what other people are saying(waste of money). I felt like it was a good watch. There are so many terrible scenes but equally good ones too. Amitabh killed, scenes from Epic were crazy good. I hope they reduce the use of Hinglish in the next movie.",
        "lol if movie flops or any controversies happens people will always abuse actors not the director writers etc lol some indians are literally dumb",
        "Such a crap movie ..I was just waiting for Amitabh's scenes other scenes are just crap..opening was really good..but once I saw prabhas acting, man I knew he is going to do shit acting in this movie too..kinda felt cringe watching him do lame comedy..man really fell hard after bahubali...",
        "Bruh, in this age of ai, why copy paste the same shit \n\nJust use gpt, Gemini etc",
        "Prabhas' latest film, \"Kalki,\" is nothing short of a cinematic marvel that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling. This epic saga, directed by the visionary filmmaker Nag Ashwin, masterfully blends mythology, action, and drama to create a mesmerizing experience for audiences.\n\nFrom the moment the film begins, it captivates with its stunning visuals and intricate set designs, transporting viewers into a world where ancient legends and modern aesthetics seamlessly converge. The attention to detail in the production design is commendable, showcasing the meticulous efforts of the entire creative team.\n\nPrabhas, in the titular role of Kalki, delivers a performance that is both powerful and nuanced. His portrayal of the mythological hero is imbued with a sense of grandeur and gravitas that makes every scene he is in truly unforgettable. The physical transformation he underwent for the role is remarkable, adding a layer of authenticity to his character.\n\nThe supporting cast, including leading lady Deepika Padukone, also shines brightly. Deepika’s portrayal of her character brings depth and emotional resonance to the narrative, providing a perfect counterbalance to Prabhas' intensity. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and adds a layer of romantic allure to the epic tale.\n\nThe screenplay of \"Kalki\" is another standout element, weaving together complex themes of good versus evil, destiny, and redemption. The dialogues are both profound and poetic, reflecting the film's mythological roots while remaining accessible to contemporary audiences.\n\nOne cannot overlook the film’s breathtaking action sequences, choreographed with precision and flair. These scenes are not just visually spectacular but also integral to the storytelling, enhancing the overall impact of the narrative. The use of cutting-edge visual effects further elevates the film, making the mythical elements come alive on screen.\n\nThe musical score by A. R. Rahman is nothing short of a masterpiece. His compositions perfectly complement the film's tone, enhancing the emotional and dramatic beats of the story. Each track resonates with the audience, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Kalki\" is an extraordinary film that showcases the best of Indian cinema. It is a testament to the talent and dedication of everyone involved in its creation, from the cast and crew to the production team. Prabhas has once again proven why he is one of the most revered actors in the industry, delivering a performance that will be remembered for years to come. \"Kalki\" is not just a movie; it is an experience that should not be missed.",
        "i agree , they should reduce hinglish and just use hindi  , its annoying",
        "I can already tell how this movie is going to be without watching the movie",
        "No doubt it had good VFX but compare the elements of VFX used in movie, kalki has far more  intense use of VFX that is executed almost perfectly especially for a Bollywood movie. The quality is actually insane and can be compared to Hollywood sci-fi movies",
        "For me this movie was 7/10\n\nAmitabh Bachchan was 20/10, seriously I couldn't believe his performance. Straight up Ace. \n\nPrabhas look was disappointing. His puffed eyes and face with warrior armour was not going well together. He should have worked on himself. \n\nEver since Bahubali, he has not looked the same. At least for movies as big as this one, he can shred some fat to look according to his role. \n\nFor me Prabhas was 4/10\n\nDeepika was 10/10\n\nKamal Hasan 20/10 may be better then Amitabh but his screen time was less. \n\nIn starting there was useless action for the intro of Prabhas. \n\nDisha Patni, why was she even there ? Baby oil on his stomach to showcase abs, common we are not here for that.",
        "Everything but prabhas was good. AB definitely carried the movie. The world around them was interesting. VFX is very good for an Indian movie. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it rewatchable? Not really. I’ll probably wait for the OTT release of the sequel.",
        "Okay here's the thing, the VFX for the movie was done by DNEG which is literally an Oscar winning VFX company and behind a lot of recent Nolan films including Interstellar and tenet. That's why I spent 750 rupees to watch this boring ass movie.\n\nAlso the last indian VFX film I saw was ra one so I will admit the VFX here was around ahead, but it wasn't something next level and also the reason I said it wasn't an Indian benchmark movie was because you bought out a big foreign company, it's not like we developed those capabilities in house and then the expectations are obviously going to be similar to what you expect of DNEG normally. \n\nThe VFX here wasn't even on par with the worst VFX MCU movies like black widow and eternals. Now we can think it's progress that we are atleast in the same convo as MCU or realize that , that's the basic expected standard when you buy out an Oscar winning studio.\n\nBarring VFX, the acting was cringe and the story progression was a snooze fest",
        "Yup i agree with you, I wasn't a fan of the trailer, it looked like a DUNE Parody. \n\nBut the opening 10 minutes, thought provoking intro.\n\nThen the 1st half was BS, i am not a fan of Prabhas screen presence. 2nd half was good as it has action scenes, and i really liked Amitabh Bachchan's role.\n\nSummary: better storyline than Brahmastra, miss the 1st half and you won't be missing anything lol.",
        "Man Frfr even disha acted better than prabhas",
        "I ain't an actor(just gave a few stage performances in school) but can still do better than Prabhas",
        "Aadhipurush?",
        "Shiva shiva shiva",
        "Damn didn't know the vfx thing. Makes sense why it is way better than any other Indian movie.\n\nWell I'm gonna be optimistic that the creators listen to criticism and make a more slick and serious movie for the next instalment.",
        "The apocalyptic setting was a straight up copy from battle angel alita \n\nA floating city for rich people\n1 mil unit requirement to reach there\nBounty hunter system \n\nThese were straight up copied without giving a thought",
        "At least Disha had something to show lmao when they started to swim",
        "😂",
        "It's not that bad, 3 or 3.5 /5  , could have been much better",

        "Gonna blow your mind more...DNEG was behind bladerunner 2047 as well",
        "Only b grade sci-fi's tho",
        "I went to watch this movie yesterday. I left the theatre after 40 minutes the movie started. Those 40 minutes apart from the initial Mahabharat scenes were slow as fuck. They tried hyping Prabhas’ entry as some big event but it was shit. The action sequence which followed could not be even saved by Diljit Dosanjh’s energetic song. That’s when I left. Overdrawn action sequence which was not even enjoyable had me. \n\nMakers should learn from how a proper superstar is presented from maybe how SRK was introduced in Pathaan or RK’s entry in Animal.\n\nPrabhas doesn’t know how to act. \n\nBut credit where credit’s due his fans are super loyal and this movie will earn 1000 crores easily in two weeks. At the end that’s the metric which movie makers are chasing.",
        "Greta setting, world, concept. Terrible acting by Prabhas, guy had no screen presence at all. Too many things felt like a simple copy, and tropes were nothing new. \n\nWas excited for a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk-esque rendition in India but it was disappointing. Movie in my opinion was brought down by the stupid pacing and unnecessary “funny” dialogues and scripts which are a characteristic of Indian cinema. ",

I'm not saying he's a bad person or a bad actor, but the fact that he only acts in ultra-high-budget movies after Bahubali even after so many failures proves that he's still riding that wave. Of course, Rajamouli doesn't need any recognition from the likes of Prabhas but Prabhas definitely gained a lot of popularity only and only because of Rajamouli. Just remove the popularity he gained from Bahubali from the list of his movies and all his PAN INDIA movies released after that would be an instant flop (most of them already were), assuming he would be even considered for those roles.",
        "Why do you think rajamouli went with Prabhas? Prabhas suits most of the larger than life roles written for commercial movies. He  would be in most of the movies even not for bahubali ,  atleast for salaar , kalki and upcoming spirit . Directors like nag Ashwin and vanga had been approaching prabhas from long time .\nAnd career getting push by a hit movie is common phenomenon. \nFir example Salmans golden run during 2010s was started by wanted , before which he had string of flops",
        "My Telugu friend was hyping it so much. She was telling me Nag Ashwin is such a good director. I mean he might be but direction of this movie was so bad. It was like a children's movie just remove the violence. It wanted to like it, it was such a good concept but it came out so boring "

    "light_cleaned_comments": "Reviews look identical. Did they buy these reviews? So this is how drop a review and get paid 500 works, nice True, first half of the movie especially was so boring. I brought into the hype of the movie and spent 800 rupees on recliner seats. 🥲 You guys are trusting Google reviews? KGF 1 have 8.2 IMDB South andhbhakt of actor did so much hardwork for increasing rating 400 in my city XD I keep hearing that the Mahabharata scenes are amazing, was it worth it for that at least? PR companies are destroying the real talent Prabhas has serious dialogue delivery issues. Bro,, didn't you see the trailer. It was clear from the trailer itself that it was a shitty movie. In the day and age when almost everyone has seen hollywood movies, what is the point in copy pasting parts from different movies and give a less than hollywood animation in it. Lol That's a scam. This works differently makers/fans pay a bot-farm lumpsum money to get these reviews. Fans of south actors do this regularly - random polls, increase engagement on released trailers and fight on who's a bigger star in twitter sometimes invite for physical confrontations. Don't trust any ratings on Amazon or Flipkart products too. Naaa, the length of those scenes were 5 mins imo, both are paid review scams pr in the time of ai Always use letterboxd for getting movie ratings Is it possible to learn this power? Real id se ao modi ji Movie is actually preety fine and review buying ain't a new thing Available on streaming? Maan finally someone who isn't hyping this piece of crap like it was some benchmark movie in the country. Boring story, bad acting and non engaging. I seriously considered the theories of sunk cost from my undergrad econ days at interval, but then realised I am not posh enough to do that yet for 750 rupee movie ticket :( lol It's not a shitty movie at all! They tried a typical Indian mass masala film template in the first half. It was like an episode of \"What if Starlord was born in dystopian India\". But they really pushed the Indian standards in VFX and fight choreography in the second half. That itself makes it worth watching in the cinema. The blending of mythology and sci-fi was also fantastic. I encountered it on the release day, where I was hoping to check for google reviews and find myself all are copy pasted ones. They just review bombed it. Never again Only hakla can make good movies 250 in my city XD The movie was not the best but it was definitely not bad because the CGI was pretty good I say but well the acting and the opening fighting scene was downright horrendous. But after the interval it was pretty good . The VFX was better than we have ever seen in any Bollywood movie and talking about the copying the niches from Hollywood seems fine to me at least it was not a down right copy of the story. And at last who the fuck is paying 800 for a single ticket??? You call this bul***it? The movie is getting love amd great word of mouth? Are you hating it because of involvement of hindu mythology? Like why would you call this bu***it when its clearly a step towards betterment of indian VFX. I find it great that they are blending mythology in cinema. Its clearly a movie you can enjoy. Unless you hate the idea of enjoying mythology pretaining to Hindu religion. Pirated and downloaded can agree with OP It was too long and should've been trimmed down to about 2 hours. I was desperate for it to end, and I am someone who generally loves long movies. Visuals and all were nice though what was boring in it?You have a weird opinion dude I mean the movie was okayish, I went with zero expectations. Pacing is shit, but overall it was a nice attempt of vfx for the dystopian era. Not a bad movie, but is hella overhyped. And your bad take is just as exaggerated as the ones who hype it. The movie was good. You just have to watch the first 10 minutes, get some fresh air, and come back after the interval. That is how you can survive Prabhas' bad acting in the first half. I can't believe people actually think the movie was good?!!! Sasta CGI, Sasti Bollywood Crap Movie, Sasti Dune All the prabhas scenes in the first half were boring and really hurt the pacing. I fell asleep during the second half so can't comment on it. Very surprised with the ratings .. brahmastra literally had far better VFC “Prabhas’s film” as though Prabhas wrote and directed the film. Directors and writers don’t get any respect in india Indians love bad movies. It's not a surprise Then we didn’t see the same movies. This movie is far far better than Brahmastra. Prabhas was the worst part of the movie Could have just not had his character and the movie would have been way better Brahmastra had good vfx, but a shit plotline definitely didn't help! The places are called click farms.. It’s bread butter from thousands of people .. 😂 Right? Imagine people having different opinions to you. I just can't believe it. How can anyone have different opinion than you (the lord of ultimate opinions) Brahmastra also had worse storyline, dialogs. Idk about that guys but lots of states have price caps on movie tickets. Best shiz ever People might be comparing it with AAAdhipurush. 😂 I recently saw the Hindi Version and iyts literally a Tatti film, No Story , nothing..They just keep fighting..People in central india like MP, CG dont like all this stuff..We want movies in Bollywood back like Razzi, Special 26, A wednesday etc...WHat is this fucking south Nonsense Weakest link of movie was prabhas. One of the worst movies in recent times. Reminded me of SRK’s Jawan. Don’t know how I sat in the theatre throughout the full length of the movie. The VFX was pretty cool though. I do applaud the creators for even attempting something like this and the vfx was pretty good too. Would have been a great movie if it didn't have the usual masala of hero worship and unfunny jokes. Even imdb shows 8/10 I watched it yesterday, went it in completely blind. Thought it would be some kind of action movie like Bahubali and that it had 7.9/10 on IMDB. There were no subtitles even though it was literally said that subtitles are present, I couldn't understand most of what they were speaking. I don't want to comment on anything religious but most of the audience was pretty bored, I could see plenty of phones & people reading their messages during action scenes. CGI was pretty good but there was too much of it and no plot to back it up. No character development either, the story was pretty confusing and the characters had too much plot-armor. Also for a 5000 unit bounty, there were countless hunters so obviously 5000 units is a lot for them but for a 5 million unit bounty (Maa) it was the just complex guards and that chapri looking guy (who didn't even die), and as stated by the AI only 4 teams were en route. Lmao , It's just hard for me to digest that people were liking the movie. I watched and just felt like a waste of money for me. good for those who liked the movie lol. What other explanation can you think of? Cannot stress this enough! The first half was 🥱 But the second half is much better People comparing Brahmastra with Kalki forget that the story build up in Brahmastra was shitty nevertheless. Kalki has built a dystopian world with inculcating characters from Mahabharat in a much superior way, waiting for the next part to see who is actual Kalki. Had me in the first half, oh nvm I am in the opinion of it being somewhere in the middle of what some people are saying(absolute best) and what other people are saying(waste of money). I felt like it was a good watch. There are so many terrible scenes but equally good ones too. Amitabh killed, scenes from Epic were crazy good. I hope they reduce the use of Hinglish in the next movie. lol if movie flops or any controversies happens people will always abuse actors not the director writers etc lol some indians are literally dumb Such a crap movie ..I was just waiting for Amitabh's scenes other scenes are just crap..opening was really good..but once I saw prabhas acting, man I knew he is going to do shit acting in this movie too..kinda felt cringe watching him do lame comedy..man really fell hard after bahubali... Bruh, in this age of ai, why copy paste the same shit Just use gpt, Gemini etc Prabhas' latest film, \"Kalki,\" is nothing short of a cinematic marvel that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling. This epic saga, directed by the visionary filmmaker Nag Ashwin, masterfully blends mythology, action, and drama to create a mesmerizing experience for audiences. From the moment the film begins, it captivates with its stunning visuals and intricate set designs, transporting viewers into a world where ancient legends and modern aesthetics seamlessly converge. The attention to detail in the production design is commendable, showcasing the meticulous efforts of the entire creative team. Prabhas, in the titular role of Kalki, delivers a performance that is both powerful and nuanced. His portrayal of the mythological hero is imbued with a sense of grandeur and gravitas that makes every scene he is in truly unforgettable. The physical transformation he underwent for the role is remarkable, adding a layer of authenticity to his character. The supporting cast, including leading lady Deepika Padukone, also shines brightly. Deepika’s portrayal of her character brings depth and emotional resonance to the narrative, providing a perfect counterbalance to Prabhas' intensity. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and adds a layer of romantic allure to the epic tale. The screenplay of \"Kalki\" is another standout element, weaving together complex themes of good versus evil, destiny, and redemption. The dialogues are both profound and poetic, reflecting the film's mythological roots while remaining accessible to contemporary audiences. One cannot overlook the film’s breathtaking action sequences, choreographed with precision and flair. These scenes are not just visually spectacular but also integral to the storytelling, enhancing the overall impact of the narrative. The use of cutting-edge visual effects further elevates the film, making the mythical elements come alive on screen. The musical score by A. R. Rahman is nothing short of a masterpiece. His compositions perfectly complement the film's tone, enhancing the emotional and dramatic beats of the story. Each track resonates with the audience, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll. In conclusion, \"Kalki\" is an extraordinary film that showcases the best of Indian cinema. It is a testament to the talent and dedication of everyone involved in its creation, from the cast and crew to the production team. Prabhas has once again proven why he is one of the most revered actors in the industry, delivering a performance that will be remembered for years to come. \"Kalki\" is not just a movie; it is an experience that should not be missed. i agree , they should reduce hinglish and just use hindi , its annoying I can already tell how this movie is going to be without watching the movie No doubt it had good VFX but compare the elements of VFX used in movie, kalki has far more intense use of VFX that is executed almost perfectly especially for a Bollywood movie. The quality is actually insane and can be compared to Hollywood sci-fi movies For me this movie was 7/10 Amitabh Bachchan was 20/10, seriously I couldn't believe his performance. Straight up Ace. Prabhas look was disappointing. His puffed eyes and face with warrior armour was not going well together. He should have worked on himself. Ever since Bahubali, he has not looked the same. At least for movies as big as this one, he can shred some fat to look according to his role. For me Prabhas was 4/10 Deepika was 10/10 Kamal Hasan 20/10 may be better then Amitabh but his screen time was less. In starting there was useless action for the intro of Prabhas. Disha Patni, why was she even there ? Baby oil on his stomach to showcase abs, common we are not here for that. Everything but prabhas was good. AB definitely carried the movie. The world around them was interesting. VFX is very good for an Indian movie. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it rewatchable? Not really. I’ll probably wait for the OTT release of the sequel. Okay here's the thing, the VFX for the movie was done by DNEG which is literally an Oscar winning VFX company and behind a lot of recent Nolan films including Interstellar and tenet. That's why I spent 750 rupees to watch this boring ass movie. Also the last indian VFX film I saw was ra one so I will admit the VFX here was around ahead, but it wasn't something next level and also the reason I said it wasn't an Indian benchmark movie was because you bought out a big foreign company, it's not like we developed those capabilities in house and then the expectations are obviously going to be similar to what you expect of DNEG normally. The VFX here wasn't even on par with the worst VFX MCU movies like black widow and eternals. Now we can think it's progress that we are atleast in the same convo as MCU or realize that , that's the basic expected standard when you buy out an Oscar winning studio. Barring VFX, the acting was cringe and the story progression was a snooze fest Yup i agree with you, I wasn't a fan of the trailer, it looked like a DUNE Parody. But the opening 10 minutes, thought provoking intro. Then the 1st half was BS, i am not a fan of Prabhas screen presence. 2nd half was good as it has action scenes, and i really liked Amitabh Bachchan's role. Summary: better storyline than Brahmastra, miss the 1st half and you won't be missing anything lol. Man Frfr even disha acted better than prabhas I ain't an actor(just gave a few stage performances in school) but can still do better than Prabhas Aadhipurush? Shiva shiva shiva Damn didn't know the vfx thing. Makes sense why it is way better than any other Indian movie. Well I'm gonna be optimistic that the creators listen to criticism and make a more slick and serious movie for the next instalment. The apocalyptic setting was a straight up copy from battle angel alita A floating city for rich people 1 mil unit requirement to reach there Bounty hunter system These were straight up copied without giving a thought At least Disha had something to show lmao when they started to swim 😂 It's not that bad, 3 or 3.5 /5 , could have been much better Prabhas' latest film, \"Kalki,\" is nothing short of a cinematic marvel that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling.

Gonna blow your mind more...DNEG was behind bladerunner 2047 as well Only b grade sci-fi's tho I went to watch this movie yesterday. I left the theatre after 40 minutes the movie started. Those 40 minutes apart from the initial Mahabharat scenes were slow as fuck. They tried hyping Prabhas’ entry as some big event but it was shit. The action sequence which followed could not be even saved by Diljit Dosanjh’s energetic song. That’s when I left. Overdrawn action sequence which was not even enjoyable had me. Makers should learn from how a proper superstar is presented from maybe how SRK was introduced in Pathaan or RK’s entry in Animal. Prabhas doesn’t know how to act. But credit where credit’s due his fans are super loyal and this movie will earn 1000 crores easily in two weeks. At the end that’s the metric which movie makers are chasing. Greta setting, world, concept. Terrible acting by Prabhas, guy had no screen presence at all. Too many things felt like a simple copy, and tropes were nothing new. Was excited for a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk-esque rendition in India but it was disappointing. Movie in my opinion was brought down by the stupid pacing and unnecessary “funny” dialogues and scripts which are a characteristic of Indian cinema. *It's an tollywood movie not an bollywood I mean movie choices are subjective, but bollywood and tollywood ne sabka objectively bad taste krwa diya hai Have you guys seen Kalki? I’ve heard it’s nothing short of a cinematic marvel that transcends boundaries to conventional storytelling Hahahahahahaha.. You concentrated enough to find the plotholes ? Why is every review the same? Leavs them brother They are calling tollywood movie as bollywood now They are just filled with jealousness That’s the scam. Paid reviews \"Entire south film industry comes to support\" Lmao okay scammers. Is it a family film? Mummy papa ko leke ja sakte hain? Oh no, in fact saw Google reviews yesterday & was thinking of going, that didn't work out, so was thinking maybe next Friday Not reliable, hijacked by movie makers now a days. That's true ngl, they have been constantly releasing garbage content that any mediocre film becomes good for them. Yes, if you want to torture them for 3 hrs straight. Amitabh Bachchan is in it. What do you think? Please think never Ha exactly, decent movies ka bar low ho gaya hai india me I wrote this on another movie sub and South Star bhakt attacked me like hell so I had to delete it. Character writing had no depth.. but maybe the makers want to establish that in upcoming films. However, only this movie is in front of us, only Bachchan's character and his portrayal really worked otherwise as audience performances and character writing was so bad, it plummeted the narration. Also, we hardly learn anything about the universe.. as compared to say Harry Potter Philosopher's stone which was a lot more informative and compelling indian are kinda ruining imdb, they see any average film and rate it like fucking godfather. the imdb rating of 12th fail is 8.9 , anyone with good movie knowledge would nt rate it above 7, me personally i would give it a 6 You meant Blade runner 2049 Cant agree more. And they use botted comments to elevate their movie which looks like a cop-paste of StarWars Yup sorry typo I watched it with low expectations and honestly it wasn't nad at all. The start is a bit slow but it really picks up around the interval. Best CGI I have seen in a Bollywood movie such a good movie It's shit a* Yeah ikr..bollywood has only 1 or 2 good movies this year..These guys Suck at making movies rn and they are jealous Most probably just over enthusiastic fans copy pasting reviews mixed in with bot activity Yes bhaiya literally calling an tollywood movie as bollywood Itna jealousy acha nahi hota Most of them are ai generated. I went to the theatre....tbh prabhas was shit in the movie.....but I knew that beforehand....but I still went ...because I liked the role Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Hasan....and I'm not disappointed...they really gave their best Rabid and blind fans who copied an eloquent review? But they kinda shot themselves in the foot by trying to show so much futuristic stuff, VFX was good but when you need VFX for every scene there will be cracks. We have ruined the movie rating system just like everything else Never check the audience ratings, that includes the IMDb. Always check the critics ratings. my favourite part of the movie was srk’s cameo😍😍 if you don't read Mahabharata, then you don't understand the meaning of this movie coz it's based on Hindu mythological book KALKI PURAN & MAHABHARATA. firstly read Mahabharata know the characters and understand the \"geeta gyan\" then i can bet you will love the movie. 1. It was not a bull\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ movie. 2. These fake/paid reviews are indeed bull\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and started coming in even BEFORE the film released. It had hundreds of reviews before the official release. 3. Why do our people treat everything like an opportunity to scam? Every system as something they can manipulate? 4. Why are we offended by criticism so much that we have to shout/drown it out whether it's a politician, a film, a culture, anything at all?? India now has a major reputation for gaming IMDb reviews and it's embarrassing on the world stage! Google reviews is the next casualty. The trailer looked like shit. I wouldn't trust anyone, not even IMDB. Seeing is believing. Worst mistake was to watch Spiderman No way home in Imax. Wasted 640 rupees. Could have had 2 biryani instead. Then why are people hyping it so much ? Are we glorifying the mediocre contents ? Eagerly waiting for a post like this. If you don't compare it to Hollywood movies...it was a good movie They were really good, if they made a complete Mahabharat movie with scenes like that it would be great. But in this movie there were only 3-4 scenes, so not worth it just for that. Looks like chatgpt was used lol I love apocalyptic movie and found the movie decent enough. Off course it’s not in the same league as Dune, mad max but it’s a good attempt for Indian movie industry. My opinion may also be biased because I paid 349 to watch 4 movies ! True, the hero worship and typical masala ruined a really good story. People who have seen, Hollywood sci fi flicks won't like this I have also watched the movie and it's pretty bad 😭 No 12th fail deserves a 8 Yeah that guy also must be cursed to be immortal because how else do you survive a direct explosion to your face xd OP butt hurt, but fake reviews is bad, but op is really butt hurt. Well, I didn't get paid anything. Am gonna shit in their review box. Request for all to do the same. Cntrl C + Cntrl V review.........gongurawood always ahead 69 😛💦 (this comment in so stupid. lmao same sax sux jokes) True, no respect for writers and directors in this country. If people didn't think of Bahubali as a \"Prabhas's film\", I doubt he would be getting so many roles in such high-budget movies even after numerous failures. Clearly, it was SS Rajamouli who made that movie special but Prabhas is still riding on its success and getting roles because of it, but his last few movies have proved his presence had very little to do with Bahubali's success. Kalki is actually good when it comes to story line and so many hints of Mahabharata i loved the movie and yes nothing is perfect there are flaws but it can be ignored Chatgpt hard at work, I see. If you look closely, the VFX are very poor quality. You’ll see pixelations. And most of these are reused assets from Marvel movies, they had just changed the colours. But yes! The movie does get better in the second half. Meri ek tang nakli hai, mai hockey ka bohot bada khiladi tha energy How DARE you judge our lord PRABOSS film All indian movies have inflated reviews, because they are reviewed by Bollywood fanboys Hollywood's dystopian sci-fi movies seriously think about possible future of human kind , but this movie seriously thinking about Hinduism epics Hahaha This is most out of place movie I have seen. First half was just time stretching. Prabhas entry and that stupid fight sequence and god that awful background music now and then Bro wtf. Brahmastra cannot be a standard for indian films. It literally hit rock bottom and then some more. Yeah. They are ones behind Top Gun Maverick and Fighter. The difference in quality is stark. The problem comes from the fact that Indian producers don’t have the know how or the patience for a better VFX pipeline. The editing is bad in this movie. One scene prabhas destroys a ramp, and that same ramp is visible in all other scenes, unbroken. For a 600 crore movie, these things are unacceptable. turning hindu mythology into an action movie will just never work turning it into comics like amar chitra katha is the best As a true gamer i can for sure say scene by scene from where they took the idea, anyway dont wanna ruin my golden game memories so no gonna watch 😇 >ones behind Top Gun Maverick Fuck really?? This is a real blemish on DNEGs portfolio then tbh >The editing is bad in this movie. One scene prabhas destroys a ramp, and that same ramp is visible in all other scenes, unbroken. XD, I will be honest I was so disinterested in the movie by about the first 20 mins I didn't even focus on dialogues leave alone continuity fuckups Not even that bad movie. Prabhas terrible but movie worth going for Amitabh, Mahabharat Scenes and VFX. Finally! Someone said it. It's an unwatchable movie with a good starcast. (Except for prabhas ofc) And idk who said antics of Prabhas is cute. 150 for 2d and 200 for 3d in my city Letterboxd has even worse reviews. They're jokes and actor/actress thirsttraps. For those who doubt Prabhas' acting skills: Bahubali, an industry-defining hit, raised his expectations sky-high. Even before the world discovered Bahubali, Prabhas was already a gem in the Telugu film industry. As for Kalki, despite its flaws, walking out of the theater after witnessing those breathtaking visuals with the masterful blend of mythology, our history, our culture and sci-fi, one can't help but feel immense pride. This is Indian cinema meeting Hollywood standards on a 600cr budget. Yes, the movie has its imperfections, but it's all about perspective. Do you see the glass half empty or half FULL? Bhai log main abhi jaa raha hai dekhne. Vfx dekh ke aaunga. Nah. This blemish hardly counts because of all the other great work they have on their portfolio. They have been a part of, in some capacity, of all major blockbusters since last 2010s. Also, I think I maybe mistaken about their work on Top Gun, but Fighter I am sure of. The only good thing in the movie were Amitabh and the climax portion. Even then the climax was decent at best but hyped to the extreme. That's because you watched a dub he didn't do! You telling me that dance sequence in the complex wasn't a masterpiece from Prabhas /s Dude go and watch with family. It's not a perfect movie but it's quite good . People these days either give hyper postive or hyper negative reviews. Do watch it in 2d though , 3d is not worth it The dialogues were really really bad, I watched it in Hindi; so I assumed the dubbing is bad. Maybe my South Indian friends can comment on the native versions of the film. This happens for all movies. Are we really this dumb to believe it only happened with Kalki? Why does this deserve a separate post? I’d give godfather a 6 It is your fault to depend upon Google reviews. All review systems are flawed by bots and spammers. Coming to the Kalki. That movie is targeted towards kids. It has to be that way. What else do you expect? It was fun seeing Prabhas doing comedy in Telugu after Darling So enjoyed the world building in 1st half I cannot wait for Corridor Crew’s reaction to their VFX. They have reacted to almost all major Bollywood VFX films and it’s so much fun to watch. Surprisingly, they keep quoting a lot of that shah rukh khan movie where he ends up on Mars? Yeah good for ya The most costliest ticket in the best single screen in Hyderabad costs 250 and that is after they got a govt order to increase ticket rates by 75 Rs for the first 8 days of the movie release. People be buying 800 for a movie in the best theatres/seats with 0 vibe and excitement and be hoping for movie to be great. For 800 rupees no movie would be good enough to get a ROI 🤣 One should experience themselves for it to trust, is the current age. No one thought bahubali as Prabhass film . Rajamouli is much bigger brand already and you could see that with his next movie rrr. Prabhas is one of the most likeable stars and is very great person to work with . Also very hardworking , rarely takes breaks . It was because of him they could bankroll this project. Plus he gets huge numbers and post bahubali his movies not being good are due to bad execution. Also he had lot of health issues *yuor for recliner? He himself dubbed the movie in Hindi. Yeah idk why it had to have so much mythology... Controversial ik but I just wanted to see blade runner 2049 but set in india... What im saying… If people praise poor work, theyre gonna keep getting the same quality. Why not just call it what it is and hope they make the next instalment better quality? Sometimes i don’t understand Indian audience, how can you not have any standards Lol where did i say it is a standard. I compared those 2 cause they belong in the same genres. We have to call bs, BS. My post has been deleted from this and Mumbai subReddit, but my work here is done it seems Cheers! No Ikrr 🫨😭😂 You are kidding, right? I don't remember using /s in my reply, so no I'm using reddit while sitting in the movie hall watching kalki. Hmm Oh, your Bangalore Haydrabad guy, I understand. Bhaiya ek shehar k naam toh sahi likh dete But thik h , thanks for understanding So that’s the reason for hate ? It’s just part 1 let’s see what other parts have in them . People won’t accept complete dystopian movie. India is not the market for it so the makers have mixed past with the future This shows what Indians love. And this is what they get. I too got heavily downvoted on a post that I had to delete it KALKI review| Why would I never watch KALKI 2898 AD | # kalki 2898Ad #kalki2898adreview Real Analysis and review You, me, some educated or privileged people, or some local crowd could say this, but ask an average Indian who's not that educated or privileged, they wouldn't even know who Rajamouli is but they'd definitely know Prabhas was the \"Hero\" in Bahubali and Adipurush. I'm not saying he's a bad person or a bad actor, but the fact that he only acts in ultra-high-budget movies after Bahubali even after so many failures proves that he's still riding that wave. Of course, Rajamouli doesn't need any recognition from the likes of Prabhas but Prabhas definitely gained a lot of popularity only and only because of Rajamouli. Just remove the popularity he gained from Bahubali from the list of his movies and all his PAN INDIA movies released after that would be an instant flop (most of them already were), assuming he would be even considered for those roles. Why do you think rajamouli went with Prabhas? Prabhas suits most of the larger than life roles written for commercial movies. He would be in most of the movies even not for bahubali , atleast for salaar , kalki and upcoming spirit . Directors like nag Ashwin and vanga had been approaching prabhas from long time . And career getting push by a hit movie is common phenomenon. Fir example Salmans golden run during 2010s was started by wanted , before which he had string of flops My Telugu friend was hyping it so much. She was telling me Nag Ashwin is such a good director. I mean he might be but direction of this movie was so bad. It was like a children's movie just remove the violence. It wanted to like it, it was such a good concept but it came out so boring"
