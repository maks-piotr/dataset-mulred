We decided to put this theory to the test and analyzed over 1.8 million online dating interactions in the United Kingdom to discover the likelihood of users to contact other users based on race. We’ll let the results speak for themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7ih2mu2va8b1.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d351e65be9c4ef4459f98ebad81ab33a01017a0b\n\nThe data showed that Indian men AND Latina women were the ethnicity most preferred by the opposite sex.\n\nWhite men were 5.2% more likely to contact a woman if she was not White.\n\nBlack women are 9% more likely to click on a non-Black man than a Black man.\n\nThis is contrary to what we saw in the US where Black women were 3 times more likely to contact a Black man.\n\nAdditionally, Black men are 16% more likely to contact a non-Black woman than a Black woman.\n\nAsian and Latina women are the only female groups to prefer their same ethnicity.\n\nIt’s apparent that online daters in the United Kingdom prefer to date outside of their own ethnicity. This trend is also true for the United States — across the pond, U.S. daters most preferred Asian women, except for Asian men. Talk about shocking!",

I don't blame the current English gen for anything, the sins of the father are not of the son, but you guys not acknowledging any wrong was done is so disgusting. Germans are proper ashamed of their past which is admirable, yet you lot say ignorant shit like your rule was good for the colonies which is the problem.",

You say you don't blame the current generation yet at the same time put us all under the same umbrella like every single British person says this ignorant stuff and doesn't apologize or acknowledge the wrongdoing. etc. What you claim to believe and what you profess don't match.",

My response was meant to be instigate you, but you easily could have said yeah \"our government/some of our people are ignorant) yet you went on the defensive and started the \" you indians\" which your ancestors liked to do as well.

Americans do not have this same culture of acceptance and equality - they often cannot even admit that they are American (unless discriminating against people who are not white) and they will claim 51% irish 22% italian 5% african 1% cherokee or some nonsense like this, and justify their racist behaviour with it - when you consider that it is little wonder the 'research' came from there\n\nand finally dating profiles are obviously not representative of real life, OKcupid are not an authority on the matter, not even close. and \"likelihood of contact\" isn't a good metric for relationship success\n\nHope you  have a good day",

But Britain also has a very hateful past, especially considering their colonial exploits and actions that still have impacts in their former colonies to this day. I also heard of P*ki bashing, which was a period in 1950’s Uk where South Asians were being targeted quite frequently as they arrived in large numbers.

The south East Asian population in the UK has been here now for 50+ years. We are on second and third generations born in the UK. Effectively there are groups of south East Asians in the UK who are culturally European. They have been born, educated and lived in the UK all their lives. The colour of their skin is increasingly irrelevant to the local population. The UK population has learned about ethnic customs, food, movies from living in close proximity with SE Asians for a long time. It’s not a “foreign” concept to them.

Sure there is racism there but it's not as bad as in mainland Europe or US. Besides their PM, Home Secretary, London Mayor, First Minister of Scotland are all people of South Asian descent. No other European country has these many people of colour occupying top positions in government. As an Indian, I'd much rather live in the UK than the US or most other European countries.",
        "I have an evening job as an English teacher teaching EFL, so I'm perhaps not the best one to ask\n\nBut I think they react well, we have a varied amount of accents here in the UK as it is (search for south wales, liverpool and newcastle accents for some examples)  and the UK is very ethnically mixed also especially in the cities and larger towns so there are visiting accents from all over the world, so I think as a population we're used to hearing (and listening for) lots of subtle differences and adjusting quickly. Hearing a lot of variety sets you up well to hear more\n\nOriginal indian accent is one that sounds pretty familiar to us, but some of the phrases and verb order/tense (from mixing English language with sentence construction rules from other native languages, or from outdated textbooks which still  contain words that have gone out of fashion or expect you might be writing formal mail correspondence to hotel managers to ask to stay) more unique to India than British-Indians might catch some people out - but usually not a worry",

        "I think the experience of indian girls from their families/other indian guys is enough to turn them away. Plus for atleast a lot of NRI desis in the U.S. when they go out to date they are more interested in cultures different to them than their own. This goes for both guys and girls. Also NRI communities might be very insular and in a particulary town or city it might be too awkward dating someone whose family might be friends with your family. I think this might be the reason people might be hesitant to date within their own race. As for dating Indians living there( as in those that came there for work/study) the internet has without jsut cause or not created a pretty bad picture of indian men but i dont think theres anything negative about indian women in particular on the internet for them to not be dated.",

You understand the point of conservatism is above all else to maintain hierarchy and to keep things the same as they always were, to not rock the boat, or make real change? those terms are invented as a way to neuter the opposition. Expecting them to only fight racism and discrimination, with yet more racism and discrimination, a completely non-sensical lens through which to view the world. Throwing fire on a fire, to maintain the status quo, in a world which likes to burn it all to the ground for the profit it generates\n\nI'm simply attempting to point out to you that the real opposition to those ideas that have caused all of this mess in the first place is what I am asking of you, you won't fix it by getting angry and circling the wagons, or with lack of willingness for teaching, sharing, openness and inclusivity. You're actively causing the issue you purport to have made your job or mission to prevent, that's a contradiction, and I don't think it comes from a place you necessarily want to be in either but there's clearly some anger there that I don't think is who you really are\n\nPeace",

If you don't even make an effort not to sound like an obvious foreigner in the UK, nobody can help you.",
        "I think it depends solely on the importance each race attaches to dating. The overwhelming majority of indian men dont get into the dating game till late. And by that i mean the attention paid to fitness, grooming. But i see that changing a lot with younger generations in india so young people are making an effort be attractive to whoever they want to date. Most people that come abroad for them dating isnt the no. 1 priority so obviously they will be at a disadvantage. Also social skills is not at all given importance in India. It takes someone to be in a culture and a certain environment to gain the social skills that are needed for dating. most indian men (or women) growing up in India aren't exposed to that. There are always exceptions but its not the norm.",

One of my closest grad school friends was American-Bangladeshi, and I watched his parents burn three different relationships this way.\n\nThere is a \\*lot\\* of pressure on desi in the States to date within their race, maybe because it's way more likely that they're 1st generation, and their immigrant parents are more likely to be traditionally-minded.\n\nI dated an Indian guy, he was already in his 40's and hadn't been \"allowed\" to date during University and Medical School, which is where most Americans meet their spouses. For years, his parents held out hope that he would meet a nice Indian girl, until he was diagnosed with a serious, life-threatening illness that starts with a C. After he (fortunately) recovered, they flipped and told him, \"we don't care who you marry, we want you to have someone who will take care of you.\"",

Most indians dont have that luxury or societal acceptance to do that. So for those men to come into a new environment and accept to be kings of dating is unreasonable.

They chose something else because of different dating preferences. There is nothing wrong with it but here in the UK it's quite common that Indian girls prefer white guys over Indians and again the keyword is *generally*.\n\nEDIT: To support your point, I matched with a lady around 33, British, with a kid in the process of divorce and she was bittersweet to me and yeah the husband was Asian.

    "light_cleaned_title": "Why are Indian men among the more desired group of men in United Kingdom dating scene while they aren't anywhere close in United States dating scene?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "we know about the United States dating scene data of okcupid but i was searching about some data on United Kingdom dating scene and i got that, i have linked in comments if you cant see the archived website, i am copy pasting the blog post in here. # Interracial Dating: Which Ethnicity Is Most Preferred in the UK? • January 24, 2014 The answer might surprise you… It has been said that the United Kingdom has the highest rate of interracial relationships — ten times that of the European average. We decided to put this theory to the test and analyzed over 1.8 million online dating interactions in the United Kingdom to discover the likelihood of users to contact other users based on race. We’ll let the results speak for themselves. &#x200B; The data showed that Indian men AND Latina women were the ethnicity most preferred by the opposite sex. White men were 5.2% more likely to contact a woman if she was not White. Black women are 9% more likely to click on a non-Black man than a Black man. This is contrary to what we saw in the US where Black women were 3 times more likely to contact a Black man. Additionally, Black men are 16% more likely to contact a non-Black woman than a Black woman. Asian and Latina women are the only female groups to prefer their same ethnicity. It’s apparent that online daters in the United Kingdom prefer to date outside of their own ethnicity. This trend is also true for the United States — across the pond, U.S. daters most preferred Asian women, except for Asian men. Talk about shocking!",

We are miles ahead of America when it comes to accepting anyone and everyone (UK) You guys also do love a fair bit of conquering LESSSGOO r/uk or something. Typical Indian response I take it? Stuck on past grudges and not looking at the present. Hahaha no I just wanted to see your response and you've come through like i expected. I don't blame the current English gen for anything, the sins of the father are not of the son, but you guys not acknowledging any wrong was done is so disgusting. Germans are proper ashamed of their past which is admirable, yet you lot say ignorant shit like your rule was good for the colonies which is the problem. Ah yes let's ignore 200+ years of plundering, torture, famines, instigation of religious feuds like separation of India and Kashmir issues, etc. because now Indian men are \"preferable\" in the UK dating scene. Typical british response. And you replied as I expected. Labeling each individual British person under the same umbrella, blaming us all for our government's unwillingness to apologize. You say you don't blame the current generation yet at the same time put us all under the same umbrella like every single British person says this ignorant stuff and doesn't apologize or acknowledge the wrongdoing. etc. What you claim to believe and what you profess don't match. Typically Indians are in a much better socio-economic strata out of the other migrants…..language isn’t an issue for them and who doesn’t like butter chicken! None of which was done by me, so why do you hate me as an individual? The same reason lots of Indians hate Pakistanis they have never met before just \"because\" I take it? Damn. Time to move to UK. I mean you represented your people by saying \" we are way more inclusive than Americans\" so it was a reasonable assumption that you might be willing to take credit for the actions of your people too lol, you can't just become part of the unit while throwing yourself compliments and then completely remove yourself when a negative point comes up. My response was meant to be instigate you, but you easily could have said yeah \"our government/some of our people are ignorant) yet you went on the defensive and started the \" you indians\" which your ancestors liked to do as well. You really think you're in the right coming to a country's sub reddit as a foreigner and then saying shit like \" typical Indian\" and other stupid shit like that lol None of them was done by you but none of your response shows that you even acknowledge that your country absolutely fucked over many countries and all your wealth today has come from the conquering of the victim countries our time has come boys pack up Why do you have so much hate towards me bro? I don-t have any hatred towards you or the Indian peoples. It pains me that we have to go through this crap just because the past was brought up once again when it never needed to be in the first place, why did you instigate this chain of comments, to rile me up? Probably has something to do with media and representation. Indians in UK are much more diverse in terms of occupations and economic status and many TV shows feature Indian actors. In US on the other hand, Indians are mainly Software Engineers, who have reputation of being nerdy in US and the profession does not enjoy good reputation in US dating scene. I didn't even bring up the past colonialism at all, you instigated this hatred chain of comments and I want no part of your hatred. I have 0 hatred towards you, my initial comment was banter ( with obvious backing of facts, the English did colonize more than half the world) I just dislike people who don't acknowledge injustices, I'm not saying thats you, but I've seen so many Brits, in real life as well as online say their rule was good for the colonies and they got civilization to us. Your response of \" typical Indian\" is definitely not a good look though. I have responded to your other comment with an explanation. You have no business talking about \" hatred\" when you response to a comment which was made in jest is \" typical Indian response\" There was no way of me knowing it was made in jest unless you made a /S at the end of your comment as such is typical on Reddit. You know that full well. Cease sending me comments of hatred. *please* It was obviously made in jest, anyone who isn't looking to get offended can see it. Your response of stereotyping indians is the one of hatred. Cease overreacting. There was no way of me knowing it was made in jest unless you made a /S at the end of your comment as such is typical on Reddit. You know that full well. There wad no need to bring up past colonialism at all, completely irrelevant to the thread. Cease sending me comments of hatred. please It was not obvious, this is the internet. I am blocking you as you refuse to stop replying to me when I asked nicely as I want no part of your hatred. All this could have been avoided but you randomly needed to bring up colonialism out of nowhere because you're obsessed. From what ive heard from friends in USA, Indian men in USA do very well with Asian, especially Chinese women, since both Indians and Asians usually are top of their schools and universities in grades, and in USA have similar culture regarding studies and success. Also, both Chinese and Indian Gen Z in USA look down upon whites and other races as they dont consider them smart lol My black friend who goes to a Top uni in USA said that almost all East Asian women date Indian men in his uni, another Iranian guy I know said that in his school every second Asian woman dated Indian man I heard they like druggies and rappers Yes but you still benefit from all that money. Your NHS is a thing today because of that money. r/uttarakhand Butter Chicken They are talking about dating prospects of Indian men between UK and US. In UK, majority of the Indian guys are 2nd or 3rd gen, hence fully immersed/blended as British. In US, majority are still H1s or Intl Students that are preferred less and less in comparison to the Caucasians. And no, butter chicken and socio economic strata have nothing to do with it. Wrong! In UK, majority of the Indians are 2nd or 3rd gen, born/raised in UK and blended in the society as British, hence have a better dating prospects. Nothing to do with being or not racist. Check out British TV and movies, always one brown character - not the immigrant but the one born/raised in UK. guilt of oppressing us for 200 years, may be. London calling Boyz Dude India is literally ranked as the most racist country in the world. There is some racism in the US but it's nothing compared to India, it's just that the racism in the US is shown in the media and in India it has been normalised. People here causally pass racist, sexist, casteist remarks It's been 84 years So true. I really don't care about this wow Least obvious fed. Stop giving me hope yall😔 I wonder how its for Canada with how big of an indian population is there aswell All he said was British don't deserve praise for this small thing because of all the other stuff. He's saying be neutral on this topic, it isn't anything praiseworthy. There is no discussion of you as an individual. You inserted yourself here pretending to be better than Americans and butthurt when someone talks about the bigger picture. Indians are way richer and more educated and in better jobs in America than in the UK. College costs more in America than in the UK but so many students happily pay extra. A dating app stat doesn't prove anything about racism, not in a country famous for having ugly people. Highly skeptical of the data and result UK ticket booked I lived in the UK for four years and found the locals to be very open-minded and accepting of new cultures into their native culture. Desis of UK are also integrated to the point of being culturally indistinguishable from ethnic Brits. I dated a couple of British dudes too and they were hardly interested in my \"foreign\" status lol pretty much treated me like I was a local. Honestly I'd have imagined this to be same in the US but I don't have any experience of living there. Anglosphere countries are geny very open to immigrants and new cultures. British and American men aren't equal looks wise. It's American>Indian>British when it comes to men. Completley agree. He was clearly antagonising by bringing up colonialism out of nowhere when it literally had no relevance towards the thread whatsoever, not even an iota, and in the end tried to play it off as a joke without any clear indication that it was, as I told him it is customary to place an /S at the end when you are not being serious as the internet does not make it so clear which he didn't understand, I even asked him to stop messaging me because I got sick of his hatred comments but he did not so I was forced to block. Because British love masala 😉 Moving to UK soon. 🤡 Namaste london effect Ok Canada? You mean west Punjab ? i stay in the uk and can confirm this is not completely true. Hello, from UK here - I guess it came up on my homepage as a summoning I wouldn't trust this information, we don't use the word \"latino\" or \"asian\" to mean that here, they've completely missed the mark with this 'research' into the 'data' and I say research in inverted commas because this is pop psychology and social sciences and it's not a real science - not attended to by real scientists or statisticians or analysts - **especially** nobody reputable would put their good name to conducting 'race science' in the modern day The second reason this trend may be noticed if it exists at all is that British-born Indians will still list their ethnicity as Indian on their profile (or as 'British Asian' to include India/Pakistan/Bangladesh), there are several generations of Indian people who were born here (maybe 4-5 generations) so it's not necessarily immigrants moving that are having the success, it is people still as part of the British culture as anybody else born or living here.... Americans do not have this same culture of acceptance and equality - they often cannot even admit that they are American (unless discriminating against people who are not white) and they will claim 51% irish 22% italian 5% african 1% cherokee or some nonsense like this, and justify their racist behaviour with it - when you consider that it is little wonder the 'research' came from there and finally dating profiles are obviously not representative of real life, OKcupid are not an authority on the matter, not even close. and \"likelihood of contact\" isn't a good metric for relationship success Hope you have a good day They are obsessed with Indian Film Stars. I think this is also the same in countries like Australia. Because have you seen Indian men in US vs the other men? Let's move to UK to get ghosted by people saying BoOhwOWoer Sameeeee >I heard they We live in the age of the internet. What is \"I heard\" ? Spicy hai sab, sirf chocolate hai colour! I am sorry I forgot With internet Humans forgot to hear This is a really good answer! Okay. \\*Cancels flight\\* Just so you guys know from first hand experience.. Indian men are some of the most desirable men in Latin America including Mexico. It's akin to attention Europeans get in Thailand and vietnam Reverse Colonization ..... Laughs in Edwina Mountbatten One infograph does not qualify as a trusted source of information my guys 🏃🏃🏃 Apna time aagya hai 😎. Apna jalwa dikhayange Already done Sunak ne kardiya. Damn it I was gonna come to Britain after this post, but not now ig😭 Come anyway, the weather is nice today, although maybe not tomorrow ...also bring mango lassi recipes, we've figured out how to make a vindaloo but haven't figured out how to stop it burning yet 😂 His wifey is Indian ... Doesn't count ...haha Sauce? It wasn't out of nowhere, you were talking about being less racist than America which is clearly not true. It's not even been a 100 years since independence. It's a little ridiculous to expect people to forget all about it. That's the difference between you and America. They STILL have affirmative action 100s of years later. Arey dadaji aap yahan Turn off the gas ,simple asf🫡 Time has cum 🫠 Most Indians are educated, and in good paid jobs/businesses. Indians still are traditional when it comes to relationship dynamics (which has its pros and cons) White men have moved on from being in traditional monogamous relationships, and are either content creators or bit coin evangelists. Indian men have become a safer choice. Yeah, lol. I do have future plans on coming to the UK for work-related purposes for a few years. One of my close relatives stayed in the UK for 4-5 years and they tell me that the weather is just amazing + people are really friendly compared to the US. They showed me a video of their then-neighbor's kids. The kids will wake up early and Nerf battle with each other. Even those kids were friendly to them. You know people are actually nice when even their children are nice. Also, wanted to visit the UK ever since I was a kid because of harry potter. Indians in US are known to be \"nerdy,\" But I have seen a lot of Indians who have immigrated dating locals. This seems entirely false, most people in the United States don’t care about ethnicity or origin. Ofc you don’t have any hatred. When your happily spending money that your government made using the blood, sweat, and tears of Indians for hundreds of years, you never have any hate towards us 😂 The UK and its people now is not the same as the UK back then. What is wrong with Reddit. I'm trying to talk about present day and all anyone else can talk about is the past, doesn-t anybody see? Dadaji has needs too beta Dude shut the fuck up Infosys ke daamad ji. Haan haan, correct kiya hai, aagaye meri maut ka tamasha dekhne Quite an exaggeration. Most people still date in their own races. Likely to find an Indian with white gf than Chinese gf. I’m in US fyi. Only right answer. Papaji padhai vaste UK jana zarrori hunda 🙏 Chicken tikka masala It’s not like Indian girls themselves don’t like such people. But they are minority and probably girls you don’t want for date. As the commenter above said it’s mostly because of lack of diversity. Also Indians in US are relatively less assimilated compared to UK. Because good amount of them are still migrants or second generation citizens. I am in UK and mujhe toh koi bhav nahi deta When others visit UK do they like your accent? Gandhiji got us freedom for this lessgo Now, I’m gonna try and be more neutral. As a American, the U.S has had a lot of racial issues in the past and it’s hard to make excuses for any of that. I have heard countless stories and it’s sad to see a lot of the stories about hate that come out. But Britain also has a very hateful past, especially considering their colonial exploits and actions that still have impacts in their former colonies to this day. I also heard of P*ki bashing, which was a period in 1950’s Uk where South Asians were being targeted quite frequently as they arrived in large numbers. Indians in the U.S have rarely had this problem aside from a few isolated incidents. While Indian culture isn’t as popular in U.S compared to U.K, Indians have usually fared pretty well in the U.S I am in the UK 😉 2014? that ancient data Face issue. Fact. India main bhi wohi haal tha acche din kya mausam hai udhar dating ka bro? Dude, i don't think it's true. Indians are looked really down in most foreign nations, especially with increasing Chinese influence due to immigration from Hong Kong. Indians, Pakistani, and Bangladeshis are hated equally for being loud, indulging in religious fanatic and smelly. Recently read about South korea, where they have placed banners reading Indians and Pakistani are not allowed. Canada and Australia have been implementing a ban on Indian students, and the ones already there are treated like troublemakers who don't follow the law. South East Asian zones have mostly tamils in Malaysia and Singapore, and you will feel the divide between the races, Indian are usually seen as low earning daily labourers. Dubai and Arab regions were the only places where I felt Indians were accepted unconditionally. The Indian image comes from the development of the country, which has been stuck in the developing stage for the last 30 years, we are still struggling to provide basic amenities in the capital city and tourist share their horrifying experiences of being scammed and molested once they return. Great in London(maybe because it's cosmopolitan), but not so great for the countryside. mereko toh kucch nahi mila dating apps pe abhi tak lmao mom said why's a handsome young man like you not making \"friends\" in the uk (real) Chalo UK..🥳 Kya, meri GK should make Alia feel proud? Interesting That's absolute bullshit. Indian's are literally almost at the bottom of the pile when it comes to Asian women (Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese). Chinese won't even marry American's (unless they are very westernized) and will always date and mingle amongst other Han Chinese. They’re finally starting the reparations. I like that take. Very sound Huge migration of indian and South Asians to the UK over centuries, maybe ? I am not overly fussed on gender or ethnicity, but we have a big asian population in the UK so perhaps its that? Im not sure on the stats tho so I could be wrong Why exactly? What's wrong? In desi culture it’s pretty much date to marry. This is common for both men and women. They date in the intention to get married whereas white propel and others are more casual about it. If a brown dude was dating for fun instead they would be in a disadvantage like the others as well. So they pair up with other desi’s really well. Hence taking up a portion of successful dating. South Korea is an inherently racist country. Anyone who is not South Korean faces discrimination there. For Canada it’s more to do with over immigration and in Australia only 3 colleges banned students from UP and a couple other states. In US Indian immigrants are the highest earners and they certainly get good jobs there. UK has a sizeable Indian population which at this point is probably considered native to them. Arab countries on the other hand are notorious for treating Indians as second class citizens. The amount of slave labour in countries like Qatar proves that. Also UAE prefers Western “expats” over Indian “immigrants” especially with respect to high earning jobs. Abey Infosys tha lodu No sorry, you haven’t figured out how to make vindaloo. Tastes nothing like the real thing. Same with the rogan josh, korma and any other “Indian food” in the UK. Time to go to UK. (Booking train to Uttarakhand on Tatkal rn) Upvote for reference to what is still today a banger track. My question is how do people react to the original Indian accent? Time to go the UK It’s seasonal, they just drool upon their Indian origin PM That's not vindaloo! It's made with pork, red dried chillies and vinegar and its origin is Portugal. Haan bhai bina lodu bole bhi samjha sakta tha, par theek hai, harkat waisi hi hai. Tcs, Tata, sorry Tata the legend :/ By Asian women they meant East Asians, not Indians. Indian girls don't swipe Indian men even if they look below average. And East Asians stick to East Asians because their English is quite bad. Some eg: I've to write an extra line to explain sometimes; Another time I texted 9ish and she got confused by it. Is and are ka b maa behen kr dete hai PS: I got more matches from East Asians and others and zero from Indians and I know Indian girls who have explicitly said they don't swipe Indian guys. Dating preference? Lol What is the actual trend as per your observation? What’s that famous Daler Mehndi song? - Sunak Sunak sun, ta na na Probably because the Indian guy is very likely to be already known or even related to someone you know. If they are dating for fun only, they wanna make sure it's easy to cut off and not see each other again. Uk is small and i imagine Indian community is quite tight knit. In what world are women less likely to be contacted than men? Data seems sus What do you hope to gain with these digs at my honest attempt above, or towards the people who came here working with what they have available? your profile reveals the sort of miserable walking contradiction you are... gate-keep 'authenticity', shame and exclude... **or** peace-keep, build bridges, teach and share... pick **one** I hope you can change your mind with time... the hot coal you hold on to will burn your hand long before you can throw it at someone else, otherwise From personal experience, Indian women are more desirable than Indian men in the UK. Indian men have had more racial abuse from brits compared to Indian females. But this is from personal experience I don't know what the statistics say Not really it's quite big. Maybe it boils down to your dating preference? I've heard some of them say they want to date \"gore\" ladke :p In the US we are taking away their jobs! In the UK, probably their contribution towards reparation. I was going \"Yeah sounds reasonable\" reading your post until it came to the part about Arab countries. I lived in one for 16 years of my life, South Asians are not accepted unconditionally and treated well. Now I trust nothing of what you said. Especially the \"No Indians and Pakistanis allowed\" boards in SK. At most, they ban all non-koreans. Preference kuch nahin sirf novelty chaiye. It's internet dating afterall. As an Indian (Tamil) married to a UK English girl, i just wanted to add some clarity on this. It’s not desirability of an ethnic group at play here. The south East Asian population in the UK has been here now for 50+ years. We are on second and third generations born in the UK. Effectively there are groups of south East Asians in the UK who are culturally European. They have been born, educated and lived in the UK all their lives. The colour of their skin is increasingly irrelevant to the local population. The UK population has learned about ethnic customs, food, movies from living in close proximity with SE Asians for a long time. It’s not a “foreign” concept to them. Hence the relationships between these ethinic groups tend to work. Yup bs mai bolna nai chah rha tha aise xD wow, you're saying chinese and indian gen z there are racist and consider OTHERS dumb? and I can still smell the fresh paint... Damn now I have to travel to TWO places instead. >India is literally ranked as the most racist country in the world. By biased anti-Indian western sources. Which means it's about as relevant as the chewing gum I just spat out. Skill issue I don't see what's so inaccurate about the comment. Anglosphere countries (U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada particularly) in general are the best at assimilating migrants, so makes sense that you'd see the most interracial marriages and dating there. In the U.S., I'd confirm that men are agnostic when it comes to race and will date/marry anyone. It tends to be women that are much more particular for some reason. So black women generally prefer black men, most white women are reluctant to date East or South Asian men... interestingly, even ethnically East and South Asian women are much more likely to be reluctant to date East and South Asian men. There was even a \"This American Life\" episode about it on National Public Radio. An Asian American girl was talking about how she just really wasn't attracted to men of her ethnicity, meanwhile her brother--- a successful career professional with a great personality--- couldn't find love. This trend for all women breaks down the more educated they are, it appears. As much as I abhor colonialism and can't stand it when a Brit tries to justify/downplay the negatives of their colonial past, this individual has got a point when they say that modern day UK is a way more tolerant country than the US and most other western nations. Every poll/survey/statistic on racist attitudes and incidents shows the UK to be the least racist country in Europe and one of the least racist in the world. Sure there is racism there but it's not as bad as in mainland Europe or US. Besides their PM, Home Secretary, London Mayor, First Minister of Scotland are all people of South Asian descent. No other European country has these many people of colour occupying top positions in government. As an Indian, I'd much rather live in the UK than the US or most other European countries. I have an evening job as an English teacher teaching EFL, so I'm perhaps not the best one to ask But I think they react well, we have a varied amount of accents here in the UK as it is (search for south wales, liverpool and newcastle accents for some examples) and the UK is very ethnically mixed also especially in the cities and larger towns so there are visiting accents from all over the world, so I think as a population we're used to hearing (and listening for) lots of subtle differences and adjusting quickly. Hearing a lot of variety sets you up well to hear more Original indian accent is one that sounds pretty familiar to us, but some of the phrases and verb order/tense (from mixing English language with sentence construction rules from other native languages, or from outdated textbooks which still contain words that have gone out of fashion or expect you might be writing formal mail correspondence to hotel managers to ask to stay) more unique to India than British-Indians might catch some people out - but usually not a worry >I hope you can change your mind with time... the hot coal you hold on to will burn your hand long before you can throw it at someone else, otherwise nice phrase I think the experience of indian girls from their families/other indian guys is enough to turn them away. Plus for atleast a lot of NRI desis in the U.S. when they go out to date they are more interested in cultures different to them than their own. This goes for both guys and girls. Also NRI communities might be very insular and in a particulary town or city it might be too awkward dating someone whose family might be friends with your family. I think this might be the reason people might be hesitant to date within their own race. As for dating Indians living there( as in those that came there for work/study) the internet has without jsut cause or not created a pretty bad picture of indian men but i dont think theres anything negative about indian women in particular on the internet for them to not be dated. Only in North America. In the UK Asian typically refers to people from the Indian subcontinent +1 I would hope so, but if not they can always travel 15 minutes down the road and hear a completely different accent :D The same happens when I travel to other parts of the UK, when I went to university I was the only person from my home town and still other Brits found hours of fascination in getting me to say words like \"bus\" or \"shopping\" or \"now\" 😂 Lmao what? They weren’t digs *at you*, just a comment that BIR don’t know how to make a vindaloo? Or proper Indian food in general? Giving real single white female vibes here with stalking my profile and stuff, calm down lady. Koi gori paaati ya muth pay hi guzara hai Why Indian women are the least desired when men are the most? I am making a guess that Indian men are mostly married to Indian women due to family pressure so Indian girls know that they already have an ethnicity advantage so they don't go to appeal opposite fender Maybe your experience is different because you still speak Indian English. British people would say 'I live in the UK', not 'stay'. If you're the typical first generation Indian immigrant that exclusively lives with and socializes with other first generation Indian immigrants, of course non Indian women in the UK aren't going to hit on you. I lived in UK for couple of years girls date whites first then black ( bad boy image ) latinos ( they are carefree stylish and party type) arabs ( same like latinos) and our desi came last . Those who are 2 and 3 gen brit desi it easy coz they have blended into the culture but someone from india / pak expat aren’t that desirable…i lived there for 4 years just telling this from my observation how dating scene was in my uni …most indian were considered nerds with low dating game . Bad dressing sense and typical desi accent didn’t help either lol Yalgaaaaar hoooooo It's not just my experience but I have many british asian friends and know the reality. And i learnt english in Dubai. I don't see how that's relevant. The idea that Indian men are considered attractive in UK is blatantly false, I have several friends who’ve said that the moment they mention they’re Indian, its over. Considering how racist Chinese. I call bs on this one. Go to r/asianmasculinity they'll tell u how white worshipping asian women are Because Indians are very visible in the UK, and many people have grown up seeing them? Indian isint a race... this graph looks bogus lmao. Has to be south Asian. Also did the Bois miss the part where this graph was from 2014.... No it's not true. Many indian origin people like Vickstar123 , Hamza(Pakistan) they are popular in UK and look at Vickstar123 , he looks better than a major population of men in UK. So this creates a better image of indian origin men who are in UK . Reverse colonisation ka time aa Gaya hain… teen Guna Thats what i thought too. Also the data says indian women are least desirable - I thought it was the exact opposite in foreign countries. It only took a moment, I wanted to see ***why*** you felt that way (why gatekeep/shame/exclude/look down upon) when I approached with kindness, humour and open-invitation As soon as I saw phrase and terminology I would associate with having internet-absorbed the \"American democratic left\" and their racial policy, propaganda and discourse (which if you've seen a political spectrum graph lately would place it firmly in the conservative section) - like affirmative action, lived experience, roles, burden, privilege, authentic, systemic, white woman, \"I would instead read a book by an indian author\", only x own y - and now calling me a 'white female' I kinda pieced together where you were coming from with it. You understand the point of conservatism is above all else to maintain hierarchy and to keep things the same as they always were, to not rock the boat, or make real change? those terms are invented as a way to neuter the opposition. Expecting them to only fight racism and discrimination, with yet more racism and discrimination, a completely non-sensical lens through which to view the world. Throwing fire on a fire, to maintain the status quo, in a world which likes to burn it all to the ground for the profit it generates I'm simply attempting to point out to you that the real opposition to those ideas that have caused all of this mess in the first place is what I am asking of you, you won't fix it by getting angry and circling the wagons, or with lack of willingness for teaching, sharing, openness and inclusivity. You're actively causing the issue you purport to have made your job or mission to prevent, that's a contradiction, and I don't think it comes from a place you necessarily want to be in either but there's clearly some anger there that I don't think is who you really are Peace Could it be due to Indian population our south east asian size in the UK? It is relevant because in Dubai, they speak Indian English, and it's obvious to me from that one sentence that you aren't assimilated into British culture. Second generation Indian British men, or those that make an effort to assimilate, don't have a problem dating and marrying non Indian women in the UK - you can check the statistics. If you don't even make an effort not to sound like an obvious foreigner in the UK, nobody can help you. I think it depends solely on the importance each race attaches to dating. The overwhelming majority of indian men dont get into the dating game till late. And by that i mean the attention paid to fitness, grooming. But i see that changing a lot with younger generations in india so young people are making an effort be attractive to whoever they want to date. Most people that come abroad for them dating isnt the no. 1 priority so obviously they will be at a disadvantage. Also social skills is not at all given importance in India. It takes someone to be in a culture and a certain environment to gain the social skills that are needed for dating. most indian men (or women) growing up in India aren't exposed to that. There are always exceptions but its not the norm. Born in the UK and just wanted to say from my experience that if a UK girl were to date S.Asians then it will be those that are UK born. A UK girl with a foreign born S. Asian is extremely rare. All the foreign born S. Asians usually stick to their own I'm guessing because of cultural similarities. I don’t think the fact that some Indians have become popular is indicative of anything. Hell, Rishi Sunak, an Indian origin man, is their PM. But this doesn’t indicate anything about how the average brown skinned person is treated in the UK. I would say somewhat similar statistics to the US, but far less to do with racism and much more to do with cultural self-segregation. A large chunk of Indians in Canada are recent immigrants, and therefore haven't assimilated as well in Canadian society. But the dating statistics among 2nd or 3rd+ generation Indians would be pretty good. It's true buddy. I am from the UK and S.Asian guys are the lowest desired from UK (white) girls. There are some girls that will date S.Asians but 99.9% of the time have to be UK born S.Asians. >ut this theory to the test and analyzed over 1.8 million online dating interactions in the United Kingdom to discover the likelihood of users to contact other users based on race. We’ll let the results speak for themselves. Oh God, you have to cross the channel and see how we are treated. lol >hough maybe not tomorrow > >...also bring mango lassi recipes, we've figured out how to make a vindaloo but haven't figured out how to stop it burning yet 😂 Lol too gloomy for my taste, would prefer coastal Italy hahaha Absolute facts. A lot of Indians on here are getting excited but in reality they will have a very slim chance with a UK girl. In fact foreign born Indian men have a very bad reputation here in the UK. They're seen as creeps/perverted/thirsty etc. how the turntables..... Lol seriously? I love Latinas wanna try to date them. We like to shit ourselves don't we? Saying Indian men are shit is quite ignorant. You'll find shitty men everywhere. Don't tie it to a particular ethnicity. dayum! Speak for yourself, I’m friends with quite a few software engineers / IT geeks and every single one of them has a very good looking girlfriend and has zero issues with dating Yes brit girls dont think desi expats as attractive romantic lovers rather than sex starve immigrants who just want to either score to quench their thirst or want to dupe em my marrying em to get the nationality . You 100% right …..Yes its exact opposite coz indian/arab girls are bit conservative and choosy they were regarded as exotic and hard to get …no wonder everyone wants to date em . Also indian/ arab girls aren’t considered shallow who wants a quick shaq and fuck off types , so most people treat em like genuine girls for long term relationships haha, all original, I do all my own stunts :) I would have liked to discuss it further if headway could be made, I didn't even get to go on to my sandcastles analogy, may be best to let it settle before writing more walls of text. Technically it is on topic (racial dating preferences and the motivation to analyse them must come from deeply rooted racist ideology somewhere) but I don't think this was the expected depths to delve into when it was posted it's cuz Indians have no social skills. Most of them barely learn to talk to women (from a dating perspective) in childhood years and the ones that move out are all the nerdy, computer sciency types that are just focused on work. and not perfecting their appearance/learning social skills. All this means they'll be the bottom strata for desirable men time to move to UK American here. Several of my white female friends were in serious relationships with desi guys, and it was the guys' families who tanked the relationships by treating the girlfriends rudely at family functions, and putting their sons in hard positions where they had to choose between their families and their girlfriends. One of my closest grad school friends was American-Bangladeshi, and I watched his parents burn three different relationships this way. There is a \\*lot\\* of pressure on desi in the States to date within their race, maybe because it's way more likely that they're 1st generation, and their immigrant parents are more likely to be traditionally-minded. I dated an Indian guy, he was already in his 40's and hadn't been \"allowed\" to date during University and Medical School, which is where most Americans meet their spouses. For years, his parents held out hope that he would meet a nice Indian girl, until he was diagnosed with a serious, life-threatening illness that starts with a C. After he (fortunately) recovered, they flipped and told him, \"we don't care who you marry, we want you to have someone who will take care of you.\" 100% there’s massive [sampling bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias) in this data (The people who use this random site which at least in the U.K. is not mainstream is not going to reflect an accurate cross section of the U.K. population. Could be that Indian women are more likely to use this site. We don’t know, there’s no study here, just raw and uncleaned data. Can’t really draw any inferences from it.) That and also our girls have that naturally tanned skin and well defined facial features which they find attractive. Woah slow Monday? But thanks for the creeps/ LOLs anyway. I’m gonna go ahead and block you now before I find you standing outside my home or workplace with your vindaloo or something Scotland accent is funny for me I dont think its about being shitty. Its about being born in a culture that attaches importance to dating. This is not limited to indian men but also asian men. Western cultures are vastly different in which young people are encouraged to date and learn valuable social skills in high school/college. Most indians dont have that luxury or societal acceptance to do that. So for those men to come into a new environment and accept to be kings of dating is unreasonable. Just like how everyone in the U.S. wonders why the Indians and Chinese are the most successful. The culture values education so much a lot of people from these communities are lawyers, doctors and engineers. Its not like anyone is inherently inferior or superior. you’re making a whole bunch of assumptions. right from the fact that i “exclusively live with other indians”, there’s not one indian in my flat and that i have a problem with non indian females, which i don’t. i’ve seen “first generation” indians go out with white chicks and they don’t mind it. i’m just stating facts that from my perspective, i’ve seen more white guys in relationships than indians or any other ethnicity, be it first or second gen. and mind u i’m in university, where the hookup culture is insane. so i think my perspective carries some weight. bro konsa IIT lera? IIT------>oxford reverse colonisation🥰🥰😎 laxman ticket book kar.........kal subeh london nikalna hai Wtf are you ranting about? You said girls are deterred enough by their family and all which basically implies Indian men are shitty in a relationship. While your other points about values and skills are correct, I don't see the connection here. Mind explaining a bit? I was born and live in UK from Indian parents. Can confirm this is a load of rubbish. Dating is terrible for Indian men here! Bhai itna kya famous hu ki sab puch rahe hai. IIT Ropar me rh hu 😥 cse? Engineering physics 😥 White British people are also just uglier than white Americans. People aren't mentioning this here, but it does create less \"competition\" for Indian men when dating in the UK. On most metrics white British men are just less attractive: uglier, shy, awkward, unambitious, etc. rank kitni aayi? koi na IIT ja raha hai, congrats!! tujhee physics bhot pasand hai kya? Real reason - Indian parents in India searching for groom with 1 cr+ annual salary 7k aya tha. Haan physics aur coding se lagav hai. I don't agree with you. I am an Indian man myself but I can say without hesitation that your average Indian man is generally much shittier than your average man raised in the Western world (any race). Purely by numbers - pull up the per capita stats on abuse, violence against women, and sexual assault - you will see India is much worse than the west. Then look around. So many men with regressive thoughts and creepy attitudes against women even in urban, educated circles. It's all around us. There are great men, and they are plenty, no doubt about that. But there's an equal amount of bad apples - from casual misogynists to downright predators roaming around freely in schools, streets, and offices. Just talk to any woman and you'll hear a 1000 stories. India has a problem. No shame in admitting it. Only then we can fix it. Chicken tikka masala (in British accent) Chicken tikka masala !! Rarely it does so but when the UK weather does clear up it's blinding. Thanks for the clarity! I agree and the keyword is *generally*. The way it was phrased earlier by the other guy meant more like everyone. I know, I was being pedantic. And the reasons are also correct. People here are raised differently; you'll never find the concept of mixed sex flat in undergrad in India but it teaches you a lot of things. My other point was it's not only because they've met shitty Indian men previously so they chose different ethnicity to date. They chose something else because of different dating preferences. There is nothing wrong with it but here in the UK it's quite common that Indian girls prefer white guys over Indians and again the keyword is *generally*. EDIT: To support your point, I matched with a lady around 33, British, with a kid in the process of divorce and she was bittersweet to me and yeah the husband was Asian. He wanted her to do all the chores and all. Indians of the UK are way more assimilated and there are 4th and 5th gen British Indians too. Indian Americans on the other hand are mostly recent immigrants. Ah, I understand. Makes sense. Thanks for explaining! Alexa, play \" London Calling\" by the Clash. Apna time agaya bhenchod! 😎 Bhai best of luck, go for your passion (from your BBA counterpart 😂) Because in the U.K., Indian men are husband material: well educated, close-knit families, low divorce, hard working, high earners and if they also happen to look good then yes they tick all the boxes. There is no bad stereotype against Indians in the U.K., except that they’re Indians and India is a poor country with many slums. But that’s all, nothing too personal. I live in the US and it’s very rare I see an Indian girl with a non-Indian guy and almost every East Asian girl I see would be with a white guy. What world are you living in lmao. It’s the same in UK too and I lived there Once you go brown, the other colors let you down. Supply and demand people. Flood the market with supply and be prepared to see a glut in demand /s sudden spike in UK visa applications in 3....2...1... Jitna khush hona hai ho lo... Reality we all know... if not ask your friends living in uk are koi bhav nai deta browns ko udhar bhi indian pe hi line marni padti hai Yeah, bro is trying to roast us. Here, we are rocking six-pack abs while earning 6 figures. Personality can be nerdy but that doesn't classify to that classic glasses and nerd emoji-like look. A lot of us still look better than at least 80% of the population. I’m gonna say going with the overwhelming number and availability, statically it could make sense. 6 pack abs. Psssh. 7 is where it's at. Get with the times bruv. Alright, back to the gym. You said it blud 💪 I was dealing with a South Indian origin girl who was raised in South Africa about buying a used blender in South Brampton. My intentions were, get to the place we agreed, give exact money we agreed, get blender. Not sure about hers, the minute she saw me, she made a disgusted face. According to Indian beauty standards, many would do the same to her. I couldn't make the face but i suddenly didn't have the exact money and asked her for change. I insisted give change, take less money or I'm taking off. Got the blender for less than what we agreed. so who did he end up with , do u know ? Yall gotta learn to read article says most likely to be contacted due to race. That means most people you match with is because of your race,not that your race is on a whole most preferred. I think a lot of the terms used in this study aren't applicable to the U.K. This isn't true. They accept desi women but not desi men This is bullshit. I live in the UK they don't like indian men whatsoever. Black men are way more desired by white girls than indian guys. The only indian guys who are desired are punjabi looking guys and even then not really. Asian men are desexualised everywhere in the west One of the reasons that my brother told me that is in many countries he's been in, women tend to think Indian men stay loyal till the end. Because of the news that we have the lowest divorce rate and sometimes looking at the fellow Indians living near them. im white/american and Indian men are very desirable imo. i've never been with any, but I find them Hella attractive I get that it's fetishizing them and I get thats wrong in my sexual desires for them. honestly, I find every race sexy but I am really attracted to non-white men in general To the women reading my comment, many Indian guys might use you for dating but would then marry an Indian girl through arrange marriage. Most Indians in the UK like myself are second/third generation. So we are very relatable. But areas of England vary a lot. London its more normal than other areas to see mixed race or interracial. I grew up in all white area and got interest at school but noticed that once I went to university to the city. Suddenly Indian girls were more into me. Same with apps, Indian girls seem to be more interested. Bencho..hamare sath to Aisa ho nahi Raha idhar. Kisko mil Rahi dates idhar"
