    "selftext": "For refernce I'm a 13 year old OCI dude. No, seriously. While some things are good, and India COULD be a great nation, since the 2000s the Indian government has been such a shit I'm like genuinely worried of getting extra judicially murdered for my criticism at Modi. Let's start with what inspired me to write this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnao\\_dead\\_bodies\\_row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unnao_dead_bodies_row) . Bro wtf!! I just do not believe it was impossible to identify  a single girl. Nah hell no, I think either they were prostitutes of India's elite, which is bad enough, or they were murdered for some other reason (probably doing something that Modi jis retarded ideology doesn't agree with) and dumped into the river to cover it up. Can I just say I am sure that 95 percent of murder cases, it either goes unsolved (like the fucking clearance rate for murder is 35 percent, which is half of the American clearance rate which itself is total dogshit), or the 'perpetrator' was just someone who was framed because Is 'Ze great Modi ji' didn't like them? Muslims are being sent to what are essentially, concentration camps ,in Assam. The government promotes shitty bullshit like homeopathy and 'natural' medicine containing lead (I'm a total idiot but I know lead is GOING to kill you). 'La grande Modi ji' and his elite buddies keep pimping out poor girls and buying out all news outlets so they only spout hinduvata nonsense. Modi is a cunt. They keep spouting \"Digital India\". Well, you sick motherfuckers, in a country where the government doesn't even claim to be some digital leader, my classmates all have iPhone and iPad and high end MacBooks, and even I who is relatively poor for my country, I have a Galaxy A33 and a fairly modern PC and MacBook. Meanwhile I see my family members in India saying how good this cunt Modi is because smartphones are 'more affordable' there. All I see is a bunch of ewaste smartphones that is the best they can afford because Modi gives all they money to the elite prostitute pimps. I just want to vent because summer break begins soon and I have to go be under that sick pedophile Modi's rule and I just want to cut his penis off, no, let one of the poor girls who he and his pedo buddies pimp cut his penis off, and I've ranted enough so tell me if you agree or not.",
