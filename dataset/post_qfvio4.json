        "Taking a break from New World (Amazon's MMORPG) because I've really gotten into Riftbreaker, which is a mix of an isometric action RPG and RTS. Anyone who likes either of the two genres should totally give it a go.\n\nPre purchased Forza Horizon 5, so looking forward to playing that from 5th November!",

        "Got back to playing dota 2 is little bit more, slowly covering the storyline in FFXIV and Paladins for my casual shooter fix\nWill get back to Stellaris soon (steep learning curve but worth it!)",
        "I've heard that New World was frying people's GPUs. Did it happen to you too?",
        "Nah, that paranoia's been blown out of proportion and propagated by ignorant people who don't even own the game.\n\nThe only cards that got bricked were the high end (3080 and above) EVGA ones because they don't cap themselves well enough. The game basically went for max fps and ended up making the cards draw more power than they could handle.\n\nJayzTwoCents made a video about how GPUs from different brands behave while playing the game or running any benchmark in general. He compared an EVGA card to an MSI one and the EVGA was drawing a lot more power than it was supposed to.\n\nAmazon's asked all high end GPU users to limit New World's fps to 60 if they feel the need to take precautions.\n\nA few other cards crashed while playing the game but weren't damaged. The matter hasn't been investigated well enough to figure out what the issue really is.\n\nI have a Gigabyte 3060 Ti and it runs absolutely fine and I haven't even restricted the fps to 60.",

        "Itâ€™s possible on the new ones, nobody will buy intel ones anymore. On the M1 MacBook, CSGO was running over a 100 FPS last year with emulation. So I hope a bunch of games will be playable.",
        "Age of History 2 is pretty good. \n\nI started as a single district of Gwalior, forced my neighbouring states to fight each other and sent army there to rule them. Slowly entire North India was under my rule. Then I attacked Bengal, fucked them hard,then Vijayanagara in South, then I expanded to Phillipenes, Africa and Australia. Conquered almost entire Asia except the Southern part of China.\n\n\nTo do:\nCapture South China, Middle America, and Europe(its literally untouched by me)\n\nThen I will become the leader of this fucking world.",

        "Oh I've played Hollow Knight, it's one of my absolute favorites. I've also played Ender Lilies (another brilliant souls metroidvania) and Salt and Sanctuary (you can play couch coop with a friend and it's the most seamless experience I've had while cooping these games) \n\nI've had Dead Cells recommended to me before so I guess this is a chance to really check it out",
        "Ohhh i will check out both the games, also nice username.",
        "Haha thanks, surprisingly not many people catch on.\n\nEnder Lilies is a smaller game and a complete single player experience but the music, atmosphere and visuals are top class, the music alone is incredibly beautiful, capable of topping Hollow Knight.\n\nIf you have a friend you can play it with, Salt and Sanctuary is highly recommended. Even single player is a great experience but the coop is so seamless and so much fun",

I was understandably excited to play a sequel to it, but while it didn't live up to my expectations, it was still a lot of fun.\n\nStarted **Bad North: Jotunn Edition** (again an Epic Game freebie). Have almost never played these indie roguelites before, so wanted to try something new. So far, I'm really liking it. It has a simple gameplay loop and it's easy to play in short bursts. A flaw I'm seeing with the roguelite genre is a mistake undoes the progress of the entire run, which is a bit disheartening.",
