I wasn't aware of it until today when I found out that my mother's uncle was hit by stones thrown by people during those clashes.\n\nI've seen many people posting about how the government is fueling Hindus and how Hindus are targeting Muslims. But what actually happened here? A notice was sent to a dargah stating that it was built on state-owned land, and that's when everything started. My mother's uncle is a man in his 60s with a paralyzed son. He's the one who runs a small store to support his family of three. Just imagine going out for something and getting hit by Muslims with stones and fire in their hands simply because they received a notice. I don't care if you receive a notice according to the law, but setting vehicles on fire and throwing stones is never the solution.\n\nNow let me ask you, the \"peace-loving\" people. If you think about my mother's side of the family, is there any way they wouldn't harbor hatred towards the Muslim community? Most of us here were born with enough money to ignore the problems faced at the grassroots level. We embrace the idea of secularism and detest the \"idea\" of hating a particular community. But that's because most of us have never lived on the streets. Most of us have never experienced violence on the roads. I can guarantee that many of us have never visited a police station to file a complaint about violence.\n\nHowever, the reality of the problems on the ground is completely different. If you are the sole breadwinner in a very poor family burdened with debts, and then you get hit by a stone while walking home by a community that has taken matters into their own hands, there is no way you and your family won't harbor lifelong hatred towards that community. Stop complaining about \"hatred.\" This is not a world of strawberries where everyone is good. Hatred between communities is real. Even if you are a peace-loving individual, no one will spare you.",

        "I am really sorry for what happened to the old man. Such an incident definitely makes us angry and thinks twice about the idea of \"secularism\". This hatred would be passed on to the second generation. Maybe that generation won't choose violence but then again they might face such stone pelters, next thing you know stone pelters came into power in your area. Now the stone pelting will be done in lawful manner on the third gen and this gen just cannot tolerate it anymore and would opt for violence. This vicious cycle will continue and will not stop.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is that a common man who is living his life to earn for the family would never want such conflicts, would never want to see a Police station in their life, and would never want to be in a situation to file a complaint. We all want those strawberries but like you said ground reality is just thorns. \n\nWho is supposed to take care of these thorns, govt because we pay them to service us and make our life  better in society. We are busy making life for us but the responsibility of making life around us better is of the government. But instead they are using our money to hire bulldozers and then destroy the houses built by khoon paseene ki mehnat, destroying the roads to stop farmers who are fighting for their livelihood, resulting in growing more thorns. \n\nI know at personal level it feels we are wronged by a particular group of people but at a higher level we reap what we sow.",

Yes, our criminal justice system is broken but we need to fix that without taking recourse to \"shortcuts\"\n\nThe police in India with very few exceptions behave like a colonial power. We need to change that. I am not saying that the flogged persons are innocent. They may well be the vilest criminals. But, public flogging is not on the statute books and cannot be countenanced. \n\nPublic safety lies in the rule of law. Otherwise anyone can be beaten up by a policeman on any pretext.",
        "That's a video of public flogging of Muslim men. \n\n\nSorry for injury to your family member. \n\n\nHowever, it's Gujarat and we have to not believe anything that comes out from this state especially whatever Police sources tell. One person is dead, and police have not revealed his name - because he most probably died in police brutality. \n\nIt is most likely that, people came to protest and Gujarat police saw an opportunity to beat them up, and went about doing the same. Some people in crowd got agitated and threw rocks. And police had more reasons to do the same. Once situation calmed, they picked up some people, lined them up, beat the shit out of them to show others to stay in line.

        "What kind of shitty logic is this. You seem to be batting for collective hatred against all Muslims based on individual victims. And since this hatred started and spread long before your uncle's unfortunate suffering, you seem to be batting for collective hatred based on the probabilities of victims in future.\n\nIf that logic is fine, then somewhere today a Hindu must have surely been the victim of a road accident by a reckless Hindu driver or violence by another Hindu. Now justify why your logic can't be applied to ask every Hindu to hate every other Hindu.\n\nThere's a name for your logic. It's called the outgroup homogeneity cognitive bias. Yes, it's a bias.

        "Bro if the state wasn't sponsoring hatred against Muslims this wouldn't have happened or wouldn't have gotten this worse. Intolerant people are in each religion , on each side .
