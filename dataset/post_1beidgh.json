    "selftext": "Last year around November, I received a message from an unknown number on WhatsApp claiming that I had met him at the airport and paid his can fare of 1600rs. I had done few solo travels at that point, however i was sure I never paid for anyone's can fare. He kept insisting that we spoke and I paid it via cash and that now, he wants to pay me back via GPAY. I said no and blocked him. Today, I received a similar message from this guy. Attaching the screenshots of my conversation. I wanted to keep playing the game a bit more, but kids had to go to school. So blocked him.",

I would quickly check Truecaller and if i hav no idea who it is then i wouldn't even bother responding. As fun as it is messing with the scammers, I feel like its better not to get involved at all.",

        "Probably just recycled scam. Maybe if you agree he will send 16000 \"accidentally\". You will also get a SMS about amount transfer designed to look like real bank message. Then he will ask to transfer the balance amount",
