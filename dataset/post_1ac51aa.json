        "There is no Hope in Hell for rape victims in our India today.",
        "Even after multiple girls have come forward accusing Heetik Shah of being a repeat offender, some people are still doubting the girl, questioning if she‚Äôs doing this to malign the accused‚Äôs reputation. \n\nShows how our society thinks & the environment we create for the victims who do choose to come forward.",
        "Those people are idiots . I‚Äôm from Mumbai and this Heetik shah asshole has no reputation . Just a rich brat who thinks he‚Äôs above the law and is a repeat sex offender",
        "9 out of 10 rich Maharashtrians are sexual offenders. People misuse wealth",
        "Yeah agree but the difference is , this dude was known in sobo circles as a sexual offender from as early as middle school . Had been kicked out of school and stuff .everyone knew he was a perv but hung out with him for his money anyway",
        ">some people are still doubting the girl,\n\nTo be honest, this is mostly because of false rape cases. People can no longer trust women by default.\n\nThis case looks quite straight forward. The guy is apparently known to do this.",
        "We gotta take it to the streets and protest till justice is delivered.",
        "There aren't even so many fake rape cases. It's a myth perpetrated by Men's rights activists. In fact, there are way more unreported rape cases that nobody talks about. üôè",
        "Justice is a joke in India. The guy has powerful connections. Watch this case slowly be swept under the carpet.",
        "Oh fff off Man. \n\nGo to legal advice India. See the amount of post by men who have been falsely accused. May be not false rape case but so many false accusations. \n\nI personally know 4 people whose lives have been destroyed by women marrying and then filing different cases just to take the property away.",
        "Also, I read some horrible comments blaming the victim for going out with a stranger and having drinks with him. Is this how people think? A victim is coming forward to get justice and the first thing people do is point the finger AT HER? Shame.",
        "I understand where you‚Äôre coming from but shut the fuck up man. This is NOT THE TIME to cry about the rights of men. Have some fucking respect for the victim. THIS IS ABOUT WOMEN. You‚Äôre an embarrassment.",
        "It's crazy that for a huge chunk of people their first instinct is to question the victim rather than the accused. It's the very definition of rape culture.",
        "Trust straight men for making everything about themselves.",
        "Fake rape and false domestic abuse cases aren't the same though",
        "You mentioned some are doubting the girl I gave you the reason why. I never mentioned men's rights.",
        "Are you now going to cry about it? Read the comments first.",
        "True, I meant more about why people are doubting the girl. Not that I agree. \n\nThis case seems pretty clear.",
        "Then don't cry not all men when women say we can't trust men. Because fake cases are recent but real rapes and many such things have been happening since eternity. So yes we don't trust men",
        "I‚Äôm from Mumbai too but had never heard of him! Although I‚Äôve heard of the co-accused (the boys who threatened & intimidated the girl). One of them is Raja Dhody‚Äôs & Queenie Singh‚Äôs son. Just hope justice is delivered to the girl even if it isn‚Äôt swift!",
        "No. The victim deserves justice and the perpetrator punishment. \n \nBut people still shouldn't put themselves in potentially very unsafe situations.",
        "There is a difference between victim blaming and bringing up awareness. I hope you understand that.",
        "I saw few messages too. Horrible. Why would they start blaming women here. I understand she let her guard down but that happens to all of us and obviously by mistake. But that doesn‚Äôt give right to the guy to rape her or force her. \n\nWhat people don‚Äôt understand is often when you question the victim, you are standing in support of rapist. Nobody should go through these kinda loops for justice.",
        "sshh this is not the right place to talk senses. We are a misogynist and cunt and cry baby when we try to talk about being factual.",
        "It's like.. sharing your OTP with scammers and then saying it's not my fault. Definitely the scammers should be caught and charged, but why do people think there's no accountability for being stupid enough to share OTP??",
        "Are you fucking stupid? First we compare women with objects (ants are attracted to unwrapped candy, key and lock wala bullshit, etc) and now we‚Äôre comparing giving an OTP to a girl going out for a night out and getting roofied and raped? Bhai, usko sapna aaya tha kya ki normally bahar jaake she‚Äôd get assaulted? What sort of comparison is this?",
        "Hope whoever is telling the truth gets justice.",
        "The fact that any random man can turn out to be a rapist is a bigger issue than being stupid.",
        "While I agree that one must not be immediately assumed guilty, there should be a formal investigation conducted against the perpetrators, they deserve to be tried in the court of law and the victim needs to get her justice.",
        "For justice there has to be a public outcry to prevent judiciary and police to take 'Gobar' or bribe and ensure that the common man is watching this case closely.\n\n\nYou won't see public outcry in such cases at Large level like nirbhaya case etc. because the victim is considered responsible for what happened to her by a huge section of Mumbai level middle class as ' Why she took drinks, why she considered safe to go with a internet online stranger etc.etc.'.\n\n\nThe people who are making noise on internet forums don't usually go out and protest and are also¬† a minority.¬†\n\n\nPolitical parties won't take interest because there is no specific caste/ religious angle to this case.\n\n\nSo at the end victim is on her own until some big lawyer takes this case probono( last mein woh bhi setting hi karte hai )\n\n\n\n\nI really hope this Shah's and dhody get what they deserved .",
        "Hope this isn't another false case",
        "None of the perpetrators is a Marathi, all are gujrati sindi",
        "Not guilty until proven ü•≤ we have seen many cases where few girls falsely accused and inocent lost the life hope this is not the same case hope she provides legit evidence",
        "What happened to that bureaucrat son who try to kill his girlfriend nothing, he is enjoying his lavish life and that girl is suffering. This is only 1 month old news we all forget.",
        "Indians are now doing what they do best, blaming victims of sexual assault and rape. I read some comments on Instagram where they said both the guy and the girl in the wrong. I had no idea that a woman drinking alcohol was equivalent to a man being a serial rapist. Love my country and our wonderful Indian Kulcha, instead of doing anything to fix the inherent evil in our society we will blame victims and force them to live in hiding as if the rape was their fault. In a lot of sexual assault and rape cases the accused gets acquitted because it is extremely hard to prove crimes of a sexual nature, and all the MRAs think that means the case was fake. Acquittal does not equate to innocence.",
        "For a reason abroad calls India a rapist county",
        "üíØ as inhuman as this night sound to the real victim, the society is so fucked up that this is needed.",
        "'Justice'? \nIn this nation? That too in Maharashtra?",
        "yeah there should be proper and FAIR investigation , to make sure whether the possible wrongdoer is actually guilty or not, AND NOT based on improper evidence and random accusations NOR based on the fact that such cases can be rigged....",
        "I have myself stayed in Pune for several years and I am very well aware what a Marathi with several apartments and land does. Only the working middle class Marathi people are decent and sincere."
