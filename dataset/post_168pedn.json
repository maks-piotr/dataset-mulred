    "selftext": "Excerpts from the article\"\n*Alleged cover up by SEBI Chairman*\n\nThe revelation of the DRI letter suggests that either SEBI has suppressed facts and provided false information which amounts to perjury; or that the then SEBI chairperson instead of acting on the DRI letter preferred to close the ongoing investigations into the Adani group. The matter deserves the attention of the apex court because the SEBI chairperson in January 2014 retired only in February 2017 and is currently serving as “Non-Executive Independent Director-Chairperson” of NDTV, which was acquired by the Adani group in 2022.\"\n\n*Investigation Findings*\n\nThe OCCRP investigation has further revealed that a UAE-based secretive firm named Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited owned by Vinod Adani, brother of Gautam Adani and member of Adani promoter group, had received over $1.4 million in “advisory” fees from management companies of EIFF, EMRF and GOF between June 2012 and August 2014. The investigators have not only dug up invoices and transaction records, but also internal emails which suggest that EIFF, EMRF and GOF were investing funds into the Adani group stocks at the behest of Excel Investment and Advisory Services Limited, that is, Vinod Adani.\n\nTherefore, there is now prima facie evidence that entities like EIFF, EMRF and GOF were/are fronts through which Vinod Adani has invested massive funds into Adani group companies stocks. If one adds the shareholding of Vinod Adani in three Adani companies — through offshore individuals and entities like Nasser Ali and Chang Chung-Ling via EIFF, EMRF and GOF, with the disclosed promoter group shareholding of those companies — the promoter group shareholding of Adani Enterprises and Adani Transmission stood at over 78% in January 2017. This would be in clear breach of the 75% threshold contained in 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules.\n\nThe OCCRP evidence is over and above the ones already provided by the Hindenburg report which alleged a vast global web of tax haven based shell companies run by Vinod Adani through individuals like Chang Chung-Ling and offshore funds such as EIFF, EMRF etc. If more shell companies and transactions are investigated, it could further reveal breaches and contraventions of rules and regulations by the Adani group via the Vinod Adani channel.",
