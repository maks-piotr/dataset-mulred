        "Some of these govt brats are absolutely unbearable, there is one kid(17-20) who comes to my gym , whose father is a retired IPS officer , one day some uncle waved him of a bit rudely for some reason or the other and he made a whole big ruckus threatening him with whatnot and even started calling people up , thankfully his father also goes to the same gym and the staff know him well so they were able to calm him down , but fair to say everyone present at the time was quite shocked . After this everyone just keeps a basic distance from him and no other incidents have occurred.",
        "I remember when I was 16-17 I was in my father's office, he was a used car dealer, he was 52-53 yo that time. So some MLA guy came, he had a white Innova with an Indian Gov sticker, he wanted to buy a car for his son, his son was with him and was literally like 18-19 something, looked very fat and someone who hasn't taken a shower in years. That dude was literally calling my dad \"Tu\" the whole time, that MLA guy was talking with my dad with respect but his kid was a fucking spoiled brat, he was like \"ae tu mujhe ye gadi ka price bata, ae idhar aa Zara iska kya price kya ha?, Tu kabse ye business kar raha ha?\". His tone was so off I literally felt like punching him in his face. I also remember he saw a SUV which was like 12-15L something which his dad wanted to buy for him and said I don't want such cheap shit, I want a BMW or something, his dad said no we will buy something in range of 10-12L and then we will get you a blackberry phone.",
