        "Watching Lucifer. Abandoned after S2",
        "'Monster' Anime. Unlike other anime which are set mostly in fantasy or sci fi world, this one is grounded in reality. Really great so far.",
        "This is such a good anime. Its slow paced but one of my favorite animes. Such great character building and life in East Germany beautifully portrayed. Also cinematography is just awesome.",
        "Watching Defending Jacob with a 3 month free subscription of Apple TV+. Pretty decent so far",
        "Appan \n\nMalayalam movie released on Sony LIV. \n\nA family drama elevated by superb performances. \n\nThere is no such thing called bad people getting better in the end.\n\nFelt like watching the struggles of a family with own eyes, that's what makes cinematography best rather than cinematic shots.\n\nYou won't regret watching this movie.\n\nJust gone through dubbed versions of movie, it's better to watch the movie in Malayalam with English subtitles.",
        "Watched super deluxe it's soo good..Really liked altered carbon season 1 rewatching it also.",
        "Watching IWTV. So good. \n\nAlso, watched School of Good and Evil. It is very ridiculous, but good enough fun.",
        "Watching BETTER CALL SAUL!! What a series , Awesome dialogue delivery by BOB ODENKIRK.. \nI agree they should have  wrap the whole in 4 seasons but still I never feel bored watching it.",
        "Watching Mob Psycho III and Chainsaw Man. Also House of the Dragon but got some catching up to do there. Planning to watch the new season on Indian Predator on Netflix.",
        "Been wanting to watch this for so long. Will get to it someday",
        "There is a Paki movie \"Legend of Maula Jatt\" which has recently released and became the highest ever grossing movie there (starring Fawad Khan of Kapoor &amp; sons). Any chance it will come in India?",
        "Never",
        "How is Sunny Wayne?",
        "About to finish season 1 of The Sopranos . Liking it so far.\n\nNeed something to watch. \n\nI have watched recently: Primal, Cobra Kai, Banshee, The Boys, GoT and HoTD S1, all MCU Shows except for She Hulk. All mcu netflix shows except for Jessica Jones s2 s3 and the punisher s2.",
