    "selftext": "I got work from home and moved to a small town.\nThe people here are starving for jobs and most jobs are menial.\nThe idea of working online, freelancing and working for foreign comanies is alien and not even thought of here.\nPeople here somehow have honours degrees with zero knowledge or capabilities that a college passout would naturally develop.\n\nThe reason for the post:\nI recently learned that my relatives think I don't work, the talk became more frequent when I bought necessities like a bike and a cycle. They think my dad bought me thos as that is what happens here with people who have some money,my dad has always taught us to make our own money and only gave us what was necessary.\n\nI haven't said a word and not going to either.\nThese people could have just asked but the issue is I have told them however they don't understand it and even after being told they go around discussing with other relatives about places I can work at for literally a very small fraction of what I currently make.\nI don't show off, I wear ragged clothes and live like everyone here I eat rice and dal everyday but because I am capable I make myself a pizza or cake at home. People here seem to think if someone has money they should show off by buying big cars, I invest my money and buy things that remain in my house and I have zero desire to show people any of it.\nPeople here make 5k a month, why would I show off and make someone look small.\nI intentionally avoid the talk of how much I make by saying I make enough.\nPeople here have way too much time on their hands and waste it with social arguments over non sense things.\nThe aversion to change is next level.\n\nI am still happy with my decision to leave the city (Delhi) and move here with significantly cleaner air, lots of cool  natural places to hike and ride my bike to.\n\nother idiosyncrasies: \n\n1. The exploitation I see here is also next level. People that know basic things use that to make money from people for e.g. filling forms and taking them to the office to deposit the form.\n\n2. Another thing is the danger of credit, people making 2 to 2.5L p.a. are buying bikes worth 3L on long high interest emis with no investment other than fd and what's in the bank.\n\n3. Business that have all but disappeared from cities are thriving here at the moment. People who have money keep opening businesses and pay 2-3k to people for the jobs that pay atleast 7-8k in small cities.\n\n4. Someone tried to teach the people to seperate organic waste from non organic and people here didn't accept it. The guy had to hire people to do the sorting and eventually gave up now the people throw trash on empty lots and every now and then set fire to it.\nThey think I am crazy because i take my trash to the trash depot a few kilometres away.\n\nI could go on forever but I will stop here.\nI hope it was a good read.\n\nP.s.\nThought I would include some images.",

The focus should be learning not cramming.\n\nI know a English Hons student that knows nothing about anything he is reading but will still clear the exams and get an hons. This person will gain the respect for having an hons but when is sent to the city or applies for a government job, do you think they will get it? And if they do, that is bad for the community he is sent to uplift.\n\nThis is Bengal but these bengalis have forgotten Swami Vivekananda words.

How can you expect individuals in a confined geographical setting, who, as per your observations, likely haven't ventured beyond it for most of their lives, to possess a wealth of life experiences?\n\nThis post appears to adopt a moral high ground, portraying those in small towns as worthless or narrow-minded. The truth is, they've crafted their lives based on their constrained experiences. When it comes to hygiene and waste management, Delhi might not be the exemplar other towns or cities should emulate. Moreover, Delhites don't exactly enjoy the best reputation nationwide, negating the credibility of such admonitions.",

        "Recipe: It's the one on every Indian YT channel. I add an egg and butter to the recipes so need to knead more and add a bit more flour. I put whatever I have in the fridge like corn or keema as the stuffing and sometimes left over Chinese. All that with ozzy cheese of course. I always have per-prepared garlic butter.\n\nIt's a small town earlier the economy was based on sales tax but after GST a massive disruption happened and now business is the main reason for economic growth along with a regular inflow of parents and students that come for coaching for the JNVST exams which creates income from rent. Farming is still a big part but doesn't generate enough money for the people.\n\nThere is no caste issue as such, we have majority Hindus, Christians come in a close second. There are primarily tribes here that people often refer to instead of religion but not what you would think when I say tribe, they are normal looking people living like regular folks but when festivals come they celebrate them slightly different and sing tribal songs with tribal dance.\n\nTribes have intermixed as well now, a decade ago it created a fuss but now it's all good no one even bats an eye.\n\nThis place is awesome especially if you are into nature, bird watching and activities like hiking. This place made me realize how you don't need much to live life and feel fulfilled. Families feast together, go on picnics with homemade food which is something I missed a lot living alone in Delhi.\n\nThis is an awesome environment with some flaws as mentioned in the post.",

I am still happy with my decision to leave the city (Delhi) and move here with significantly cleaner air, lots of cool natural places to hike and ride my bike to. other idiosyncrasies: 1. The exploitation I see here is also next level. People that know basic things use that to make money from people for e.g. filling forms and taking them to the office to deposit the form. 2. Another thing is the danger of credit, people making 2 to 2.5L p.a. are buying bikes worth 3L on long high interest emis with no investment other than fd and what's in the bank. 3.

They'll randomly keep their shop or stall closed one day just cuz they didn't feel like or there was some relatives' function. You can't expect your work to be done in time. I have lots of cousins here, we hang out. I go on bike rides and hikes all the time so that occupies a lot of my time. I am an introvert so I don't require much to satisfy that social metre. No one I would call a friend but I have relatives I talk to daily but they are old and cannot be categorised as friends. I talk on the phone with my friend and visit every now and then. I see. Thanks for answering. Cheers and enjoy the shit out of your current life!! I moved here because I have relatives here, a house and land otherwise I would have endured Delhi. I actually like the 4c temps in Delhi, I like to get cosy and work. After the work is done I make stuffed garlic bread and enjoy it with hot tea. Good ol winter day in my small apartment. Those memories will be cherished for life. Yep agreed observed those things here as well. Among the most peculiar are medical stores closing and the lack of doctors. Here almost everything closes in the afternoons because people go home to eat and sleep. This was hilarious to me when I first came here and observed complete silence. Thanks. Will soon be growing some of my own veggies. Already own cows, goats and chickens. The taste is completely different from what I used to get in cities. Amrood k pedh se aam nhi milte Indian society is facing a constipation problem. Situations here are sticky. You can't change that. Not even those problems which are in just their minds. Wah kya baat kahi hai. But yaha apply nahi hoti. Describing an experience here. The experience of city boy moving to a small town. Not expecting city life here I have had enough of that. Wow ðŸ˜² >A very clear section of people that are called to do cleaning work like cleaning drains and sanitation tanks. Many don't let them in the house and give them water in a bathing mug. -When one of them goes up in economic status they get hate and are reminded \"where they came from\". All of this isn't subtle but done openly and is seen as acceptable. That's clearly caste discrimination going on there. Even if outcasts improve their economic status, they still face discrimination. Not surprising, casteism is endemic in our small towns and villages. *Another thing is the danger of credit, people making 2 to 2.5L p.a. are buying bikes worth 3L on long high interest emis with no investment other than fd and what's in the bank.* This happens in lot of places, not limited to rural areas. hey op, can I hijack your DM if you don't mind? Yes I guess that's right. I didn't have many people I knew who were like this, most were financially literate. I knew some colleagues that were always out of money.. A debt spiral will be deadly here no way to make more money unlike in cities. Although I must say I wrote the whole point wrong. I meant to say that people are being given lots of credit without any safeguards. People with no source of income are being handed credit cards which was strange to witness. I know this is obvious but let me emphasize it - if your salary is a lot higher than others around you then just shut the fuck up and try your best to blend in. Dont let their assumptions get to you and spill the truth. I donâ€™t know about bengal but things can be bad in bihar if they have a good idea about how much you earn. Lol i regret choosing a course which wont give me wfh oppurtunities Share your recipe for garlic bread. Btw, is this a village or small town/kheda? Do people of different castes live in same village or different villages? Education is the only solution That is what the problem is. *All the wealth of the world cannot help one little Indian village if the people are not taught to help themselves. Our work should be mainly educational, both moral and intellectual. - Swami Vivekananda* Private schools that teach nothing and behave like government schools. Government school with no teachers. Teacher that don't show up till 11 AM and then leave by 12 noon, ask that everyone come to their tuition centers. As a result the poor are left behind and eventually drop out. The education board here is more interested in showing off than real education, they create ridiculous syllabus which leads to cramming and then cut most of the syllabus when exams arrive, idiotic! The focus should be learning not cramming. I know a English Hons student that knows nothing about anything he is reading but will still clear the exams and get an hons. This person will gain the respect for having an hons but when is sent to the city or applies for a government job, do you think they will get it? And if they do, that is bad for the community he is sent to uplift. This is Bengal but these bengalis have forgotten Swami Vivekananda words. People here are desperate for teachers for their kids and many ask me to teach their kids. I believe things will improve slowly as even though there is a lack of opportunity and infrastructure to study properly the will is there. WFH is awesome but has it's downsides. They are slowly raising the productivity requirements which were already 20 percent higher than wfo. They are talking about 12 hours work day everywhere, I dropped my last employer because they did it and without raising the compensation. I work more for less pay? how does that compute? With the new employer I am here rumblings of the same. I am looking at alternate things I can do, I used to freelance and still do but it is very unstable. Why are you so bothered by what people think about you? Let them say whatever they want. You do whatever you want to do. These people want to live in their ignorant, little world. Let them. Its not your job to educate people especially if you have already tried and they have not responded favourably. Were you coerced into relocating to a small town? I presume not. It was your decision, and every choice carries consequences. How can you expect individuals in a confined geographical setting, who, as per your observations, likely haven't ventured beyond it for most of their lives, to possess a wealth of life experiences? This post appears to adopt a moral high ground, portraying those in small towns as worthless or narrow-minded. The truth is, they've crafted their lives based on their constrained experiences. When it comes to hygiene and waste management, Delhi might not be the exemplar other towns or cities should emulate. Moreover, Delhites don't exactly enjoy the best reputation nationwide, negating the credibility of such admonitions. Very interesting read. Thanks for posting. >casteism is endemic in our small towns and villages. in cities as well, let's not discount that ok. In villages and small towns it's in your face whereas in cities, it is subtle, which is even worse imo. Cannot help you with how you perceive things. These were just observations, experiences and contrast in societal structures and behaviours. Didn't complain or say that I expected this or that. At no point did I say small towns were \"worthless\" but yes narrow mindedness is a reality here. Waste management doesn't exists here and that too was to show the narrow mindedness and the lack of willingness to change. You should really read the post again and not draw your own inferences. I request you to take the post for what it is and don't overthink it. Yes that's true and that's why I wrote \"I haven't said a word and not going to either.\" I mind my own business and help ones that seek it. My pleasure. Happy to hear you enjoyed it. That's the right way to go. Recipe: It's the one on every Indian YT channel. I add an egg and butter to the recipes so need to knead more and add a bit more flour. I put whatever I have in the fridge like corn or keema as the stuffing and sometimes left over Chinese. All that with ozzy cheese of course. I always have per-prepared garlic butter. It's a small town earlier the economy was based on sales tax but after GST a massive disruption happened and now business is the main reason for economic growth along with a regular inflow of parents and students that come for coaching for the JNVST exams which creates income from rent. Farming is still a big part but doesn't generate enough money for the people. There is no caste issue as such, we have majority Hindus, Christians come in a close second. There are primarily tribes here that people often refer to instead of religion but not what you would think when I say tribe, they are normal looking people living like regular folks but when festivals come they celebrate them slightly different and sing tribal songs with tribal dance. Tribes have intermixed as well now, a decade ago it created a fuss but now it's all good no one even bats an eye. This place is awesome especially if you are into nature, bird watching and activities like hiking. This place made me realize how you don't need much to live life and feel fulfilled. Families feast together, go on picnics with homemade food which is something I missed a lot living alone in Delhi. This is an awesome environment with some flaws as mentioned in the post. What I'm getting at is, they never really got that shot to be better. For most, the privilege to pack up and hit the big cities, broaden their horizons, is just out of reach. And even for the few who manage it, they often bid farewell. But here's the twistâ€”beyond the bulk of negative observations, there's a real beauty to the small-town vibe. The sense of community, the laidback pace, and the sheer gift of pristine air and waterâ€”those are the uncelebrated gems that make small-town life special. Interesting read. May I ask what your long term plan is? I live here now. I think I didn't do a good job, I have relatives here and family. I plan to travel accross India on a bike and a bicycle to fully utilise my wfh aa long as I have it, probably a few years. If I am able to successfully execute the plan I have I can quit my job and travel. > For most, the privilege to pack up and hit the big cities, broaden their horizons, is just out of reach. Mate everyone has that opportunity. Have you met Biharis? Their state is a mess so many Biharis just up and leave because they can, **it's not a privilege**. Many people do it , it's about desire and willingness. &#x200B; > The sense of community, the laid back pace, and the sheer gift of pristine air and waterâ€”those are the uncelebrated gems that make small-town life special. Yes. I know. That is why I left the city. This is why I keep writing, read the post again. This is literally what I wrote : \" *I am still happy with my decision to leave the city (Delhi) and move here with significantly cleaner air, lots of cool natural places to hike and ride my bike to.* \" P.s. I recently started reading Resurrection. What do you think of Dostoevsky? took me some time but I started enjoying his writings after a few months. Also any new books from recent years you would recommend? I am having trouble finding anything I enjoy other than sci-fi books, Ted Chiang being the main writer I keep an eye out for. Wtf my puppy doing their. Yup in Bihar they might kidnap you and marry their daughter to you at gun point. You're giving sachiv ji vibes from panchayat ,ðŸ˜…. Literally panchayat web series ki yaad agyi isko padhne ke baad Is this Dooars?"
