        "Croupier - Clive Owen plays a croupier who repeats that he doesn't gamble but makes questionable decisions in real life throughout the film. Good film. 3.5/5\n\nNomadland - It is a film about the Nomad culture in USA. It has many people playing themselves in the film. Frances Mcdormand is brilliant and the supporting cast do a really good job despite being non-actors. An extremely heartfelt experience of a film 4/5.\n\nThe Kid Detective - Enjoyable thriller comedy. It is pretty funny in bits. The lead, Adam Brody, does a very convincing job. 3.5/5\n\nThe Pledge - Jack Nicholson plays a cop investigating a case on his own after retirement. It also seems to be about loneliness and family. Decent film 3.5/5\n\nNocturnal Animals - I definitely will recommend this film. This is one of the films that really made sense to me in all its symbolism. Great performances by Jake Gyllenhall and Amy Adams. 4/5\n\nThe Father - This film hit me really hard, on a personal level because of my experience with patients of dementia and Alzheimers. Anthony Hopkins does a fantastic job in this film. 4.5/5.",

Just don't generalize 4 different industries which are different from each other and call them they don't have realistic touch when you haven't even watched them.",

        "Is it about planned obsolescence? Sounds like it.",
        "Nocturnal Animals tells a story in the most powerful way we can all understand, as a story. It's a meta story. A story of a guy telling his life story as an analogy through his novel. The ending of the movie is fucking brilliant and the soundtrack is outstanding! Beautiful cinematography and great acting too.",

        "Thank you for the compliment. No, I am not a doctor. I have had Alzheimers and Dementia in my family.",
        "Yeah. It builds up to what looks like a cop vs villain showdown then it becomes something else. It takes the audience by surprise though and connects the opening scene to that ending. It all does make sense at the end.",
        "Is Stand By Me the film where the kids pool their pocket money and pay a hooker to show them her bare breasts? And then they have cigarette after that. I remember this scene from a film but cannot place it. It was years ago that I saw this scene and I was very young then.",
        "Jerry also has this desperate need to prove himself (to perhaps himself only) right.\n\nHe finds a loving woman and child when he clearly is lonely and in need for love. But that is not what he can appreciate or want. Perhaps that is why his previous marriages failed.\n\nAlthough he loves the little girl, he kind of uses her as a bait. And even though it is not proven for sure that there indeed was a bogeyman, Jerry's quest for the bogeyman is very real. It consumes him. He obviously goes crazy in that quest.\n\nJust rambling.",
        "I'm sorry I don't remember the nuances from the movie since I watched it over a decade ago. But I do remember that he uses the girl as bait and her mom asks him to fuck off. Also the serial killer who is never revealed definitely dies on the way to the location. His car burns up or something like that if I can remember it correctly. There's definitely a killer on the loose but his death brings out the glaring lack of human collection in the cops life. Ramble on my friend. That's an interesting movie. Such movies are rare. Subversion of audience's expectations!",
        "Yeah there are definite strong hints at a character who could probably be the killer and dies in an auto accident. And our protagonist is much too fixated on finding him. Drives him crazy. Makes me think what should one focus more on life.\n\nIncidentally, Sean Penn's another film Into the Wild is also about a quest of a man to live off nature, independently. Although very different films some similarities in the main character. No?",
        "Into the Wild, I watched many times. I love that movie. It's based on a real person who died of starvation alone in the wild, Chris McCandless. It's a rational look at how traveling is great and how it can also come with its own drawbacks if you're not prepared for it.",
        "Mccandless finds several loving and caring people throughout his journey. Some give him a job and others want to make him a part of their family. Although he is seeking something else.",
        "Yup.",
        "Yeah. Watched the whole thing. Planned obsolescence was taught in MBA. It broke my heart. They talk about profits but just think about the materials being wasted. That's so fucked up. Some people lose their lives to collect and gather various materials for say the iPhone and they ensure that the phone doesn't last long. That's messed up."

I need something like curb or Seinfeld Have already watched arrested development Watched The Great Indian Kitchen. Fantastic movie. No one can make movies like Malayalam industry. Hard hitting realistic. Great take on patriarchal society, women treated as second class citizens. Watch Uncommon Sense with Saloni Gaur( Sony LIV/ YouTube) for a satirical take on the issues being faced in India You could watch its always sunny in philadelphia. Community is a goood shout too. Curb/seinfeld are as good as comedy gets. Havent seen anything which could top those shows. If you are into british comedies, i would suggest peep show/ the it crowd. Will check it out Watched always Sunny, it crowd, community Will check out peer show Not exactly a comedy, but entourage is a good watch as well in case you havent seen it. Beautiful Anonymous is a podcast hosted by this chill guy, who has 1 hour phone conversations with anonymous people that confess things about their lives and they can have either really wholesome or really tragic endings. The stories can get really weird/funny and they‚Äôre nice to listen to when grocery shopping or going on a walk. I‚Äôve had to keep myself from laughing in public and sometimes the stories stop you in your tracks. The one I listened to recently was about a woman who grew up with parents who are psychic and how that affected her childhood...Thank god I don‚Äôt have psychic parents. Love entourage, It's a very chill show . Where is it available? Any recommendations on series with light 20-min comedies? Watched The Office and re-run of Seinfeld lately. Stressing on 20 mins as it is a good enough break during the work day. Barry - dark comedy Check out the Canadian tv series \"Schitt's Creek\". One of the best light comedies I have watched. Anyone watch Angie Tribeca on Prime Video? I think it's funny. Gives me the feels of Monty Python. Schitt's Creek is a great show. Be sure to check it out. Thanks - have heard a lot about it. Will try it out. Will do! Thanks! I read that the first couple of seasons aren't as good. The later ones are awesome and won the Emmys. What was your experience like? Thanks - will explore them. That 70's show, Entourage, After life Honestly i like all the seasons pretty much but ya the last couple of seasons is when the show really shines. I had a lot of fun watching it. Recently watched the movie \"Run\" by Aneesh Chaganty. It was a really good film imo but nothing compared to his previous film \"Searching\". Do check out these two movies. I advise watching \"Run\" first and then watch \"Searching\". You will then understand what a masterpiece \"Searching\" is. This man showed how to create great movies even with low budgets. Brooklyn Nine Nine Here‚Äôs the link for it. If you scroll down you can see there‚Äôs a Full Episode List and it shows you all the stories to choose from. Enjoy! Rona hai weekend pe to 1. Incendies. 2. 12 years a slave Finished the last episode of Resident alien yesterday and it was a great new show.Also watched the new episode of Falcon and the winter soldier.Would also recommend watching 'What we do in the Shadows' if you wanna watch comedy. Have you watched what we do in the shadows? It's become my new favorite comedy show. Where can i watch Seinfeld ? It's on prime - will have to use VPN. Couldn't agree more about the Malayalam cinema part. I lost all hopes for our movie industry with the garbage that bollywood was putting out. After watching 'jalikattu' and 'ee.maa.yau' , my faith was restored. I've been watching 'The Boys' it's great, one of the most interesting series I've watched in a while. Also, I watched Mean Streets yesterday decent movie if anyone wants to check it out. Saw Mcmafia ( based on some jurno book ) and CB Strike ( based on JK Rowling novel) . Both were quite awesome. Line of Duty is another awesome miniseries . Season 6 going on as of now . First 2 episodes were quite good . Just subscribed, will listen. Thanks for a unique suggestion. Veep. You can watch it on Hotstar. Ted Lasso.. Just watched G vs K , in Cinepolis , hardly 15 people were there Mcmafia was interesting but, still waiting for second season. watch, Amend: The Fight for America on netflix , powerful docu series , the stark reality of how India is in fact going in reverse will hit hard. and oh yeah Line of duty of netflix is awesome it's a wonder that i missed this gem for years. Watch Flower of Evil on Netflix. One of the best thriller,suspense k-drama. Irul (Malayalam) was a decent fresh thriller, gorgeously looking too. New sci-fi recommendation- Made for Love #restorethesnyderverse loved the snyder cut. especially flight 2.0 and flash's scene are cbm legends for me boys s2 was a letdown Try community, it's by Dan Harmon (co creator of Rick and Morty although nothing like it) No, south movies have the worst pacing but yeah great cinematography. Thanks for the heads up It was meh... Yeah they don't have realistic touch. They somehow integrated women empowerment in that too... Lol it was the most fun I had from a CBM since infinity war. Community, silicon valley Didn't understand everything but it was okay. It is a heavy watch tbh. 1. The namesake (Irrfan Khan) 2. It's a beautiful life. (Short movie by an Oscar winner) 3. Stand by me. All three of them are really terrific watch I guess since joker has set such a high bar, I'll be disappointed with all these heavy VFX movies... * Fleabag * Derry Girls * Santa Clarita Diet If you like documentaries check out: Making a Dictator (Removed from Hotstar) [10 years with Hayao Miyazaki](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/program/video/10yearshayaomiyazaki/). You can watch it for free on this site, the official site btw. A look at the iconic director's working style and creative process. It isn't. I liked s2 more. Which platform is this on? The first season is a bit slow and the show takes some time to find its legs. Post that its amazing. Very heartfelt and surprisingly entertaining. Does anybody know how can I access old sitcoms like Frasier, Taxi, etc. I would not want to use torrent if possible Watching -Falcon and The Winter Soldier -godzilla vs kong -anime movies like(your name, weathering with you, the silent voice), underrated guys you should try these Nah man s02 was great, always decide for yourself if a show is good or not cause everyone has their own tastes Apple TV+ Which streaming service has these animes ? 9anime.to or any 9anime sites... You will find all anime tv series and movies there in good quality Thanks.. For the anime fans \"My Hero Academia\" is back with Season 5. Where did you watch it? Available on Amazon prime and Neestream Godzilla vs Kong was lot of fun. Then i saw Wonder Woman 84. That was NOT much fun. That's weird, s2 was great Thanks for the link! After Attack on Titan season 4 part-I , I couldn't resist and read rest of the manga chapters. Isayama üôè Torrent Schitt's Creek The Inbetweeners if you like/wanna try British Comedies Croupier - Clive Owen plays a croupier who repeats that he doesn't gamble but makes questionable decisions in real life throughout the film. Good film. 3.5/5 Nomadland - It is a film about the Nomad culture in USA. It has many people playing themselves in the film. Frances Mcdormand is brilliant and the supporting cast do a really good job despite being non-actors. An extremely heartfelt experience of a film 4/5. The Kid Detective - Enjoyable thriller comedy. It is pretty funny in bits. The lead, Adam Brody, does a very convincing job. 3.5/5 The Pledge - Jack Nicholson plays a cop investigating a case on his own after retirement. It also seems to be about loneliness and family. Decent film 3.5/5 Nocturnal Animals - I definitely will recommend this film. This is one of the films that really made sense to me in all its symbolism. Great performances by Jake Gyllenhall and Amy Adams. 4/5 The Father - This film hit me really hard, on a personal level because of my experience with patients of dementia and Alzheimers. Anthony Hopkins does a fantastic job in this film. 4.5/5. Parks and Recreation. &gt;Stand by me WIll check this out. I suspect I saw this film as a kid but don't remember it well. I watched this video on YT and thought of sharing it here.[https://youtu.be/j5v8D-alAKE](https://youtu.be/j5v8D-alAKE) This video is about stuff: light bulbs, printers, phones and why they aren't better. There's no such thing as South movies. There are 4 major south Indian languages Tell that after watching Kumbalangi Nights, Jallikattu, Ee Ma Yau, and other malayalam films surprised nobody's talking bout mr robot - fans upvote! one of the best shows ive watched. wdym? how do you think you're gonna find it if you don't use piracy? Yeah, definitely recommended to all the technology freak &gt; Nocturnal Animals Netflix or prime? Netflix It's wonderful. It striked me as something pure amidst all BS going on. The ending really ties the movie together. Is the last season worth it?? I'm really in a depression phase and don't wanna see anything too much dark. Nocturnal animals is my favourite movie. I have watched it so many times. It doesn't paints all artists as fake and hits really hard. I haven't watched the rest of the movies In your list. Thanks for the recommendation. You seem like a really genuine guy. Are you a doctor?? I'm waiting for all seasons to finish. Utna padhne ki himmat nhi hai... Also waiting for one punch man season 3. Telegram maybe but you'll have to search a lot. Ab zindagi mein aur darkness nhi chahiye. Science ka koi na koi bright side to hona chahiye future mein. Arrival dekhne mein kafi maja aaya tha. Hope is a good thing. Youtube spoilers were all over bhai. Raha nahi gaya padh liya. But is really amazing. Last chapter will be coming this week. Ya same waiting for one punch man S3. I couldn't get myself to watch them. The pace seems slightly high in South indian movies. But maybe they take some time to grow over you. Also I'm north indian so they are less relatable to me. Idk. I've downloaded incendies. Denis Villeneuve par poora bharosa hai. Podcast: Algorithm. The episode with Rationalist Narendra Nayak in which he discussed about receiving death threats and losing friends like Gauri Lankesh and Narendra Dabholkar to murders. [Algorithm Podcast- Narendra Nayak](https://youtu.be/5HZ-NUWsxtg) if anything, it will make you stronger bro. try to understand the message behind it tho. Our children's future is doomed bro. Welcome to the party! What does pace is slightly high mean? Not all movies are the same. And which movie did you even try to watch? It's okay if you don't watch them. Just don't generalize 4 different industries which are different from each other and call them they don't have realistic touch when you haven't even watched them. I can't get over just how good The Office is. &gt; Altered Carbon (Season 1 was good, Season 2 could have been better but didn't disappoint) Both seasons start out very strong and toward the end of 2 I just couldn't take all the action etc. Would give anything for a slower-paced sci-fi /fantasy. Is it about planned obsolescence? Sounds like it. Nocturnal Animals tells a story in the most powerful way we can all understand, as a story. It's a meta story. A story of a guy telling his life story as an analogy through his novel. The ending of the movie is fucking brilliant and the soundtrack is outstanding! Beautiful cinematography and great acting too. I watched The Pledge long ago. The ending is depressing though. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It is sad but the whole film tied well together for me. Thank you for the compliment. No, I am not a doctor. I have had Alzheimers and Dementia in my family. Yeah. It builds up to what looks like a cop vs villain showdown then it becomes something else. It takes the audience by surprise though and connects the opening scene to that ending. It all does make sense at the end. Is Stand By Me the film where the kids pool their pocket money and pay a hooker to show them her bare breasts? And then they have cigarette after that. I remember this scene from a film but cannot place it. It was years ago that I saw this scene and I was very young then. Jerry also has this desperate need to prove himself (to perhaps himself only) right. He finds a loving woman and child when he clearly is lonely and in need for love. But that is not what he can appreciate or want. Perhaps that is why his previous marriages failed. Although he loves the little girl, he kind of uses her as a bait. And even though it is not proven for sure that there indeed was a bogeyman, Jerry's quest for the bogeyman is very real. It consumes him. He obviously goes crazy in that quest. Just rambling. I'm sorry I don't remember the nuances from the movie since I watched it over a decade ago. But I do remember that he uses the girl as bait and her mom asks him to fuck off. Also the serial killer who is never revealed definitely dies on the way to the location. His car burns up or something like that if I can remember it correctly. There's definitely a killer on the loose but his death brings out the glaring lack of human collection in the cops life. Ramble on my friend. That's an interesting movie. Such movies are rare. Subversion of audience's expectations! Yeah there are definite strong hints at a character who could probably be the killer and dies in an auto accident. And our protagonist is much too fixated on finding him. Drives him crazy. Makes me think what should one focus more on life. Incidentally, Sean Penn's another film Into the Wild is also about a quest of a man to live off nature, independently. Although very different films some similarities in the main character. No? Into the Wild, I watched many times. I love that movie. It's based on a real person who died of starvation alone in the wild, Chris McCandless. It's a rational look at how traveling is great and how it can also come with its own drawbacks if you're not prepared for it. Mccandless finds several loving and caring people throughout his journey. Some give him a job and others want to make him a part of their family. Although he is seeking something else. Yup. Yeah. Watched the whole thing. Planned obsolescence was taught in MBA. It broke my heart. They talk about profits but just think about the materials being wasted. That's so fucked up. Some people lose their lives to collect and gather various materials for say the iPhone and they ensure that the phone doesn't last long. That's messed up."
