I'm sure that this isn't breaking news for seasoned salespeople in this country. I personally have gone through something like this since the start of my sales career some 7 years ago. And I've always been in B2B sales which is considered more respectable generally. \n\nSo it is time to name and shame our current and previous organizations that allow for this kind of behaviour. \n\nI'll go first:\n\nNo surprises here - Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited\n\nAbsolutely terrible work culture. 6 days a week to start with. Bosses are terrible from top to bottom. You are treated like a number not a person. HR is non existent. During my tenure at Jio, I heard from HR only once, during my training days. \n\nThe shouting that you see in the HDFC video - that was daily life for me. My manager used to threaten us with salary holds and PIPs and terminations daily. I had to start keeping track of the PIP threats. He was averaging 5/6 per day. \n\nAs for the shouting - he had rage issues. He shouted at our B2B clients. I mean then why would he hold back on his team. \n\nIf there is anyone looking to join Reliance Jio - do yourself a favour, don't.",

        ">If there is anyone looking to join Reliance Jio - do yourself a favour, don't.\n\n++++\n\nOr if you are a CA, join and get a crazy good package and use that to join elsewhere. \n\nCan vouch for what OP says about shouting, it happened even during the pandemic, it is pathetic.\n\nOn that note, there have been some RIL employees who legit died at work or while being on call with their team/boss. The pressure is insane and they try to jugaad for a looooong time rather than say buying new tech.",
        ">RIL employees who legit died at work or while being on call with their team/boss.\n\nWhat? Is there a case filed?",
        "No, but that did lead to some bosses asking people not to attend work calls when they are out of the office.  \n\n\nI know 2 such cases, but those were before the pandemic. One was at RCP itself.  \n\n\nThe yelling and gaali galoch is super common though. This relative of mine has lots of stories like op mentioned. Some people in the upper management have a very foul mouth and they use really very bad words, sometimes even in front of other employees.",
        "Yea it's a top down thing. My manager used to get shouted at like that by his manager. His manager also got shouted at the same way. All the way to the top. The only difference is the frequency. \n\nFor us it was multiple times daily. For some its weekly. For some monthly.

Plus we would get paid OT allowances and comp offs even for a couple of hours of over time. I had earned so many comp offs that by the time I left TCS I had 50+ earned leaves and I could encash them all.",

        "adidas India Marketing Private Ltd.! \n\nLet's delve into the cesspool of toxic boss culture and their questionable hiring practices. I mean, seriously, who in their right mind thinks it's a good idea to hire people from higher positions and place them in lower positions? Talk about demoralizing and squashing any hopes of internal promotions!\n\nAnd let's not forget about their amazing decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the rest of the world was struggling, they thought it would be a brilliant idea to extend the working week from five days to six! Oh, because revenue and staff were limited, right? Well, guess what? The backend team was still working five days a week. Way to prioritize and create a divide among your employees!!\n\nNow, let's talk about the fantastic response they had when you dared to voice your concerns. Did they take it as constructive feedback? Nope! Instead, they canceled your transfer and promotion, and to add insult to injury, they blacklisted you for any future transfers in any region! How's that for valuing employee opinions and fostering a supportive work environment?\n\nBut wait, there's more! When your team had the audacity to complain about the superboss in confidentiality, what did adidas India do? They retaliated and put the blame squarely on your shoulders! And what was the end result? They fired the Assistant Manager! Oh, how sweet of them, playing the role of the sweet-talking, overly caring snakes in the grass.\n\nAnd let's not forget their incredible commitment to diversity and inclusion. Instead of hiring the most qualified and experienced candidates, they blindly hire female staff to increase the women's percentage. Who cares about competence and expertise, right? It's all about the numbers and appearances, regardless of the impact it has on the overall team dynamics and productivity.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! adidas India Marketing Private Ltd., where toxic boss culture, questionable hiring practices, retaliation, and prioritizing numbers over talent are the name of the game.\n\nTL;DR: adidas India Marketing Private Ltd. has a toxic boss culture, questionable hiring practices, and retaliates against employees who voice concerns. They extended the working week during COVID-19, canceled promotions, blacklisted transfers, and fired my Assistant Manager. They also prioritize hiring relatively inexperienced women over experienced male candidates. Not a great place to work!",
        "I know I am going to get downvoted for sharing the reality here but still, \n\nIs this really the first time the majority of people are becoming aware of these situations ? Situations like these are very common in all types of sales and Service related jobs. If you have a family member or a relative who works in a sales job, ask them regarding this and you will get to know a lot of such situations which are never brought to light. \n\nThe best that can be is done by the employee is to ask for change of manager ? Why - Because if that one screaming manager can bring results and profits to the XYZ company or Bank, that way works and company benefits. So again the bank won't fire them until they start beating someone.\n\nLike think through once, why would a random number from XYZ bank call you asking if you want to take loans or credit cards or debit cards or sell you insurance every week or month ? These so-called callers mostly have a job where they are paid on the number of people they call in a day and if they don't meet that target, these callers will also be scolded by their managers. Some of them will be scammers as well, some we as people are careful off and sometimes people get scammed.\n\nSimilarly, You will also see many people in Malls or Electronic shops telling you to share contact numbers with them. Why are they asking this ? Because their managers have told them to take and note done numbers of people they talk to. These managers might also be screaming at them. Reports are made everyday, on field jobs have to send Checklist whether they have succeeded in completing the minimum quota of talking to people.\n\nI agree 80% of Managers are great and very helpful but you will also find others like the one in the videos. Even a good manager might scream at a person due to some frustration or other things. It is obviously wrong and mentally hurtful.",

They had access to every customers entire history (in fact I even made a post about this years ago) and they were asked to use this info to sell ULIP or prepaid (brokerage)\n\nThere was an extreme incident where a female RM was asked by the manager to go sleep with the client to get the sale. She recorded it and reported it and the manager was fired. \n\nThere were multiple incidents where if an RM hadn't met his commit, the manager would call him up at 7pm and ask them to travel to a branch on the other side of the city. Like say if they were in Navi Mumbai, they'd be asked to go to South Bombay and call the manager from there. Once they'd call the manager from there - the manager would ask them to go home. This was a daily tactic apparently. \n\nOther than this there were three commit calls that happened every day which were basically abuse. \n\nMy friend quit within one year and joined a consulting firm where the hours were much longer but no one ever treated him like a slave again.\n\nhttps://www.np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/59coxb/ashow_comfortable_are_you_knowing_that_many_bank/",

The starting pay is 12K and shifts are crazy. A lot of staff is older and who have been working at the same hotel and same position for decades and have a chip on their shoulders. That whole \"Aaj ke launde hame sikhange\". They forcefully take tips away from newbies and interns. Managers fucking eat in the restuarants themselves or would have banquet food but give the lower staff 15 minutes to go and have their meal ( which more often than not is shit). You may think chefs would get to make gourmet meals and shit but that's far from the reality, most of the times you're stuck peeling onion, carrot and doing basic mise en place and constantly face abuses from superiors. I remember this one intern who was in banquet service with me hadn't gotten a leave in 15 days and had gotten blisters on his feet. He just couldn't take it and said to hell with this and went home limping. The worst part is there is no fixed shift timings as well, you will do a morning shift on Monday which is like 7-5 and afternoon shift on Tuesday which is 2-11 and then do night shift on Wednesday.

And questions to the face aren't criticisms, news articles and OPEds are. PM isn't exactly controlling the press lol. You can either control the press or evade it, not both at same time.\n\nAlso, issues out of thin air? Somehow this feels like a weird criticism. He does make a mountain of a mole hill, sure. But Thin air?",
        "There is no such thing as \"fair share\" for pay. You will be paid your market value for your labour. Universal basic income is also not exactly fair share pay. It's a completely different logic of fair pay for survival in society. Again, no such thing as fair share of pay. \n\n>We are humans,\n\nJobs are also careers. Your logic applies only when you will  be in same job for your whole life. Nobody wants that without UBI which actually grows according to inflation, which it never does. Since we are in a country which is really really far away from UBI system, you have no choice if you want to build a career out of the job.",

Yearly hikes were an amazing 2-4% because of business slowdown (while execs kept raising stock prices). Neither you could switch because Auto sector is not that well paid.\n\nJust writing this makes my blood boil.

People nowadays don't respect bankers and even the hardworking staff bears the brunt of the prejudice. I had a GM literally say that those who do not have babies yet should refrain for next two years(his tenure) on the day he joined and this who have babies should find creche services coz everybody should forget that they have a family for next 2 years... He till date is the most hated boss I've come across, people worked 9-9 every day with no appreciation, would publicly slam people by saying free ki salary lene me sharam nahi aati, once he was at some conference where he would hand over the award for good performance and then say it loud you don't deserve this free ki salary le rahe ho sharam karo...

Let's go with the bad ones first:\n\nYours truly - IT consultant and general busy body who can talk multiple languages and weasel myself into talking to both low level as well as management folks. Worked on a lot of sarkaari IT projects.\n\nNIC/C-DAC and other state owned IT - crap pay for engineers, abusive managers, crap culture, ass kissing, bootlicking, nepotism, corruption, technology stuck 10-20 years behind. You will be surprised at the budgets these companies get and the payscales for management, and it is astounding any big project gets done at all. Hire some talented UI/UX designers you lazy, incompetent fuckers!\n\nIOB/SBI/Canara and all the chota PSB banks - the worst of the lot. fail to adapt to modern consumer needs and IT infra running on creaking old HW and software. The only gig where I actually wanted to climb into the old ancient HW and stick my neck into the huge ass fans and kill myself. 16 hour work days, abuse, psychological manipulation, psychopathic managers, overworked staff. Fixed cost projects spell DOOM! One manager actually physically assaulted an employee for typing in a wrong command that fucked up the network config. They keep posting non-native people to branches where most of the staff and customers do not speak the same language. I feel sorry for the Infys, TCS, HCLs and other services companies that have to work on these projects - it has failure written on them even before the project starts.\n\nThe good ones:\n\nYou may be surprised, or may be I just got lucky with these - YMMV:\n\nBEL Bangalore - chill as fuck 9-5 job, but 6 day work week. culture still stuck in the 1980s, but most of the old unkills have been forced to retire. No pressure to deliver anything, and they work on big complex products and projects. Ass kissing exists, but by and large they leave the employees alone. There are lot of women in leadership positions, maybe that;s why the culture is like this. Hire more women in management!\n\nISRO -  No suprise here. Culture used to be even better, but culture trickles down from the top. Mostly solid engineers in the top, and it tells. Surprisingly sophisticated for a sarkari company, but APJ and Seshan left a legacy of excellence and getting the job done.",

The Agency leadership was desperate on hold onto their careers and that's when such culture became widespread.\n\nFunnily, Agency has recovered recently and is doing well. A big reason for that was the new agency head, who cut down on the sales pressure and focused more on agent recruitment. Getting good quality agents turned out to be the key to becoming profitable.",

        " I am here to share my recent work experience in an edtech company, which unfortunately turned out to be quite disheartening and challenging. I believe it is important to express my thoughts and feelings in order to process and reflect upon the negative aspects of my time there.\n\nOne of the primary issues I encountered was the exceptionally long hours I was expected to work. The demands of the job often extended far beyond the typical 9-to-5 schedule, leaving me with little personal time or opportunities for rest and rejuvenation. This imbalance between work and personal life took a toll on my well-being and overall job satisfaction.\n\nMoreover, I had the misfortune of working under a manager who fostered a toxic work environment. Their constant shouting and aggressive demeanor created an atmosphere filled with tension and anxiety. The relentless pressure to achieve sales targets, coupled with the manager's unreasonable expectations, made it challenging to thrive in such an environment. It became increasingly difficult to maintain a positive mindset and motivation to excel when faced with such excessive stress.\n\nUnfortunately, the negative impact of these circumstances extended beyond my professional life, affecting my overall mental and emotional well-being. The constant barrage of pressure and hostility took a toll on my confidence and self-esteem, leaving me feeling devalued and demotivated. I left for good and thats been the best decision of my life.",

        "During one of my old jobs, my grandpa had died very unexpectedly. I told my boss that I would be gone Friday-Sunday for the funeral, since he lived in a different state. Sunday comes by, and it's clear by all the traffic and such that we wouldn't make it home until 10 AM at the earliest, since we drove. I texted my boss to tell him that I wouldn't make it until 10 AM on Monday instead of 7 AM on Monday. This somehow offended him as he sent a long angry text telling me that I had only requested Friday through Sunday off and how selfish and lazy I was for not telling him before that I would need Monday off. But he also made sure to mention that he wouldn't have given me Monday off anyway because several people had already gotten Monday off and he needed me in. I had to explain that it is physically impossible for me to get there on time. He told me to hurry up and come in anyway. I was very new to the workforce so I did. But because I couldn't sleep on the whole drive home I got very sick and passed out during work. He then fired me for not being \"professional\" enough or whatever. And this is quite strange to me because this was at a Mormon warehouse, the same people who claim to be the friendliest kind of people. \\[I would know, I grew up surrounded by Mormons\\]"

    "light_cleaned_title": "Expose your terrible bosses and organizations - a follow up to the HDFC video. A place to vent and share your story.",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "This video has gone viral. I'm sure that this isn't breaking news for seasoned salespeople in this country. I personally have gone through something like this since the start of my sales career some 7 years ago. And I've always been in B2B sales which is considered more respectable generally. So it is time to name and shame our current and previous organizations that allow for this kind of behaviour. I'll go first: No surprises here - Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited Absolutely terrible work culture. 6 days a week to start with. Bosses are terrible from top to bottom. You are treated like a number not a person. HR is non existent. During my tenure at Jio, I heard from HR only once, during my training days. The shouting that you see in the HDFC video - that was daily life for me. My manager used to threaten us with salary holds and PIPs and terminations daily. I had to start keeping track of the PIP threats. He was averaging 5/6 per day. As for the shouting - he had rage issues. He shouted at our B2B clients. I mean then why would he hold back on his team. If there is anyone looking to join Reliance Jio - do yourself a favour, don't.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": ">If there is anyone looking to join Reliance Jio - do yourself a favour, don't. ++++ Or if you are a CA, join and get a crazy good package and use that to join elsewhere. Can vouch for what OP says about shouting, it happened even during the pandemic, it is pathetic. On that note, there have been some RIL employees who legit died at work or while being on call with their team/boss. The pressure is insane and they try to jugaad for a looooong time rather than say buying new tech. >RIL employees who legit died at work or while being on call with their team/boss. What? Is there a case filed? No, but that did lead to some bosses asking people not to attend work calls when they are out of the office. I know 2 such cases, but those were before the pandemic. One was at RCP itself. The yelling and gaali galoch is super common though. This relative of mine has lots of stories like op mentioned. Some people in the upper management have a very foul mouth and they use really very bad words, sometimes even in front of other employees. Yea it's a top down thing. My manager used to get shouted at like that by his manager. His manager also got shouted at the same way. All the way to the top. The only difference is the frequency. For us it was multiple times daily. For some its weekly. For some monthly. But its the same. Thats why I feel all those \"Great Places To Work\" awards are a sham - every place I've worked at has had those awards ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Why was the case not filed? People legit lost their lives. Better to resign and lose a job than this. In such cases, the spouse is given some job position to sort of make up for the loss. So, the family doesn't bother filing any complaints. But the employees know though, they know and many will go out of their way to comfort people who get yelled at. What about rude behaviour by employees? I had a friend who joined tcs(bcom grad). 9-5 working hours. Had to punch out at 5 but still have to remain in office till 7pm. No overtime payment. Applying for leave, u won't get any of ur choice. U can take the leave on days we provide. While the managers used to come late by 10 and left at 5, all while taking 1-2 days leave every 7-8 working days. She left after 6 months. Why would anybody want to work for an employer who was responsible for their death? This is just disturbing. SAh was see s but stdg sa sa sa sa sazszx\"'ccrssddxgaasscssassssysssf zes s s dddd sa a CD CD CD zz*asszczs What are CAs paid there? Meow? It is, but many times the man is the sole breadwinner in the family. There's this family friend I know who had 6 dependents - wife+kids+parents (2)+uncle & aunt He looks after all of them 11-15LPA These toxic companies took advantage of their situation. Litigation could only cause more pain with no guarantee of winning as these companies would be able to hire the topmost lawyers. Can only name and shame but even media is not too bothered now-a-days. That is very true, sadly. Naming and shaming won't help and companies are very strict with employees' offline & digital presence now. Especially after the Janhavi Gadkar case. Funny thing here is HDFC acting as if they did not know any of these were happening and being all righteous. Internally they must be like phew only one video got out! Other banks - phew it was not one of ours! But in case of a company like Tcs, your work culture largely depends on your project and your manager. Their HR policies are pretty robust so as soon as any case reaches the HR it gets resolved in a pretty just way. I have worked there for a few yrs and luckily had the chillest boss. Plus we would get paid OT allowances and comp offs even for a couple of hours of over time. I had earned so many comp offs that by the time I left TCS I had 50+ earned leaves and I could encash them all. Vehicle Dealership especially Trucks are another hell holes. ICICI is way worse. adidas India Marketing Private Ltd.! Let's delve into the cesspool of toxic boss culture and their questionable hiring practices. I mean, seriously, who in their right mind thinks it's a good idea to hire people from higher positions and place them in lower positions? Talk about demoralizing and squashing any hopes of internal promotions! And let's not forget about their amazing decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the rest of the world was struggling, they thought it would be a brilliant idea to extend the working week from five days to six! Oh, because revenue and staff were limited, right? Well, guess what? The backend team was still working five days a week. Way to prioritize and create a divide among your employees!! Now, let's talk about the fantastic response they had when you dared to voice your concerns. Did they take it as constructive feedback? Nope! Instead, they canceled your transfer and promotion, and to add insult to injury, they blacklisted you for any future transfers in any region! How's that for valuing employee opinions and fostering a supportive work environment? But wait, there's more! When your team had the audacity to complain about the superboss in confidentiality, what did adidas India do? They retaliated and put the blame squarely on your shoulders! And what was the end result? They fired the Assistant Manager! Oh, how sweet of them, playing the role of the sweet-talking, overly caring snakes in the grass. And let's not forget their incredible commitment to diversity and inclusion. Instead of hiring the most qualified and experienced candidates, they blindly hire female staff to increase the women's percentage. Who cares about competence and expertise, right? It's all about the numbers and appearances, regardless of the impact it has on the overall team dynamics and productivity. So there you have it, folks! adidas India Marketing Private Ltd., where toxic boss culture, questionable hiring practices, retaliation, and prioritizing numbers over talent are the name of the game. TL;DR: adidas India Marketing Private Ltd. has a toxic boss culture, questionable hiring practices, and retaliates against employees who voice concerns. They extended the working week during COVID-19, canceled promotions, blacklisted transfers, and fired my Assistant Manager. They also prioritize hiring relatively inexperienced women over experienced male candidates. Not a great place to work! I know I am going to get downvoted for sharing the reality here but still, Is this really the first time the majority of people are becoming aware of these situations ? Situations like these are very common in all types of sales and Service related jobs. If you have a family member or a relative who works in a sales job, ask them regarding this and you will get to know a lot of such situations which are never brought to light. The best that can be is done by the employee is to ask for change of manager ? Why - Because if that one screaming manager can bring results and profits to the XYZ company or Bank, that way works and company benefits. So again the bank won't fire them until they start beating someone. Like think through once, why would a random number from XYZ bank call you asking if you want to take loans or credit cards or debit cards or sell you insurance every week or month ? These so-called callers mostly have a job where they are paid on the number of people they call in a day and if they don't meet that target, these callers will also be scolded by their managers. Some of them will be scammers as well, some we as people are careful off and sometimes people get scammed. Similarly, You will also see many people in Malls or Electronic shops telling you to share contact numbers with them. Why are they asking this ? Because their managers have told them to take and note done numbers of people they talk to. These managers might also be screaming at them. Reports are made everyday, on field jobs have to send Checklist whether they have succeeded in completing the minimum quota of talking to people. I agree 80% of Managers are great and very helpful but you will also find others like the one in the videos. Even a good manager might scream at a person due to some frustration or other things. It is obviously wrong and mentally hurtful. I am surprised that people are surprised by this Gosh that's bad - i have a feeling that given enough time, we'll end up naming all companies that operate in India, in this thread. Mahindra I was just doing a small stint at Reeliance Insurance. They used to target poor families by hosting a drawing competition in poor schools and letting the parents know that their kid has won an award. So the poor gullible parents used to come to the reliance office and they would be pitched a term Insurance product. The speech would be like if you die today, whoâ€™s gonna support your family etc etc. used to scare these poor families. Felt it was such a scam, taking advantage of poor families. Quit within a month. They pay a lot. So if you switch, other companies are not able to match the salary. Hence retention rate is high. But also ruin your credibility in the market especially mine by sharing terrible feedback making it difficult for me to find a job. No one is surprised. But this is the first time it's out in the open like this. We need to keep up the momentum and share incidents like this regularly. We need to collect evidence and put it in the public sphere. Thats the only way we will ever get any resolution. We cannot depend on our HR. We have to take matters into our own hands for our sake and for the future generations. Otherwise this bullshit will continue. We need a r/bossfreakout Thats really bad man :/ Hope you get into something better. Try and join hotels. You'll be glad you're stuck in corporates. Especially if you're a chef Looks like maharashtra. In north india there is no work culture, there is bauji culture. HR is bauji's lapdog. Bauji doesnt do shit and just keeps tab on who is coming and foing out of the odc. Also, everything else at that company is absolutely shit in north. I had a friend who worked for IHCL for 6 months. That guy stood unmoved like a rock while his mother was undergoing cancer treatment but he couldn't withstand the hotel industry. Yes. And more people need to be aware of the exploitation done in hotels. Working 17-18 hours a day. No breaks. No offs. Cuts, burns and bruises. Pay like peanuts. The positive is that it makes you tough. Battle hardened. Wish the media/industry changes for the good. I worked in Tech Mahindra as a System Admin and I had a boss who was the Project Manager. I had joined the work when the Covid outbreak happened and even during the course of Covid in 2020, I had to go to office as soon as May cause business should not be affected even by 1%. It was a nightmare working for this guy who did not understand there was a covid going on. He was toxic af to even the team managers. Had to endure for a year cause no one else was hiring at that time and I did not want to lose my current job. Thankfully got into a good company now that treats me well. Even during my fuckups(more than once, recent one had cost the company like 2 lakh rupees), we would try to figure out a solution and see what it had happened instead of blaming and screaming at each other. Luckily i have some good paying skills so im doing well for myself. But yes its been terrible. Thanks mate. I agree. My brother left the prestigious Taj Mumbai because of how the supervisors treated him. Heâ€™s doing well now. So you need something terrible to value the good. An organization named Impact Guru. Just head over to their Glassdoor to learn more. I've worked in IT only. I have worked under several managers over the years. Some are very good and helping. Majority of them go neutral. and ofcourse bad apples will be there. Mostly it's the managers who technically suck act as a-holes. Because they cant understand what a developer is saying and they have to show their power somehow. Well in hotels we say Taj is one of the better brands where they atleast treat better. There are brands where the work is brutal. Can't name, unfortunately. Although, I'd reckon hotels do build character. Toughness. And teach you much more than what a book or a fancy school can. Anybody from the hotel industry? Yes khud ka dukh sabko hi bada lagta hai... But hotel industry might look really glamorous from the outside, you get to hang out with the celebrities, if you are on a good position,you get to try all the cuisines at the organization's expense n blah blah. However is is less discussed but hotel industry too is really toxic.. Can someone please can share their first hand experience.. I used to work as a pvt. teacher giving 6 classes daily for peanuts. My boss told me i wasn't good enough for job, fired me after 3 months. I am currently working in govt. Organization on contract. Curious what pressure gets put on a chef? To make dishes faster? That's the least of things that bother us. A friend of mine used to work for ICICI as an RM. He was paid peanuts like 25k pm after doing an MBA from a good institute. Secondly he used to have daily morning calls with the RBH for ULIP commits. They were asked to use any trick in the book to sell ULIPs. They had access to every customers entire history (in fact I even made a post about this years ago) and they were asked to use this info to sell ULIP or prepaid (brokerage) There was an extreme incident where a female RM was asked by the manager to go sleep with the client to get the sale. She recorded it and reported it and the manager was fired. There were multiple incidents where if an RM hadn't met his commit, the manager would call him up at 7pm and ask them to travel to a branch on the other side of the city. Like say if they were in Navi Mumbai, they'd be asked to go to South Bombay and call the manager from there. Once they'd call the manager from there - the manager would ask them to go home. This was a daily tactic apparently. Other than this there were three commit calls that happened every day which were basically abuse. My friend quit within one year and joined a consulting firm where the hours were much longer but no one ever treated him like a slave again. Accenture is as bad as it gets. I was expected to know everything, be on call for almost 10 hrs each day, then do lot of work. Taking a leave was a nightmare. Plus our manager shouted on us on daily basis. Luckily, I was able to switch within a year. Jio is indeed very horrible. I also had a soul crushing experience there. Manager was harassing me and not letting me leave the team either. The whole thing then imploded into an intense shouting contest. I get you mate. My brother worked for Taj. He told us that he was slapped and verbally abused by his supervisor. Though he told this to us much later. Otherwise I myself would have broken his supervisorâ€™s bone. Makes me mad. That is what my Dad refers to as Lalaism or Lala culture. These are establishments with no potential for growth and the owners/ bosses are narrow minded people who just stick to the rules. They are afraid of criticism and cannot expand their horizons. They are afraid of questions and will create issues out of thin air. Reminds me of someone in Delhi! Oh yeah thatâ€™s our PM also! Iâ€™m guessing, for IT itâ€™s quite good as compared to non-IT people. Reading all the comments makes me appreciate my manager and work life balanceðŸ¥² Which group of Accenture and which location? Which group of Accenture and which location? paging /u/icicibank. what is this behaviour?! ^/s Whatâ€™s this Bauji man? Whatâ€™s Bauji man I was in Atci, working as Cloud migration architect at bangalore Strange because everyone talks of how HR is all powerful SBI. I was working in a Branch Office which was difficult in all aspects. Improper internet connectivity, location and size of the branch, even the road to reach the branch. This manager was so asshole that he would give every work to me and not delegate the work to another clerk, which could have reduced the stress overall. I would have to stay late and leave the branch late; driving back to the village where I lived was so tough, I was almost questioning my own existence. The branch also had no 2nd and 4th Sat and Sunday off, which fucked a lot in my life, personally and professionally. I learnt from some other clerk that he was working in another organisation (where my father worked for more than 3 decades before retiring in 2016), and there the job made him have suicidal tendencies. I could feel the behaviour seeping into my work as well. I soon realised that even if I work hard to promotion, nothing would made me get out of here. So I resigned, took a break, prepared for another exam and cleared it. Moving out of Lunchtime is probably the best decision I took in my life till present. SBI.

You posted the comment thrice by mistake I'll try to keep it short...you are paid for 9-12 hours shift but you are working for 16-17 hours on a stretch 'normally' And yes there is nothing called as overtime in hotel industry. I used to stay in Thane, and worked at a 5 star at CSMT. There were days when I worked for so long...hardly 2 hours to my next day shift...so there was no point in going back home. Hotel guys can relate... everyone has an extra pair of undergarments and towel etc in the locker..just in case.. And payment is literally peanuts My opinion there are good managers. There are bad managers in every company to some extent. Build character ? Toughness ? I think we need to get rid of this thought process for a JOB ! A job should be where you work, and get paid your fair share and beyond your work hours your job can fuck right off. We are humans, not bloody coal waiting to be turned into a diamond. I agree. In my past two jobs, I joined under angels. Then something happened and they were allotted new roles. And I was put under literal demons. That has happened to me twice now. I absolutely hate it. Oh man where to begin about hotels in India. I did HM from Agra and worked for 2 years in a business hotel.in Bangalore. The hotel industry in India is Blue Collar AF. The starting pay is 12K and shifts are crazy. A lot of staff is older and who have been working at the same hotel and same position for decades and have a chip on their shoulders. That whole \"Aaj ke launde hame sikhange\". They forcefully take tips away from newbies and interns. Managers fucking eat in the restuarants themselves or would have banquet food but give the lower staff 15 minutes to go and have their meal ( which more often than not is shit). You may think chefs would get to make gourmet meals and shit but that's far from the reality, most of the times you're stuck peeling onion, carrot and doing basic mise en place and constantly face abuses from superiors. I remember this one intern who was in banquet service with me hadn't gotten a leave in 15 days and had gotten blisters on his feet. He just couldn't take it and said to hell with this and went home limping. The worst part is there is no fixed shift timings as well, you will do a morning shift on Monday which is like 7-5 and afternoon shift on Tuesday which is 2-11 and then do night shift on Wednesday. Fucks up your sleeping pattern completely. I could go on and on but the hotel industry in India needs serious reforms. My boss asks for help during his booty call . I wish i can expose it to his wife someday. Coding ninjas employees locked their employees up in the office ðŸ˜­ I really liked how this video got viral. We all have such horrible people in our organisation and the top management ignore their behaviour because they are holding big position / important for the company from the aspects of money/profitability. Like the top boss of our plant is infamous for his verbal violence but at the same time he is able to bring down conversion cost per kg miraculously. Master of getting things done with minimal manpower. So obviously top management ignoring his abusive angry behaviour. This women % thing is happening in my company too. So I can relate. A male coworker had to do so much more, listens to verbal abuse, no words of praise, sacrifice the leaves. I am not against gender equality but management seriously need to look at it once more. I heard that they are doing this because of some benefits government will provide if you have certain amount of female staff. Don't know the reality. It hurts the gender dynamics. In adidas itself. After i was fired. An SLT member visited India and pointed out the lack of a lady cluster manager. The company went nuts and promoted a store manager who hadnâ€™t completed 18 month(company policy was no promotion before 18 months) my male former colleagues and friends were informed of the opening, naturally they applied to receive a mock interview just to show that interviews were done and this woman was selected. Same happened with me they chose someone who didnâ€™t have the experience and was at a lower designation than me. According to many sources I was the best choice internally and many who had applied for the position gave up after hearing that i had applied too. However they went with that lady. Who apparently took 6 months to learn the job. And she was trained by my colleagues and friends. Same to same things are happening in my organisation. We don't have any complaints whatsoever working under /with a competent female candidates but just for the sake of gender diversity these management guys are recruiting incompetent female staff that's something not justified. These Indian companies are run by frauds in Armani Suit. From execs to senior managers all are toxic because they lack creativity and imagination let alone any skills or tact. Anand Mahindra's insurance/loan company employees third party collection agent aka thugs who were recently in news because they ran a tractor on a farmer who couldn't repay his loan and killed him. All this bloody Anand Mahindra did was to on to Twitter and wrote how sorry he feels. And I'm pretty sure he sheepishly felt proud that it was only one such case. The rest are still profitable and in progress. This needs to change. No wonder why some of us run to foreign countries for better opportunities and skill recognition. Somebody tweet this to that Mahindra unkil. maybe he just hated his mother /jk Parasitic lowlives of planet earth Mf looks like a pig and screams like one too. Just think for a minute, my take would be completely different, what's the point of achieving such targets? For me, it is like exploiting the resources for things we have no demands for! These managers will achieve their targets, they will get promotions and incentives. Company's market valuation will go up. After 30-40 years of service, what these slaves will get? Ghanta! Look at their mental and physical health, it's ruining day by day! What is the point of running the economy so fast when you have super smart govts who spends entire budgets on PR or on other things?? This chu manager doesn't know when we might get over due to his anger issue, sale ne pakka term insurance le rakha hoga! In 2014, I had faced this kind of abuse, where I was hired just out of college as a Graduate engineer Trainee in one of India's largest CV manufacturer. Little did I know as I was only 21. But this triggered me on a path to leave India for future career from that day. If you are young, just remember any guy shouting has no rights to treat you as a scumbag and it reflects only the company culture where at a position where he is because of the rotten leadership and toxic culture of bootlicking. Worked at HDFC Life for short time, At start of each month Manager(ACH) used to force us not to self login for attendance until we sold at least one policy every month. This was known to the top brass of the company and was recommended by them using the phrase \"Don't let them rest, make them uncomfortable\". In simple and plain words was a hell hole. There was literally a study posted about European colleges favouring female students more than male students gradings. It has started stunring the male students learning performance and making them drop out or fall behind!!! Shit is insane. Boys are being punished for their gender. Wrong. The point is there are good CEOs and shit CEOs. The shit ones reach targets shittingly. The good ones are taken advantage of and never grow !Remind me 2 days I will be messaging you in 2 days on [**2023-06-08 21:24:24 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2023-06-08%2021:24:24%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/142b7ds/expose_your_terrible_bosses_and_organizations_a/jn68t8x/?context=3) [**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Findia%2Fcomments%2F142b7ds%2Fexpose_your_terrible_bosses_and_organizations_a%2Fjn68t8x%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202023-06-08%2021%3A24%3A24%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam. ^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20142b7ds) ***** |[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)| |-|-|-|-| >They are afraid of criticism and cannot expand their horizons. >They are afraid of questions and will create issues out of thin air. The PM isnt afraid of criticism, he just doesn't like answering questions. And questions to the face aren't criticisms, news articles and OPEds are. PM isn't exactly controlling the press lol. You can either control the press or evade it, not both at same time. Also, issues out of thin air? Somehow this feels like a weird criticism. He does make a mountain of a mole hill, sure. But Thin air? There is no such thing as \"fair share\" for pay. You will be paid your market value for your labour. Universal basic income is also not exactly fair share pay. It's a completely different logic of fair pay for survival in society. Again, no such thing as fair share of pay. >We are humans, Jobs are also careers. Your logic applies only when you will be in same job for your whole life. Nobody wants that without UBI which actually grows according to inflation, which it never does. Since we are in a country which is really really far away from UBI system, you have no choice if you want to build a career out of the job. Blameless culture is so important. It fosters an office culture with much less politics. I'm in Canada and there's a group of us that play cricket. A lot of people who play with me are people who are over 30. And a lot of them made really good money in india(2-3L) per month but the reason they left is because of work culture. Over here unless you work for desis, people don't even call you when you're done with work or during the weekend. My friend worked at Oberoi group as the front desk and eventually guest manager for about 4 years. He's told me horror stories about it. Once he was arrested for asking a noisy, drunk guest who was creating a ruckus after his prostitute left to be quiet. Guy was an MLA and called the cops on him! Morals are for the poor or the powerless. That is cheap way to sell term insurance Because all companies have one or two bad apples. Everyone knows them and remembers being bruised by their behavior. No one will remember the good ones who treated their team with respect and compassion. I remember a while back someone had posted a video of their manager at Byjus insulting them, insulting their family, in ways I wouldnt treat a stranger let alone a colleague. Byju's took the very considerate path of.... DMCA takedown of every place that video was ever posted on the net. I dont think it exists anywhere now despite being all over the net for a week. EDIT: Reddit post which was taken down by DMCA * TBH that's the reason people should buy term insurance. And it's not exactly expensive like regular insurance I'm just joining the corporate world, honestly while watching such videos I always feel ki these guys getting scolded are adults who need to show some self respect and stand up against this toxicity. I'd like some explanation on this. Apart from salary threats, what makes them feel that it's easier to stay quiet and let it affect their mental health day after day? Government IT contract- manager would bark like a dog at new hires. With most jobs like this, daily wage, gig or contract office jobs should not be devalued. Expecting you to be locked into toxic arrangements for years is simply wanting locked up slaves. Societal pressure for big name office jobs, family unreasonably burdening you etc. Insurance companies are big leeches that keep blood even if they become fat. It's addiction for hoarding resources by the 1%. This is horrible and needs a giant strike. Plot of The Apartment Congrats, what do you do now ? Chefs working in toxic environments is a universal thing. Not restricted to India. That said, I can imagine how an Indian work environment would just make things much worse. Chief street mugger You'll be locked in our Chernobyl branch This takes the cake. Every brand I guess. and truck owners and truck drivers are another type toxic jerks. Everyday is stress and struggle. If they complain, they'll be the ones who will be fired. They'll be the ones who won't get experience letters. The manager will sully their names in the market. They will have to explain their sudden departure to the next company. And most people have liabilities - cos of the liabilities they are unable to quit. When Jio launched I was a part of a pan india project with them My colleagues used to travel long distances from suburban towns to the city where coming and going back to home took almost 6 hours daily One day a guy while working fell asleep in his chair There was a guy jitender mahapatra who was big shot in reliance literally went to the guy kicked his chair and started screaming at him as if he had done a big immense crime The guy rose folded his hands and left the office never saw him again Don't know why but felt happiness in my heart for the actions of the day A silent effective slap on the management This is a Xerox copy of multiple experiences in my career. The good ones are always remembered. That is not true. Any time I've joined under a great manager, I've been told that by everyone on the floor. >ACH Were you in the Agency channel? Most comments here range from IBFC to insurances, I've had my luck and life tested working for our in-house twitter giveaway legend who uses his surname on cars, when covid stuck, we were not even given any WFH, from very next day we were asked to report to work or be fired. Ofcourse higher-ups knew this and never set foot in office till late 2022 !. Add to this global semiconductor shortage and excruciating long work hours. I remember having to stay hungry without any food for whole day because all shops were closed and workplace had no arrangement for lunch either. After working for 3.5yrs and getting COVID+ TWICE !, we were simply given PIP because they wanted to reduce workforce. Yearly hikes were an amazing 2-4% because of business slowdown (while execs kept raising stock prices). Neither you could switch because Auto sector is not that well paid. Just writing this makes my blood boil. I hope you know why your \"*surname MUV800\"* cars are cheap, because they were paid by us engineers who worked all though covid and never got paid for our efforts anyway. Glad someone pointed out the shit going on in public sector banks these days... Our previous generation enjoyed this job as job for life but after Modi, government's every xyz scheme is routed through banks which means chaos, redtapism, bootlicking, stress, long hours, zero personal life in the name of sarkari Naukri... People nowadays don't respect bankers and even the hardworking staff bears the brunt of the prejudice. I had a GM literally say that those who do not have babies yet should refrain for next two years(his tenure) on the day he joined and this who have babies should find creche services coz everybody should forget that they have a family for next 2 years... He till date is the most hated boss I've come across, people worked 9-9 every day with no appreciation, would publicly slam people by saying free ki salary lene me sharam nahi aati, once he was at some conference where he would hand over the award for good performance and then say it loud you don't deserve this free ki salary le rahe ho sharam karo... I worked for IT/BPO and was lured into this in the name of sarkari but God knows I feel like resigning every morning, changing job is also not an option coz I don't have the calibre for today's competition for any other govt job Can someone share exp in Biocon? I have family who worked there in 2013-2015 ran away because of abusive bosses. Now in 2023 a guy in my PG is upset about getting berated everyday by his boss there. From what he tells me because it's a big brand people suffer the abuse for sometime so they get the name on their resume. Has nothing changed? Yea lets gooo .. expose all of these mfs This is actually shocking for me as a 22 year old starting his career. A few years ago I was on track to do my engineering and MBA and whatnot but decided against it because I was always passionate about photography and cinematography. I did my degree in it and today I work as a freelancer so my earnings can vary between 25-50k depending on how many projects I can get. Sometimes I see my friends working in Microsoft or Google right out of college or moving to the states to work and I do think if I made the right choice of getting into working in the entertainment industry and honestly, I think I've made the right choice for myself. If y'all have any views, I'll love to get some perspective on this. ESIC Yes in Agency channel. This is the real reason bosses want people to work from office Help needed to share audio clip from HDFC VP who also abused employees.. i don't know how to do it i have the clip and his details Can anyone translate what he was saying in the video? Hoo boy! You trigerred PTSD in me about this topic. Where do I start? Let's go with the bad ones first: Yours truly - IT consultant and general busy body who can talk multiple languages and weasel myself into talking to both low level as well as management folks. Worked on a lot of sarkaari IT projects. NIC/C-DAC and other state owned IT - crap pay for engineers, abusive managers, crap culture, ass kissing, bootlicking, nepotism, corruption, technology stuck 10-20 years behind. You will be surprised at the budgets these companies get and the payscales for management, and it is astounding any big project gets done at all. Hire some talented UI/UX designers you lazy, incompetent fuckers! IOB/SBI/Canara and all the chota PSB banks - the worst of the lot. fail to adapt to modern consumer needs and IT infra running on creaking old HW and software. The only gig where I actually wanted to climb into the old ancient HW and stick my neck into the huge ass fans and kill myself. 16 hour work days, abuse, psychological manipulation, psychopathic managers, overworked staff. Fixed cost projects spell DOOM! One manager actually physically assaulted an employee for typing in a wrong command that fucked up the network config. They keep posting non-native people to branches where most of the staff and customers do not speak the same language. I feel sorry for the Infys, TCS, HCLs and other services companies that have to work on these projects - it has failure written on them even before the project starts. The good ones: You may be surprised, or may be I just got lucky with these - YMMV: BEL Bangalore - chill as fuck 9-5 job, but 6 day work week. culture still stuck in the 1980s, but most of the old unkills have been forced to retire. No pressure to deliver anything, and they work on big complex products and projects. Ass kissing exists, but by and large they leave the employees alone. There are lot of women in leadership positions, maybe that;s why the culture is like this. Hire more women in management! ISRO - No suprise here. Culture used to be even better, but culture trickles down from the top. Mostly solid engineers in the top, and it tells. Surprisingly sophisticated for a sarkari company, but APJ and Seshan left a legacy of excellence and getting the job done. Post it on YouTube and then post the YouTube link here. Few years back, Agency was a dying channel - high costs and low revenue. There were rumors that top management was thinking of shutting down Agency permanently and getting rid of everyone. The Agency leadership was desperate on hold onto their careers and that's when such culture became widespread. Funnily, Agency has recovered recently and is doing well. A big reason for that was the new agency head, who cut down on the sales pressure and focused more on agent recruitment. Getting good quality agents turned out to be the key to becoming profitable. Hey,man. I shot you a DM, could you please check that? I am here to share my recent work experience in an edtech company, which unfortunately turned out to be quite disheartening and challenging. I believe it is important to express my thoughts and feelings in order to process and reflect upon the negative aspects of my time there. One of the primary issues I encountered was the exceptionally long hours I was expected to work. The demands of the job often extended far beyond the typical 9-to-5 schedule, leaving me with little personal time or opportunities for rest and rejuvenation. This imbalance between work and personal life took a toll on my well-being and overall job satisfaction. Moreover, I had the misfortune of working under a manager who fostered a toxic work environment. Their constant shouting and aggressive demeanor created an atmosphere filled with tension and anxiety. The relentless pressure to achieve sales targets, coupled with the manager's unreasonable expectations, made it challenging to thrive in such an environment. It became increasingly difficult to maintain a positive mindset and motivation to excel when faced with such excessive stress. Unfortunately, the negative impact of these circumstances extended beyond my professional life, affecting my overall mental and emotional well-being. The constant barrage of pressure and hostility took a toll on my confidence and self-esteem, leaving me feeling devalued and demotivated. I left for good and thats been the best decision of my life. If any company requires a GPTW certification, it means they weren't able to achieve it naturally. Hence have to prove that they are good. As a Manager my self, i would love to share this thread to my team as sometimes these idiots try to walk all over me and I have to show them their place. I wish I had a manager like myself when I started off.. uff My manager lost a 100 headcount project. In this market, you think he would be fired. But no, he was rewarded with a promotion & 20% increment. Meanwhile, I worked hard in the same project and got funding for 5 more heads. I got a grand total increment of 3% coz that's the \"HR policy\". Only when organising Anktakshri on weekends. HR does not play any significant role as far as I know. I worked only 13 months, so my experience is limited. One of the worst job I ever did. I loose my shit when I had an urgent work and I told my manager in advance that I will log out at 8 pm to visit a doctor. He shouted at me when at 7:55 I reminded him that I will log out. I had already worked 9 hours that day, so it was not like I was logging early. I resigned in same month later. Hyundai dealership same story. During one of my old jobs, my grandpa had died very unexpectedly. I told my boss that I would be gone Friday-Sunday for the funeral, since he lived in a different state. Sunday comes by, and it's clear by all the traffic and such that we wouldn't make it home until 10 AM at the earliest, since we drove. I texted my boss to tell him that I wouldn't make it until 10 AM on Monday instead of 7 AM on Monday. This somehow offended him as he sent a long angry text telling me that I had only requested Friday through Sunday off and how selfish and lazy I was for not telling him before that I would need Monday off. But he also made sure to mention that he wouldn't have given me Monday off anyway because several people had already gotten Monday off and he needed me in. I had to explain that it is physically impossible for me to get there on time. He told me to hurry up and come in anyway. I was very new to the workforce so I did. But because I couldn't sleep on the whole drive home I got very sick and passed out during work. He then fired me for not being \"professional\" enough or whatever. And this is quite strange to me because this was at a Mormon warehouse, the same people who claim to be the friendliest kind of people. \\[I would know, I grew up surrounded by Mormons\\]"
