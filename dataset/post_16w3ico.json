        "Yes.\n\nChild abuse laws were nearly absent till 2003. Later too it didn‚Äôt protect non-female victims. \n\nAnd rape was restricted to vagino-penal intercourse only. Non-vagino-penal, non-consensual intercourse would have been Unnatural Sex + Physical Assault and not Rape. \n\nHopefully the new penal code is properly streamlined, including all new acts that supersede the relevant sections of IPC."
