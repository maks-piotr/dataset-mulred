        "From the article:\n\nX (formerly Twitter), owned by billionaire Elon Musk, has confirmed compliance with executive orders issued by the Indian government demanding the suspension of specific accounts and posts that are allegedly associated with the farmers' Delhi Chalo protest. \n\nThe social media company has expressed its disagreement with the Indian government's directives and emphasized its commitment to freedom of expression. \n\n‚ÄúThe Indian government has issued executive orders requiring X to act on specific accounts and posts, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment,\" the official Global Government Affairs account of X wrote on the microblogging site. \n\n‚ÄúIn compliance with the orders, we will withhold these accounts and posts in India alone; however, we disagree with these actions and maintain that freedom of expression should extend to these posts,\" it said. \n\nThe Global Government Affairs also informed that a writ appeal challenging the Indian government's blocking orders remains pending. ‚ÄúWe have also provided the impacted users with notice of these actions in accordance with our policies.\"\n\nDue to legal restrictions, X said it is unable to publish the executive orders but said that making them public is essential for transparency because the lack of disclosure can lead to a lack of accountability and arbitrary decision-making. \nThis came after the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) finalized its emergency order directing top social media companies like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), and Snap to block 177 accounts and links related to the farmers' protest to maintain 'public order‚Äô.\n\nMeitY issued the emergency orders at the behest of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and these were in addition to the final orders issued on 14 February. The report notes that both the blocking orders issued on 14 and 19 February are conditional and have been issued till the duration of the protest, after which the social media companies can restore these accounts and channels.\n\nThe orders were issued against 35 Facebook links, 35 Facebook accounts, 14 Instagram accounts, 42 X accounts, 49 X links, 1 Snapchat, and 1 Reddit account. Notably, while it is common for the government to take down Facebook and X accounts, this is the first time the Centre has issued a blocking order against Snap.",
        "Where's  the transparency nd freedom  of expression when u r still suspending accounts ,why the pretense ü§î",
        "What do you expect X to do? Break the law? If they break the law, they could get banned in India and the Indian Government will then have greater leverage against the company to censor even more stuff. So they‚Äôre saying they‚Äôll comply with the order because it‚Äôs the law but disagree with the premise that content on the platform gets censored.",
        "Sure , break the law nd they ain't getting banned    at the end of the day Modiji is an influencer nd there ain't a better platform for him to influence than X .We'll find ways to use X  , it's a way bigger loss to the govt.  Whatsapp  nd X are where majority  of their  lies are forwarded  .Govt bent down to promote KOO as an alternative , nd look at where it's  right now .And all this Censoring bit does the Government  more harm  ,all the narratives  will fall flat nd we'll  just end up looking like  üá®üá≥",
        "A multinational corporation like X is not going to break the law. Neither is Meta, Snap or Reddit, all of which received similar orders and complied. You cannot blame the companies for not risking imprisonment of employees and heavy fines. Blame the Government.",
        "Which is what I've  done , but here's  the difference  between  Dorsey nd Musk , Dorsey stood  he was threatened  by the govt that they'll be banned for the same reason (did not happen ) , was threatened  by Ravi Shankar Prasad that they'll  be dragged to the court (did not happen ) nd eventually  their offices in India were raided .. X since acquisition  has shut down Mumbai  / Delhi  office  nd have only 3 people  nd a couple of engineers in Bangalore  ..best of luck raiding them .Elon could've pushed back a lil more. Big difference  between  X nd the other platforms because  of the reach ..",

        "Dorsey had his way of running the business, Musk has his way of running it. Since there‚Äôs been a change in management, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any merit in comparing the two. \n\nBottom line is if X pushes back, and in this case, does not comply with the order, X employees could be imprisoned and the company could be fined. That is the law. Doing otherwise is breaking the law. Why would X do that? Breaking the law is never a good idea, and never a good incentive to make a private company do something. So I think the only blame here lies with the Government, X and other social media platforms are following the law the country‚Äôs laid out. They have no choice.",

You‚Äôll not exactly take a stand against the government and the alcohol ban because frankly you don‚Äôt give a shit. \n\nApply the same logic to beef, cannabis or anything else for that matter.

Break the law? No, but this highlights the owner's hypocrisy. He used to criticise twitter for similar things, but twitter was more selective in their censorship and used to stand up to the governments a lot more than the current management who bends more willingly, [based on ideology](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-matt-taibbi-substack/673698/). > Free Speech Warrior Elon Musk Weaker on Government Censorship Than the Twitter Execs He Fired > The thing is they don't need to support freedom of speech in India They are here to earn money legally and anything against the ruling government is dangerous for them They have high moral ground many companies silently follow what the government says to them but they published this openly take guts which many Indian news channels lack Elon was all talk and no bark on that. He never wanted to actually buy Twitter. He just wanted to talk a big game. It's hilarious that now he had to buy it and now is doing the same thing they were doing. What is the govt so afraid of? Voices?"
