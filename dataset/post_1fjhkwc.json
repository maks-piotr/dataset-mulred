    "selftext": "Summarising the findings, Ms. Aithala said, “We find that the quality of judicial time spent at a court is critical, and simply adding more judges or increasing the number of days that a judge spends in that court are not good indicators to understand court performance. We determine court performance based on a single measure: the time taken for a district court to decide a case. Therefore, our suggestion is that policy efforts should be directed at improving case management practices, effective case categorization, and streamlined administrative processes in district courts.” ",
