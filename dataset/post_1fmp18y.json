    "selftext": "So, I am sure by the title you are aware how this company loves to egregiously breach your privacy at random times of the day, and the funny part is I do not even own a car in the first place to begin with as I can't afford it at the moment. But, be it work meetings or during personal time, this organization loves to breach the boundaries by shamelessly calling me and playing a pre-recorded message. The funny thing is I have enabled FULLY BLOCK DND settings on my number, yet they bypass that filter. I denounced their mischief on LinkedIn/Twitter to no avail and even reporting their numbers to DND of my operator (even though they were warned, did not really help). All they could say is, \"Please share your number, we will add it to our DND list and will not bother you again\". Why should I share my number with an entity that I never was interested in the first place?\n\nIt was time to take a different course.\n\nSo, I logged into my dad's personal email-ID and drafted a strict and confrontational mail to their customer care  pretending that he was intervening in the issue and how he was appalled and disgusted by the way they harass me for no apparent reason, and I threatened them that the next time they call, we will lodge an FIR with the police and will drag their CEO and their company to court and sue them for the same. I refined the mail using ChatGPT. And, voila the calls stopped for good! In the meanwhile I also ported out of Jio to BSNL, and the spam calls also reduced by 90%. So, I have a suspicion that Jio might sell our data to advertisers and spammers. \n\n[The mail I wrote on behalf of my dad to stop harrassing me. Few details are hidden for the sake of privacy. ](https://preview.redd.it/t2xr3vhosbqd1.png?width=3300&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f19b6cb51c00565a721d4214561a09a9fb6a3d)\n\nWhen I did some research on how do these firms like Bajaj Finance and Cars24 get our numbers in the first place? Well, the answer is very simple. A few of us often give our mobile numbers in shopping malls, supermarkets and cinema halls when the cashier says that he/she will enroll us so that we can get discounts/ be a member of their club promising attractive offers. The problem is a few unassuming people give their details and we all know how data privacy laws are non-existent in our country. Before you know it your details are quickly packaged and are sold to data brokers who sort your data based on the city, state, age-group and income who then forward these details to various businesses. \n\nThe solution? \n\nWell, just don't give out your primary number and if possible! You can get a secondary SIM/a virtual number which you really don't care about and you can use it for these purposes.\n\nNow, what to do if your primary number is a victim of spamming? Well, you can only start reporting the numbers to TRAI using your operator's UCC complaint form from their app and the offenders would be warned, then put under restricted usage and eventually debarred from all operators. Since, I use an iPhone and Truecaller does not work well as of now on iOS, I use the voicemail feature to filter out unwanted calls. If someone is trying to reach me, I can redial them back after checking the number's details on Truecaller.\n\n",
