        "Incredibly excited to catch PS2 in the theater tomorrow. Did a bit of homework and rewatched PS1 in preparation, and it continues to stun. What a masterclass in acting, direction, and cinematography, with a fantastic interval block. Chola Supremacy!",
        "1) Re-watched Aankhen after many years. The one with Amitabh, Akshay, Paresh, Arjun & Sushmita Sen. They have chopped off the original ending.\n\nOld ending: Amitabh gets jailed. Akshay & Arjun survive, they find all the jewellery hidden in Paresh's harmonium & Sushmita's brother. They are shown sitting in the train and as the train starts Akshay's 6th sense tingles and we see Amitabh sneakily watching them from the platform. A few years later when YT boomed a deleted scene surfaced where Amitabh makes some deal with the police, gets the bank manager jailed which explains his escape from arrest.\n\nNew ending: Amitabh gets jailed. Akshay & Arjun survive, they find all the jewellery hidden in Paresh's harmonium & Sushmita's brother.\n\nI think they are trying to adjust the new end to accommodate the sequel.\n\nFun fact: The writer of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai & Aankhen is the same person, Aatish Kapadia.\n\n2) Re-watched XMen Apocalypse. I think we treated this movie too harshly for its time. Looking at the sad state in which the MCU is currently, this movie was very nice. It had action scenes at proper intervals. Expositions were actually interesting and well paced. The villain was a pure villain with no sad back story or redeeming factors. Violence was nice, Apocalypse beheads three people in a row with Sand, Magneto kills policemen with the locket, Apocalypse's horseman in the start literally folds a person to kill him, Apocalypse burying people alive in the wall.\n\nThis current MCU barely shows any killings, most villains are just someone wronged, lack of action scenes, expositions serve the purpose of promoting the next release rather than anything interesting, characters and actors are starting to become bland over time.\n\n3) Started watching Parks & Rec, yes it was long due finally started it. I remembered it after TLOU E3 starring Nick Offerman. I knew Parks & Rec because of Nick Offerman's memes and somewhat because of Aubrey Plaza being in it. After watching it what an amazing show. Came for Nick Offerman, started liking Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler, Adam Scott.",
