        "Here‚Äôs what Murthy said.\n\nRegarding infrastructure, he urged the government to expedite projects like the Bengaluru metro and emphasized the need for three-shift work in the sector.\n\n\"People in those infrastructure industries must work three shifts, they should not work just one shift...come at 11 am and then go at 5 pm. At least on the Electronic City road, that is what I see, I may be completely wrong,\" Murthy said.\n\n\"But in other nations that have high aspirations people work two shifts. I would return around midnight (when abroad), and I have seen people working as if they are going to disappear tomorrow morning. I cannot vouch for three shifts, but I can definitely vouch for two shifts,‚Äù he noted.\n\n\"We want to be better than all those countries. Why don't we say our people - work three shifts? Ask them what are their requirements to complete the stretch by their workers in three shifts - provide that. If we do that, I have no doubt that why India cannot grow faster than China,\" Murthy added.\n\nYeh desh ke buddhe sathiya gaye hai, is all I have to say.",

        "Infosys refuses to pay night shift allowances to employees if the number of days worked off hours is less than the number defined by their policy. \n\nBefore giving any dumbass suggestions, he should fix all the crap that is happening in the company that he built from scratch.",
        "I have lived in us for over a decade and also worked at wipro after i graduated(similar toxic culture to infosys)‚Ä¶most people in us don‚Äôt work two FULL time shifts‚Ä¶they are two separate part time jobs amouting to 40 hours per week‚Ä¶companies here also pay overtime‚Ä¶ the mcdonalds workers here receive better benefits than software engineers at infosys..if you want people to work more hours, better learn to pay overtime..slimy old fart.",
        "hahahahahahha",
        "3*6 hours shifts = 18 hours \n\n+6 hours of sleep  \n\n= 24 hours \n\nForget workers being humans with family and kids or time for relaxation. They won‚Äôt even have time to shit peacefully, is life worth it if you can‚Äôt even take a dump peacefully without hurry of work ? \n\nIf NM Is referring to 3 shifts with different workers question is who is willing to pay that much ? Be a role model and hire 3x manpower to the work that‚Äôs being fed to 1 person in Infosys.",

        "Suck mah dick",
        "I read through it and this is what he mean. First paragraph mentions NM wants government to speed up the infra with 3 shifts and next he mentions how he saw people abroad working 2 shifts and Indians should work 3.\n\nIt‚Äôs either 1 person working 3 shifts or multiple individuals working 3 shifts. \n\nBoth doesn‚Äôt make sense with time, labour welfare and cost constraints. \n\nNM is not speaking rocket science and I have no affiliation with Infosys. Im sorry that you are dense.",
        "What's wrong with this chacha",
        "I think he means there should be 3shits running. Not individuals working 3 shifts each. Poor wording from him",
        "He is not saying for each worker to work 3 shifts. Rather that infrastructure work should continue for the whole day with 3 shifts of workers. That makes perfect sense actually and in fact I am surprised that is not the case already.\n\nI know people are pissed off with him about the 70hr comment but at least try to understand what he is saying.",

        "Why is he still talking.",
        "I mean his logic has merit, higher productivity at lower prices is India's only competitive edge.\n\nNo one has to follow his logic but that is another matter. The problem with billionaires is they are always willing to sacrifice others in the crusade of achieving so called 'greatness'. \n\nIn other words, a lot of people will die, but its a sacrifice he is willing to make.",
        "Among all the other nonsense he says (70 hours work week), this actually is not too bad or wrong. He is not saying same worker person to work in three shifts, but different workers. Infra projects need velocity to finish and not them lag forever as those projects create massive traffic jams, dusty disruptions - so sooner they can be finished better, even if it means working in multiple shifts and keep work going 24/7",
        "tbf, i have thought this too. A lot of factories and stuff should have atleast two shifts. There are plenty of people to employ so wages for another shift would be the same price but you could be a lot more productive. \n\nThe thing is these employers don't need three shifts. 3 shifts make sense when you have employees working 8 hour days. But so many people here are working 12 hrs or more",

        "He should donate all the money to the country, considering how much he gives patriotic gyaan.",
        "Well the underlying assumption is that the manpower cannot produce anything valuable. \n\nMost of Indias technology sector does outsourcing work for other countries. The net effect is that we don‚Äôt really build anything of value for ourselves. We don‚Äôt value labor, not spend money skill and quality of service. It‚Äôs always a race to the cheapest bottom that makes most businesses unsustainable or drain the lives out of their employees. \n\nTo be honest, it‚Äôs only when real innovation and advancement comes through that we see pockets of our economy changing. Things that come to mind:\n\n1. E-bikes\n\n2. Fintech stack\n\nBut this shouldn‚Äôt be where it ends, we need to push everything from fundamental sciences to advanced engineering to novel economic models to really do better.
