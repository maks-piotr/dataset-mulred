    "selftext": "During the hearing, while discussing traffic issues near the Mysore Road flyover, Justice Srishananda allegedly remarked, “Go to the Mysore Road flyover, every auto rickshaw has 10 people. It is not applicable because the Mysore flyover head left to the market from Gori Palya is in Pakistan, not in India. This is the reality. No matter how strict a police officer you put there, they will be beaten up there.”\n\nIn another, the judge is seen reprimanding a woman lawyer for responding to a question posed to the opposing counsel. In a light-hearted but inappropriate manner, he remarks that she seems to know so much about the opposite party that she might even reveal the colour of his undergarments.",
