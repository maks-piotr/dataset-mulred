    "selftext": "Recently,Â [u/St\\_Broseph](https://www.reddit.com/user/St_Broseph/), Dushyant had rescued a 23-year-old girl from Tiruvannamalai, a town in Tamil Nadu. He had saved her from a tyrannical family which was trying to control her and get her married off. Before leaving Tamil Nadu, the girl had recorded a video message of her from her own house stating that she is leaving home at her own accord and that she does not intend on coming back to her family. She then shared this video with all her family members, friends and relevant police authorities in Tiruvannamalai. She had also, upon reaching Bangalore, called the police control room and informed them that she is alive and well and had left at her own will. Yesterday, upon receiving information that a missing persons complaint was being lodged for the girl, the girl herself had contacted the Tiruvannamalai police and informed them that she has left out of her own will and even offered to video call them to show them she is okay. Dushyant had called the DSP and other police officers of Tiruvannamalai who didnâ€™t receive his calls. He had then texted him to inform him that no missing personâ€™s complaint should be taken because the girl was alive, well and safe. Broseph had even tweeted out to the Police authorities there telling them that he is not able to reach them. (Link to tweet below)  \n[https://x.com/St\\_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19](https://x.com/St_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19)\n\nAt around 2:30 AM today, 3 Tamil Nadu cops in civilian clothes along with the rescued girlâ€™s parents, in a civilian car showed up at Dushyantâ€™s doorstep. They did not show any identification apart from a picture of one of them in a policeman vardi. They asked him about the whereabouts of the girl and then attempted to drag him outside. He accompanied them to the main road where they proceeded to be abusive and aggressive. Then, still accompanied by these Tamil Nadu cops, he went to the Indiranagar police chowki nearby, where the cops were asleep.\n\nThe cops even after being awakened, were helpless and kept asking Dushyant to comply with the unreasonable Tamil Nadu cops. The Indiranagar cops along with the Tamil Nadu Cops and Dushyant went to the SBA Headquarters and started knocking on the door and ringing the bell. The Tamil Nadu Cops were still being extremely aggressive and by now had begun pushing and manhandling him when the people at HeadquartersÂ  werenâ€™t opening the door because it was 4:30 AM ish in the morning by now. Frustrated by these things, these monsters tried to drag Dushyant towards the main road and put him into their civilian car. They used force and ganged up on him when he resisted this blatant abuse of power. They tried dragging him into a car and god knows what wouldâ€™ve happened if he were to go with them.\n\nBy this time Janhavi, got here and tried to support Dushyant. The HQ people had woken up by now and opened the door because of all the commotion. Seeing the HQ open, the girlâ€™s parents lunged inside. Janhavi ran to stop the girlâ€™s parents from trespassing into the HQ and possibly making things worse. She tried to stop the girlâ€™s father. This animal of a person, enraged by being stopped by Janhavi began to hit and punch her. This whole thing was further horrid because Cops from TWO JURISDICTIONS WERE PRESENT THERE AND DID NOTHING TO STOP JANHAVI FROM THIS ANIMAL EVEN AFTER THEY WERE ASKED TO. HE HURT HER SHOULDER, FACE AND KEPT GOING. Dushyant was near the main road and as soon as Janhavi pushed her head out of the door and screamed for help, he ran to her rescue while cops were still trying to restrain him physically. Dushyant had to physically move the assailant away from Janhavi to stop him from hitting her further. The Sub-Inspector of Indiranagar then got to the scene and asked everyone to head to the police station.\n\nEven after so much had transpired and such blatant disregard for law and order had been displayed, the cops at Indiranagar Police Station still tried to TAKE THE TAMIL NADU COPSâ€™ SIDE instead of treating this case on its facts. They were asking Dushyant to not escalate this legally and to comply with them. This whole incident shows how disgustingly entitled cops can get in Tamil Nadu and the height of incompetence shown by Indiranagar Police.\n\nDushyant has decided to pursue this legally. They have gotten medical attention and have medico legal cases. We will hold these abusive cops accountable for their lack of responsibility and blatant violation of procedure. These cops need to be SUSPENDED and the man who hit a FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER MERCILESSLY NEEDS TO BE PUT BEHIND BARS FOR HIS ACTIONS. We will do whatever it takes to bring these cops down because if cops turn a blind eye to crimes, refuse to follow procedure and act in such a brutal and disrespectful manner, are they even cops? Are these shameless scoundrels charged with our safety and protection? Imagine being in this situation instead of a resourceful person such as Broseph, anyone else would have been further assaulted, beaten and persecuted. We cannot rest until the perpetrators are arrested and the cops responsible for this are suspended and for this, we need your help. Follow and amplify St. Broseph posts on this incident across social media, call your journalist friends and inform them about whatâ€™s happened, AMPLIFY THIS VOICE so that the law and order situation may improve and the next time a cop even considers doing something like this, they are reminded thatÂ **PEOPLE OF BANGALORE WILL NOT STAY SILENT.**\n\ntl;dr\n\nDushyant, a social worker, rescued a girl from a controlling family. Tamil Nadu police and the girl's parents showed up at his doorstep at 2:30 AM to take her back. They assaulted Dushyant and another social worker, Janhavi, when they resisted. Bangalore police did nothing to help. Dushyant is calling for legal action against the police and the girl's father.",

        "Nobody seems to ask why TN people are so control freaks. People here love to whine about UP, Bihar but TN is as regressive as these states, if not more. More people marry outside their caste in Bihar than TN.Â \n\n\nThe state has curfew timings for college girls as early as 4 PM, factories are forced to restrict their female employees from going out because their parents will riot on the streets, Dalits are forced to drink stool contaminated water.Â \n\n\n\nAnd the Bangalodu cops being themselves as usual.

    "light_cleaned_title": "ST. BROSEPH AND FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER WERE ASSAULTED TODAY (22nd June, 2024)",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "Recently, [u/St\\_Broseph](https://www.reddit.com/user/St_Broseph/), Dushyant had rescued a 23-year-old girl from Tiruvannamalai, a town in Tamil Nadu. He had saved her from a tyrannical family which was trying to control her and get her married off. Before leaving Tamil Nadu, the girl had recorded a video message of her from her own house stating that she is leaving home at her own accord and that she does not intend on coming back to her family. She then shared this video with all her family members, friends and relevant police authorities in Tiruvannamalai. She had also, upon reaching Bangalore, called the police control room and informed them that she is alive and well and had left at her own will. Yesterday, upon receiving information that a missing persons complaint was being lodged for the girl, the girl herself had contacted the Tiruvannamalai police and informed them that she has left out of her own will and even offered to video call them to show them she is okay. Dushyant had called the DSP and other police officers of Tiruvannamalai who didnâ€™t receive his calls. He had then texted him to inform him that no missing personâ€™s complaint should be taken because the girl was alive, well and safe. Broseph had even tweeted out to the Police authorities there telling them that he is not able to reach them. (Link to tweet below) [https://x.com/St\\_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19](https://x.com/St_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19) At around 2:30 AM today, 3 Tamil Nadu cops in civilian clothes along with the rescued girlâ€™s parents, in a civilian car showed up at Dushyantâ€™s doorstep. They did not show any identification apart from a picture of one of them in a policeman vardi. They asked him about the whereabouts of the girl and then attempted to drag him outside. He accompanied them to the main road where they proceeded to be abusive and aggressive. Then, still accompanied by these Tamil Nadu cops, he went to the Indiranagar police chowki nearby, where the cops were asleep. The cops even after being awakened, were helpless and kept asking Dushyant to comply with the unreasonable Tamil Nadu cops. The Indiranagar cops along with the Tamil Nadu Cops and Dushyant went to the SBA Headquarters and started knocking on the door and ringing the bell. The Tamil Nadu Cops were still being extremely aggressive and by now had begun pushing and manhandling him when the people at Headquarters werenâ€™t opening the door because it was 4:30 AM ish in the morning by now. Frustrated by these things, these monsters tried to drag Dushyant towards the main road and put him into their civilian car. They used force and ganged up on him when he resisted this blatant abuse of power. They tried dragging him into a car and god knows what wouldâ€™ve happened if he were to go with them. By this time Janhavi, got here and tried to support Dushyant. The HQ people had woken up by now and opened the door because of all the commotion. Seeing the HQ open, the girlâ€™s parents lunged inside. Janhavi ran to stop the girlâ€™s parents from trespassing into the HQ and possibly making things worse. She tried to stop the girlâ€™s father. This animal of a person, enraged by being stopped by Janhavi began to hit and punch her. This whole thing was further horrid because Cops from TWO JURISDICTIONS WERE PRESENT THERE AND DID NOTHING TO STOP JANHAVI FROM THIS ANIMAL EVEN AFTER THEY WERE ASKED TO. HE HURT HER SHOULDER, FACE AND KEPT GOING. Dushyant was near the main road and as soon as Janhavi pushed her head out of the door and screamed for help, he ran to her rescue while cops were still trying to restrain him physically. Dushyant had to physically move the assailant away from Janhavi to stop him from hitting her further. The Sub-Inspector of Indiranagar then got to the scene and asked everyone to head to the police station. Even after so much had transpired and such blatant disregard for law and order had been displayed, the cops at Indiranagar Police Station still tried to TAKE THE TAMIL NADU COPSâ€™ SIDE instead of treating this case on its facts. They were asking Dushyant to not escalate this legally and to comply with them. This whole incident shows how disgustingly entitled cops can get in Tamil Nadu and the height of incompetence shown by Indiranagar Police. Dushyant has decided to pursue this legally. They have gotten medical attention and have medico legal cases. We will hold these abusive cops accountable for their lack of responsibility and blatant violation of procedure. These cops need to be SUSPENDED and the man who hit a FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER MERCILESSLY NEEDS TO BE PUT BEHIND BARS FOR HIS ACTIONS. We will do whatever it takes to bring these cops down because if cops turn a blind eye to crimes, refuse to follow procedure and act in such a brutal and disrespectful manner, are they even cops? Are these shameless scoundrels charged with our safety and protection? Imagine being in this situation instead of a resourceful person such as Broseph, anyone else would have been further assaulted, beaten and persecuted. We cannot rest until the perpetrators are arrested and the cops responsible for this are suspended and for this, we need your help. Follow and amplify St. Broseph posts on this incident across social media, call your journalist friends and inform them about whatâ€™s happened, AMPLIFY THIS VOICE so that the law and order situation may improve and the next time a cop even considers doing something like this, they are reminded that **PEOPLE OF BANGALORE WILL NOT STAY SILENT.** tl;dr Dushyant, a social worker, rescued a girl from a controlling family. Tamil Nadu police and the girl's parents showed up at his doorstep at 2:30 AM to take her back. They assaulted Dushyant and another social worker, Janhavi, when they resisted. Bangalore police did nothing to help. Dushyant is calling for legal action against the police and the girl's father.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Keep fighting the good fight, guys! More power to Broseph and his team. If you could make and link posts from more conventionally relevant social media accounts of u/st_broseph or related accounts, it would also help. As there are a lot of people who do not really use reddit. Reddit or Instagram posts maybe? Is there anything that someone whoâ€™s not living in Bangalore can do to help ? Not OP, nor know Broseph personally. You may share the tagged social media posts for better reach. Spread awareness on other platforms They've done it in Twitter, link added to the post now, ig Shameful, Can't believe this doesn't have more traction already. I don't post much, but I have heard of STBrosephs always helping out people when and where they need it, and to have something like this happen to them is just sad. Hoping something gets done and those fuckers get what they deserve. have posted on twitter/ X The fate of being a woman in India. Can't trust a single male - not the father that is supposed to protect you or the cops who are supposed to help you when you're assaulted. Not allowed to take a single decision for themselves without elders with fragile egos losing their shit to control your life. Pathetic. How are they? I hope they are ok. A few good people fighting this horrid system.... We must support them as much as possible. Commenting for Visibility. I am sorry to say this but nothing will happen to the cops no matter how much you try. Yup cops should start being punished for abusing their power. Stories like this makes me feel like we are still in the colonial era. Hope you all go forward with this and file the case. I have read a lot about Broseph and how selfless he is. Hope this incident doesnt make him stop in his endeavours which have helpes so many people How can I help??? If you get justice, and by justice I mean court Justice. THEN I WILL TOuCH yOUR FEET. This is India, *lawlessness* prevails here. Pune Porsche wala is almost free, Judges told to consider boy's TrAuMa. W Judges. ðŸ™ƒ And people say UP cops are trash Law is fucked in this country Be it any state And those cops should be suspended immediately with a Investigation on thier behavior Sleeping in thana? What the fuck? St broseph and that social worker should get justice! He helps people in the time of need when authorities and govt just discards them after taxes. Please everyone share this!! By resharing their twitter post. I guess higher the traction more the visibility and more the impact They say this as UP is always under scrutiny. But from what I've read about TN police they are law onto themselves Is there a place to contribute financially? Question is how can cops who have no jurisdiction in our state come and assault an individual? This is a matter that has to be taken to court. Raise your voice, social media has power Man what the fuck how did TN cops in civillian uniform were able to do such a commotion and the BLR cops just standing and watching?!! All the cops involved should be suspended no questions asked Fuck those people. This jungle raaj is unacceptable. More power to people like broseph who are fighting it. Tag CM Stalin on twitter. It usually works. Most people from that side of the districts are a bit casteist and the police could have been from the same caste as the girl's family. This happens a lot over there and nearby districts. If there's any foto or video evidence upload that too. Fuck those worthless abusive parents. Also those plain clothes people might not be cops, could be some political guys or goondas. Gunda police works for them. Don't expect anything from DMK Nah situations like these they do work on it. Even a week ago something like this happened in the southernmost district. So it's better to put it on twitter tagging CM Stalin. The incompetence of the police is the result of incompetence filtration of the candidates for the posts that they are more suitable. Let's try it then. I hope it works. Except Kerala and some specific NE areas, police forces are shit in all parts of the country. And hell, even in such \"good\" areas you'll find state government bootlickers amongst the police. Police reforms are the need of the hour, since the hour India got independence. Nobody seems to ask why TN people are so control freaks. People here love to whine about UP, Bihar but TN is as regressive as these states, if not more. More people marry outside their caste in Bihar than TN. The state has curfew timings for college girls as early as 4 PM, factories are forced to restrict their female employees from going out because their parents will riot on the streets, Dalits are forced to drink stool contaminated water. And the Bangalodu cops being themselves as usual. Fuckers were sleeping in the police station. I hope heâ€™s safe dushya@okhdfcbank is his upi id. Iâ€™ve been contributing on this. I believe providing monitoring support is a huge factor too if it helps run the broseph headquarters better and help in providing better resources. Can you post a link of the tweet that should be reshared? Iâ€™m new to it and ainâ€™t able to navigate. Thanks Mumbai police is quite friendly and helpful, but like all places they're corrupt and will put on a mujra if you throw enough money. every cop technically has jurisdiction in the entire country, it's the karnataka cops who failed to enforce L&O in their state. But tbh a cop is never gonna arrest or restrain another cop I have read that Mumbai police improved after their operations against the Bombay Underworld, as well as post-26/11 revamps. But still, the corruption and bowing down to politicians remains the same. yes, but as long as you know Hindi or Marathi they tend to be pretty helpful in most cases, it's one of the reasons why Mumbai is safe while being very liberal, no goon in Mumbai can harrass people then cry \" Saar I'm a local speak Marathi saar\", the cops while whack him while abusing him in Marathi He's not free. They are fighting against the bail modification and the police had followed the wrong procedure that's why they are being grilled by the court now. The court just wants to move him away from confinement to his relatives home as he's still a minor. And from relatives home, he will become gayab, brother......when the judges say to consider the trauma of a murderer, you know they are sold people. It wrenchea my heart to say this but the Indian judiciary is corrupt and available to the highest bidder..... If the Porsche fellow gets justice and by justice I mean life imprisonment.... Then I will touch your feet too. It was an accident. He did not pre-plan this to kill those two people. You make him sound like a psychopath. He's still 17, why can't he be traumatized for it? Be rational, don't be emotional. He will get the punishment he deserves even if it gets delayed. If the police wants him remanded, then let them file a plea for cancellation of bail. Imagine the horrors he can inflict behind closed doors. Kudos to team broseph and please get justice for your team mate. This monster needs to be behind bars & get some good old jail treatment. Why did those two people die? What was their fault? A guy is drunk, driving the car before even the name plate is printed and also under the age of 17. >> He's still 17, why can't he be traumatized for it? Such people have a history of bullying people and throwing their weight around. Fr the guy's grandfather is underworld. Whole family ia gunda. What about the families? What about the driver who was kidnapped and ordered to take blame for the child? >> Be rational, don't be emotional. This is the Indian justice system, if people had been rational here and left everything to the \"capable hands of the LaW\" ,the guy would be out and on his way for round 2. And trust me, he will be out for round 2, but this time I hope he offs some very high profile people. The only reason the police discovered the compromised doctor, blood samples changed from son to mother is because of...... Ding ding..... EmOtiOn of the public. You fr sound like a paid fellow speaking on the behalf of such people. >> He will get the punishment he deserves even if it gets delayed. Doubt it, Bastion rape, the guy got scott free Salman khan is free despite killing peoplle on footpath Goa Benastrim killer lady is free dealite causing multiple lives to end cM biren singh son killed someone is road rage, he is scott free. Law is only for muddle class my friend. Hope they won't make you their target next. Biggest achievement of TN police was shoving sticks up the ass of a father son shopkeeper duo, ultimately killing them during COVID. Full support in whatever manner possible. Police in this country needs to be taught a lesson by civic personal and bodies. They consider themselves above the law. Yeah they got medical treatment and also got a medicine legal report do eon all the harrasment marks and scars. This is one reason, I do not engage in any local activities in Bangalore, even if someone scratches or bumps my car, I just mind my own business. No point doing anything, they will go to police station and say speak \"Kannada\" or you are guilty. What the fuck..I hope they get justice against the goons The only way is learning to defend yourself and fighting back. Can't let these uneducated goons push us around anymore. >Follow and amplify St. Broseph posts on this incident across social media, call your journalist friends and inform them about whatâ€™s happened, AMPLIFY THIS VOICE Please post the relevant links, I could not find anything on twitter I mean yeah not surprised the cops were useless. They're not here to protect you, they're here to protect the state. Cops are trash everywhere. I can't say the extent of violence the general public should subject every single cop to without getting banned or ruining pork products for readers. I don't live in Bangalore. But for all of us who are like me, tell us what to do and we will do it. Enough is enough for these entitled people. Wow, such audacity A C A B Cops abusing their power is nothing new in India. They still function on rules and laws established during colonial era. Police might just be reduced to a tool of oppression if no reforms are introduced."
