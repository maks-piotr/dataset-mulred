        "Not surprised at all.",
        "Fuck Instagram I can't even see the comments without creating an account.",
        "what is your point here? the bail amount is too low or you think there shouldnt be a bail at all?",
        "This mf deserves to be kicked on his b*lls. ",
        "Just putting out the information for people🙏🏼",
        "Can we kill them on road?",
        "Well of course. That was expected.",
        "Can someone explain the advantages anticipatory bail? Do police keep an eye on the accused, if not, then wouldn’t any powerful person can just get rid of proofs or even the victim?",
        "That's why I am proud of myself for being indian that's the new normal ab ye us ladki ko threatened krege and case gone zooooooo",
        "You should be lucky, Instagram comments are worst senseless things.",
        "Why are people surprised here for him getting anticipatory bail? Isnt that by the rules? Legal experts, kindly help .",
        "You will not be arrested or jailed untill the court gives order in return you will not leave the country I think",
        "Are you 100% sure he did it?",
        "Before courts, bail is the norm and jail is the exception. Unless there is a threat of the accused running away, courts will generally grant bail.",
        "losers in onex would still be crying how we have gynocentric laws and would be supporting this ra\\*ist",
        "Didn’t know you were a judge",
        "Has that sub turned into an incel/manosphere sub?",
        "Stfu you single brain called fucks, these are all due processes of the law. And all you are believing is her word, maybe she just wants a fat paycheck from a rich family. She decided to get spoilt by rich men going out late at night. His name is out, hers isn’t. If he is actually not guilty, she has committed a crime. Defamation, are you all stupid? What proof do you have? Her word? \n\nI hope if not guilty, she gets counter sued into hell for all this defamation and her name should also be out, only fair.",
        "So from what I hear, this girl wanted to be shown a good time and wanted to be spoilt. She took a decision to go out with random men to get spoilt and after a few days has come out with this. She hasn't released her own name but very well destroyed the other guy's name without any proof which by the way is an offence (defamation) if he is proven not guilty.\nAll you fools supporting her without any due process should know anything she is doing rn amounts to defamation if he is proven not guilty.\nShe is just a girl who likes being spoilt and wants a fat paycheck to keep shit because for Richie's like him that's the easier option.\nRespect the law, we have had enough cases for false accusations when will we learn. Girl should also share her name if guys name is out for no reason.\nAlso next time you meet a random man off bumble try not to get drunk with him at 3-4am at nigh, as a rule of thumb. You can't be dumb enough to put yourself in that position.",
        "Let's say, listen to the both sides first. In law, there's most common term \"Innocent until proven guilty.\" The case is going to be in court for long time and I'm pretty sure these rich men/ celebrities have some top notch advocates to defend them and there are high chances that this matter will get settled outside the Court. Whether the girl needs justice or money, it would be her/ family's decision. \n\nYup, there's pressure from all sides. We're getting divided on the opinion bases but trust me the court will undergo through the evidences which will get presented in the court (it can go on girl's side or the boy's side) \n\nWas just reading a book named \"Defense against fake rape cases by Sumit Kumar Kejriwal\" and it was getting worst.",

        "I don’t know what you mean. But as someone closely related to a guy who was falsely accused, and having seen the state of his life now, I’m not gonna trust anyone based on some random Instagram post with no proof, let alone mob lynching him. \n\nIf that won’t work for you, imagine your brother in his situation and him being beaten to death because a girl said so. So let’s wait for the police to investigate. If there’s proof, he’ll definitely get what he deserves",
        "Inclined to believe the girl more than him coz this apparently ain’t his first rodeo doing scummy shit . Leopards don’t change their spots . Stop victim blaming",
        "Shame...",
        "I gave opinion on rapist what should be done to him if found guilty . My friend faced a fake rape case bro was in 12th when we found rape case was fake we destroyed girl's life completely + her parents dropped her studies and let sit alone home packed . I'm also giving opinion if found guilty there are bad girls too the first thing you share with media get's person mind thinking on that news.\n\nif there's everything false you should also post in favour of guy how another person is supposed to trust . If boy is guilty don't  show mercy to boy same applies to girl whatever happened they only know . Girls are not that bold to make such statement if that's false anyways.\n\nif he'snot guilty obv what we're commenting against him we'll do against her too when she found guilty I'm not feminist or Sigma I judge equally\n\nJustice shall be done that's what all I can say.\n\n**PARENTS SHOULD TEACH THEIR 18-24 GUYS AND GIRLS THAT DATING ON SHITTY APPS LIKE INSTA,TINDER,BUMBLE etc. FOR SAKE OF SEX IS NOT GOOD AT ALL . BRUH I'M 17 I KNOW PRECAUTIONS MORE THAN A 24 YEAR GROWN UP** \n\nMARK MY WORDS IF YOU TRY TO DATE FROM INSTA SOMETIMES IT MIGHT WORK MAYBE YOU FIND SOMEONE WHO DESERVES YOU BUT 99% OF CASES HAPPEN THROUGH SUCH PLATFORMS ONLY \n\n**THE COUNTRY IS ROTTING SO DO PEOPLE MINDSET NO ONE CAN BE TRUSTED IN THESE THINGS DON'T TRUST NO ONE**\n\n**FOR PLEASURE OF HOURS DON'T PUT YOUR WHOLE LIFE ON STAKE**",

        "Yea of course it's favoured.  Status and money he bola mai. That it takes very less for low profile cases like these to get settled in court cases. This case is low profile because it is not covered as much in the media. Anticipatory bail has a price. You get your own lawyer, that lawyer gets a friend judge appointed will get the bail done. It's a mockery of justice. I have had a personal experience so I am fully aware that how easy it is to get anticipatory bail from high court. If the session court does it then questions are raised to the judge. In high court no one gives a crap.",
        "Well atleast in my short span as an advocate, I find it extremely difficult, even SLP’s in SC for anticipatory bails are rejected , even with solid evidences. They usually ask to file bail after arrest.",

        "why will she show proof to social media she has filed a case and she will show the chats to the court .Accuser is the victim until proven false",
        "Accuser is the victim until proven false? Lol. What is this new law that you’re establishing. \n\nThe presumption of innocence states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. Stop already painting him guilty especially when the girl has given zero proofs till now. Stop making new laws to suit your narrative. Also, the anticipatory bail is justified. The rule again says that jail is an exception, not the norm for under trail cases. \n\nIf she doesn’t want to show the proofs to social media then why post at all on the social media. Just file it with the police. Maybe the police is hesitant in filing her case because it has no substance in it.",
        "Accused.",
        "Why do you think judges are referred to as \"my lord\"? It was not just an honorific for the seat of the judge. It's because from its roots, the nobility classes presided over the courts and they were lords because of their status.\n\nWithout a justice system, common people would take matters into their own hands and seek their own justice. By having a justice system in place and pretending that it's fair, the nobility could control the outcome.\n\nFor instance, what would have happened if a girl of working class were to be raped by the son of a noble? Without the justice system, they would have to seek their own justice. This could include lynching the culprit. Alternatively, the noble would use violence to suppress them which would still be bad optics. \n\nBy having a justice system and a court presided by their own fellow class, they could just acquit the rapist citing a technicality. If the victims try to seek their own justice, they could be suppressed or put down in the name of law enforcement and the optics of it would look much better than just direct violence. It's a good way to keep the common folk under check while also protecting the elite.\n\nCenturies have gone by and nothing much changed. A billionaire still gets a slap on the wrist (if at all) for stealing millions and some poor bloke stays in jail for years without bail or trial over suspicion of stealing hundred bucks.",
        "I never said that it is a law it is just my perspective and this perspective of mine is gender neutral . Grandson of a billionare and man with influential background will never be punished until the matter becomes a big news for the nation ,this is the reason for posting on social media and this method has worked last year when son of a minister raped his employee. Police will never take action against powerful people",
        "I am not advocating judges and rich people. I am supporting Law and order. And I also despise people who manipulate law and order.",
        "just asking.......what do you think about that bollywood actresses form of support on that post? dont you think it gives the case at least some seriousness.....?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalthough I still believe it should be not guilty until guilty as a false accusation can ruin his life...if false",
        "Guys, we all know, it's normal for power people to do it.\nSuggest, some suggestions.\nWhat can we in these situations?\nThat thing matters.",
        "Well she'd mentioned that her drink was probably roofied when she went clubbing w them. So firstly, like people say, never take drinks from anyone. \n\nSecondly, the clock starts ticking once the offence is said to have been committed, so you need to be quick. Delaying for days, will only breed assumptions of falsity by authorities.\n\nThird, if something like this happens, instead of confronting the accused, just go ahead with filing an FIR so as to not grant time to the accused in order to prepare for anticipatory bail. \n\nLastly, I think the law is well equipped to punish the wrong. Just believe the process. All these big defense lawyers and law firms can only buy time for their client. Eventually, the judges are humans who see the reality like us. All the stuff we see in the movies, that rich people pay off authorities is a myth and even so, times have changed. Let the law take its course, if you're genuinely a victim you will get justice.\n\n*All this is what I believe and I'm not looking to argue with anyone over anything*",

    "light_cleaned_selftext": "So recently a Mumbai girl posted on her Instagram about an incident where she was allegedly raped by a guy in Worli. It's heard that the guy who did it and his friends are influencial people from the Diamond Industry have links to Bollywood. Here's the anticipatory bail order for your reference. *Counsel that appeared for the accused #Heetik Shah is Sr. Adv. Aabad Ponda briefed by Parinam Law, Mumbai.*",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "Not surprised at all. Fuck Instagram I can't even see the comments without creating an account. what is your point here? the bail amount is too low or you think there shouldnt be a bail at all? This mf deserves to be kicked on his b*lls. Just putting out the information for people🙏🏼 Can we kill them on road? Well of course. That was expected. Can someone explain the advantages anticipatory bail? Do police keep an eye on the accused, if not, then wouldn’t any powerful person can just get rid of proofs or even the victim? That's why I am proud of myself for being indian that's the new normal ab ye us ladki ko threatened krege and case gone zooooooo You should be lucky, Instagram comments are worst senseless things. Why are people surprised here for him getting anticipatory bail? Isnt that by the rules? Legal experts, kindly help . You will not be arrested or jailed untill the court gives order in return you will not leave the country I think Are you 100% sure he did it? Before courts, bail is the norm and jail is the exception. Unless there is a threat of the accused running away, courts will generally grant bail. losers in onex would still be crying how we have gynocentric laws and would be supporting this ra\\*ist Didn’t know you were a judge Has that sub turned into an incel/manosphere sub? Stfu you single brain called fucks, these are all due processes of the law. And all you are believing is her word, maybe she just wants a fat paycheck from a rich family. She decided to get spoilt by rich men going out late at night. His name is out, hers isn’t. If he is actually not guilty, she has committed a crime. Defamation, are you all stupid? What proof do you have? Her word? I hope if not guilty, she gets counter sued into hell for all this defamation and her name should also be out, only fair. So from what I hear, this girl wanted to be shown a good time and wanted to be spoilt. She took a decision to go out with random men to get spoilt and after a few days has come out with this. She hasn't released her own name but very well destroyed the other guy's name without any proof which by the way is an offence (defamation) if he is proven not guilty. All you fools supporting her without any due process should know anything she is doing rn amounts to defamation if he is proven not guilty. She is just a girl who likes being spoilt and wants a fat paycheck to keep shit because for Richie's like him that's the easier option. Respect the law, we have had enough cases for false accusations when will we learn. Girl should also share her name if guys name is out for no reason. Also next time you meet a random man off bumble try not to get drunk with him at 3-4am at nigh, as a rule of thumb. You can't be dumb enough to put yourself in that position. Let's say, listen to the both sides first. In law, there's most common term \"Innocent until proven guilty.\" The case is going to be in court for long time and I'm pretty sure these rich men/ celebrities have some top notch advocates to defend them and there are high chances that this matter will get settled outside the Court. Whether the girl needs justice or money, it would be her/ family's decision. Yup, there's pressure from all sides. We're getting divided on the opinion bases but trust me the court will undergo through the evidences which will get presented in the court (it can go on girl's side or the boy's side) Was just reading a book named \"Defense against fake rape cases by Sumit Kumar Kejriwal\" and it was getting worst. Shocker! >Counsel that appeared for the accused #Heetik Shah is Sr. Adv. Aabad Ponda briefed by Parinam Law, Mumbai. Got a bail so easy what to expect I don’t know what you mean. But as someone closely related to a guy who was falsely accused, and having seen the state of his life now, I’m not gonna trust anyone based on some random Instagram post with no proof, let alone mob lynching him. If that won’t work for you, imagine your brother in his situation and him being beaten to death because a girl said so. So let’s wait for the police to investigate. If there’s proof, he’ll definitely get what he deserves Inclined to believe the girl more than him coz this apparently ain’t his first rodeo doing scummy shit . Leopards don’t change their spots . Stop victim blaming Shame... I gave opinion on rapist what should be done to him if found guilty . My friend faced a fake rape case bro was in 12th when we found rape case was fake we destroyed girl's life completely + her parents dropped her studies and let sit alone home packed . I'm also giving opinion if found guilty there are bad girls too the first thing you share with media get's person mind thinking on that news. if there's everything false you should also post in favour of guy how another person is supposed to trust . If boy is guilty don't show mercy to boy same applies to girl whatever happened they only know . Girls are not that bold to make such statement if that's false anyways. if he'snot guilty obv what we're commenting against him we'll do against her too when she found guilty I'm not feminist or Sigma I judge equally Justice shall be done that's what all I can say. **PARENTS SHOULD TEACH THEIR 18-24 GUYS AND GIRLS THAT DATING ON SHITTY APPS LIKE INSTA,TINDER,BUMBLE etc. FOR SAKE OF SEX IS NOT GOOD AT ALL . BRUH I'M 17 I KNOW PRECAUTIONS MORE THAN A 24 YEAR GROWN UP** MARK MY WORDS IF YOU TRY TO DATE FROM INSTA SOMETIMES IT MIGHT WORK MAYBE YOU FIND SOMEONE WHO DESERVES YOU BUT 99% OF CASES HAPPEN THROUGH SUCH PLATFORMS ONLY **THE COUNTRY IS ROTTING SO DO PEOPLE MINDSET NO ONE CAN BE TRUSTED IN THESE THINGS DON'T TRUST NO ONE** **FOR PLEASURE OF HOURS DON'T PUT YOUR WHOLE LIFE ON STAKE** It clearly says \"accused\" I think you might need some sense This is not the first case. I too have another point of view The dude was absolutely wrong but what did she expect huh? That too going in a club with alcohol and shit when she's just 21. You went into the tigers cage knowing damn well of repercussions. Better to have the full story from both sides. If she's weren't roofied and we're just intoxicated. From what I hear, you are a danger to society and deserve to be jailed. This is probably a bot or a mentally unstable person. I have seen this same comment in three different posts regarding this matter. Source? Haan bhai shi hai tuh unki side lega toh tereko bhi shayad apne ghar ka kutta banale woh log Haan bhai shi hai tuh unki side lega toh shayad tereko bhi ghar ka kutta banale woh log What happened to beti bachao HEETIK! Not the place man. Stay away from social media for a while. There are several more women in the comments of the instagram account saying that were raped by him, there's even an actress who said she ran into the guy but avoided him. There's a history of him being kicked out of schools going back to 8th grade for the exact same reason. Rape rashtra That's power of money. Everybody rides on your dick. Fuck you. Fuck you. I hope no one in your family gets raped. Cause then you’ll say this same shit. Would you say the same shit If your mom was raped? Would you still blame your sister if she was raped? What about your wife? What if your daughter gets raped? Would you still tell your daughter that it was her fault. Fuck you. Fuck you Read about a guy who was in jail for 7 years just for stealing some bread from a truck, sentencing was not 7 years, but he was in jail till he got his sentence, my man was a Dalit. And then here rich people get bail in rape cases. Judiciary A++ Bulldozer kaha hai? If I comment what I actually want to say, my reddit account will get suspended. But the gist of it is that you’re a horrible person, hope the worst happens to you *Parinam Law* is the fucking best in the country! I feel so bad for the girl :( silly human those are for poor people (Gonna be the devil's advocate) was he ACQUITTED before or they were ACCUSATIONS as well? \"Li'l n****... Unfunny thing \" type of unhinged stuff Not a big deal, it is very easy to get anticipatory bail. This is seriously fucked up!, as a lawyer myself moving AB's frequently before the District Court the minimum condition set for the accused is to appear before the resp police daily thrice, the way the accused is to appear only on thursday's is way too much lenience showed to him! HAIN? Ye kabse? Not really surprised.Rules are applicable to poor and powerless people and it has become so normal that cases like these don't even phase me. MSG se link hai kya Personal experience xD. Anticipatory is really difficult to get, the accused has hired the best in the business. And clearly he has been favoured, I am assuming cause of his status. The decision is very lenient [Umar Khalid’s bail plea adjourned by Supreme Court for sixth time](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/16gpchc/umar_khalids_bail_plea_adjourned_by_supreme_court/) Law is used to control, harass, rob,... the poor and dissident citizens. Yea of course it's favoured. Status and money he bola mai. That it takes very less for low profile cases like these to get settled in court cases. This case is low profile because it is not covered as much in the media. Anticipatory bail has a price. You get your own lawyer, that lawyer gets a friend judge appointed will get the bail done. It's a mockery of justice. I have had a personal experience so I am fully aware that how easy it is to get anticipatory bail from high court. If the session court does it then questions are raised to the judge. In high court no one gives a crap. Well atleast in my short span as an advocate, I find it extremely difficult, even SLP’s in SC for anticipatory bails are rejected , even with solid evidences. They usually ask to file bail after arrest. Bhai are you also facing similar situation and are out on anticipatory bill? Thoda personal lag raha hai aapka You of course need great lawyers in sensitive cases like rape and I am not a lawyer but it's just the personal experience that we as a family went through for a fake rape case. What India desperately needs is a solid Witness Protection program. Who’s surprised here?? Only the men, looks like the bastard still rapes the women Power of money, the guy is the son of a retired actress. The mother doesn't give two hoots about who her son rapes. And that is exactly what the justice system was designed for from the start. Which is to protect the interests of the ruling class and the other \"elites\" of the society from the common folk taking matters into their hands. That trend is dying and i see a lot less if these He must have not had a lawyer, which he should have been provided for under NALSA ‘s free legal aid. I didn't anticipate this. It is not designed that way, people are bending justice system and making sure they don't bend enough to broke it. Victim blaming Can someone tell names of ppl involved? That’s the rule. A jail term while case is under trail is an exception, not the norm. What if the guy is the victim and we’re all blaming him? The girl has literally posted no proofs. Just open a new Instagram account, make a post against someone influential and then let the jokers on social media do your job. why will she show proof to social media she has filed a case and she will show the chats to the court .Accuser is the victim until proven false Accuser is the victim until proven false? Lol. What is this new law that you’re establishing. The presumption of innocence states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. Stop already painting him guilty especially when the girl has given zero proofs till now. Stop making new laws to suit your narrative. Also, the anticipatory bail is justified. The rule again says that jail is an exception, not the norm for under trail cases. If she doesn’t want to show the proofs to social media then why post at all on the social media. Just file it with the police. Maybe the police is hesitant in filing her case because it has no substance in it. Accused. Why do you think judges are referred to as \"my lord\"? It was not just an honorific for the seat of the judge. It's because from its roots, the nobility classes presided over the courts and they were lords because of their status. Without a justice system, common people would take matters into their own hands and seek their own justice. By having a justice system in place and pretending that it's fair, the nobility could control the outcome. For instance, what would have happened if a girl of working class were to be raped by the son of a noble? Without the justice system, they would have to seek their own justice. This could include lynching the culprit. Alternatively, the noble would use violence to suppress them which would still be bad optics. By having a justice system and a court presided by their own fellow class, they could just acquit the rapist citing a technicality. If the victims try to seek their own justice, they could be suppressed or put down in the name of law enforcement and the optics of it would look much better than just direct violence. It's a good way to keep the common folk under check while also protecting the elite. Centuries have gone by and nothing much changed. A billionaire still gets a slap on the wrist (if at all) for stealing millions and some poor bloke stays in jail for years without bail or trial over suspicion of stealing hundred bucks. I never said that it is a law it is just my perspective and this perspective of mine is gender neutral . Grandson of a billionare and man with influential background will never be punished until the matter becomes a big news for the nation ,this is the reason for posting on social media and this method has worked last year when son of a minister raped his employee. Police will never take action against powerful people I am not advocating judges and rich people. I am supporting Law and order. And I also despise people who manipulate law and order. just asking.......what do you think about that bollywood actresses form of support on that post? dont you think it gives the case at least some seriousness.....? &#x200B; although I still believe it should be not guilty until guilty as a false accusation can ruin his life...if false Guys, we all know, it's normal for power people to do it. Suggest, some suggestions. What can we in these situations? That thing matters. Well she'd mentioned that her drink was probably roofied when she went clubbing w them. So firstly, like people say, never take drinks from anyone. Secondly, the clock starts ticking once the offence is said to have been committed, so you need to be quick. Delaying for days, will only breed assumptions of falsity by authorities. Third, if something like this happens, instead of confronting the accused, just go ahead with filing an FIR so as to not grant time to the accused in order to prepare for anticipatory bail. Lastly, I think the law is well equipped to punish the wrong. Just believe the process. All these big defense lawyers and law firms can only buy time for their client. Eventually, the judges are humans who see the reality like us. All the stuff we see in the movies, that rich people pay off authorities is a myth and even so, times have changed. Let the law take its course, if you're genuinely a victim you will get justice. *All this is what I believe and I'm not looking to argue with anyone over anything* Not for these charges. Beti Bachao beti padahao. Nicely said. Poor Muslim* people Isko brutally maarna chahiye, chainsaw ke sath. You're a single brained mf, there's literally evidence and he S.A a 6th grade girl too No, we have proof from various other victims of him and various schools from which he was kicked out, starting from 8th grade. feeling extremely disgusted by these rich blokes. But, would it be mean or wrong on my part if here I ask the name of the girl ? What if the poster is related to the accused? They are defending vehemently, something is off >jail is the exception its all depends how strong your case is, and how much money you have. unfortunately. Damn!! That's sad. I had joined the sub when it was established last year and things were good at first, later it was all about bashing posts of women made in TwoX and I left it. Didn't realise that things have spiralled downwards after that! have a look there lol. men were literally defending this heetik rap\\*st and were shaming the victim Gosh, that's sad. Do you have the link to the post there? The fact that you’re able to show more empathy for a potential rapist than a potential victim is concerning. Get help. Does anyone have any updates on this case? I cannot find any news anywhere on the internet"
