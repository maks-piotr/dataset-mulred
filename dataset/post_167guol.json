        "What a nothing burger, the reason there are so few SC/ST candidates getting into competitive phd programmes is because IIT/IIMs etc because no reservation programme exists at that level.\n\n[https://www.telegraphindia.com/edugraph/indian-institutes-of-managements-yet-to-implement-reservation-provisions-for-admission-in-research-courses-and-faculty-recruitment-rti/cid/1957484#:\\~:text=Under%20the%20Central%20Educational%20Institutions,Backward%20Classes%20(OBCs)%20respectively](https://www.telegraphindia.com/edugraph/indian-institutes-of-managements-yet-to-implement-reservation-provisions-for-admission-in-research-courses-and-faculty-recruitment-rti/cid/1957484#:~:text=Under%20the%20Central%20Educational%20Institutions,Backward%20Classes%20(OBCs)%20respectively).\n\nGetting into these programmes is hyper competitive, I know someone who has gone through the process. It's not uncommon to find a MIT grad interviewing for the same job as a central university grad.",
        "How about having a discussion about what constitutes merit? It can very well be argued that clearing JEE (and other competitive exams) does not really prove engineering aptitude, but a reflection of social capital, ability to afford coaching, and studying coaching institute material well (aptitude in rote learning). How about conducting more hand based practical tests and asking for SOPs to decide merit instead of competitive exams that valorizes rote learning as merit",
        "PhD admissions have written tests for screening followed by an actual interview for selection. In addition to this most IITs have a minimum CGPA like 8.0 to maintain in their first year to be allowed to continue. After joining the institute your PhD guide is not decided immediately after one year. In the first year, you are supposed to approach different professors for semester research projects and experience.",
        "All of these (especially interviews) could also be used to systematically exclude reserved category students. Allegations of casteism in IITs especially Madras has a long history and there have been instances of faculty members resigning! Ajantha Subramanian, anthropology professor at Harvard has written a full monograph on casteism in IITs and how merit have been used as a shield to cover up systemic institutionalised casteism",
        "I mean, it is definitely used to systematically exclude sections of the society. That is the reason we can't move away from JEE like tests, which are more fair than a MIT like admission style where the professors have full authority in rejecting someone.",
        "Personally I would like this to happen. But I am not sure if bulk of the population is privileged enough to practice hand based practical tests. SOPs, while good, can make luck a big factor in the shortlisting process.",
        "Or make it economic based. \nGive admissions to ppl who really are poor but also comparatively competent.",
        "How will a poor person gather enough resources to even prepare for getting into such high level institutions",
        "Piss off.",
        "Seems completely logical to me. Why should one get reservation in phd too? At that point of time they have had their bachelor & masters degree, and In most cases they would have used reservation in that too. So atleast phd should be on the same groud",
        "I don’t think JEE is used for PhD programs in IITs, it’s only for B.Tech. And also Rote learning will only get you so far in JEE, because IITs ask for the results of JEE advanced, which is a notoriously hard exam with little to no repetition of questions Every Year. The way to solve it is using properly developed skills to understand the question and use your experience to find a way of solving it. \n\nBut other wise I agree with all other points of you comment, JEE is much easier with coaching and proper study materials and some times materials other than that provided by the institute.",
        "That's what comparatively competent part comes into play.",
        "Senseless discussion to me. I have just accepted that if you want to do well just get out of the country. Instead of merit your background matters",
        "In medical field there is reservation at 1. Mbbs  2. PG 3. Superspeciality .\nWhy should the same person get reservation 3 times in studies and later at job level too .\nAt Mbbs level it’s understandable because people coming from a poor background with less opportunities in coaching and money .\nEven in Pg it’s okay to an extent .\nBut when there are very few seats in the Superspeciality I think the person who got opportunities in Mbbs and MD/MS through reservations can atleast try . The point of reservations is to bring people to the same level .",
        "Well, one big reason is just because admissions to PhDs are based on much more subjective evaluations by a faculty that is mostly upper caste?",
        "Bhai that's not the point here that who's the faculty  there. Point is at that level, where you already have bachelor's, Masters, and then PHD that too in iit B. So what's the point of reservation? It's not that you're uneducated or something or you haven't got opportunity. Let it be like that atleast there. And it's only about IIT B. You still have that at other places too",
        "Implement reservation for every category. Be it EWS for upper castes or ST for tribals.",
        "No the point of reservation is to get votes before elections. Mudi Z is the biggest culprit of this.",
        "PhD and M.Tech in IITs don't come from JEE.",
        "No reservation in superspeciality. It was abolished long back. Don't write something you don't know.",
        "I think there is no reservation in superspeciality courses till now.",
        "It's about getting into the program. Once you are in it, everyone is evaluated on the same exams. Same as bachelor's or masters degrees including medicine. \n\nIf you are going to tell me that a mostly upper caste faculty interviews and disproportionately chooses mostly upper caste students but that has nothing to do with caste and only merit, I don't believe that and I don't have to because there isn't even an attempt made here to be unbiased.",
        "Average r/India meritdhaari.",
        "> Bhai that's not the point here that who's the faculty there.\n\nthat is exactly the point, it is like reservation for the UC when there is no reservation for other castes. being in academic area for 20+ years and sitting on innumerable selection committees  so many times I have seen candidates being selected on basis of surnames than what they bring to the table. better candidates being rejected because the committee did not want people of LC in the institute\n\nThis is the point of reservation. UC people do and will discriminate on basis of caste when they get a chance and are in a position of power\n\n> And I think you should earn that with your hardwork & passion\n\nyou don't know how caste system/dynamics work because you have never experienced, and if hardwork & passion was the only case we would have been a more equal society already",
        "Then EWS children are also victims lmao. \n\nOfcourse there will be hostility if you give reservation on caste. \n\nThere was no discrimination against obcs but somehow suddenly obcs are victims.",
        "Got a problem. Spitting on reservation isn't wrong. It's a policy and criticism is allowed.\n\nThe fact that OBC reservation is even allowed is a shame. Obcs never suffer discrimination but since they are reserved they are now a victim.",
        ">Mudi Z is the biggest culprit of this.\n\nhaan kyunki wohi toh laaya hai reservation. Baaki neta toh karte hi nhi hai. Lalu yadav toh bilkul nhi. Mulayam singh, Akhilesh yadav, toh bilkul nhi. Modi hi sabse zyada hai, not like bjp said they were planning to remove reservation in some categories, but hey, mudizee only bad, i.n.d.i.a. neta all good, best",
        "THIS",
        "Nope you are wrong.\n\nI am doing PhD in IIT, the reason many Dalits are not in the IITs is because they have less opportunities to get educated and reach that level. I was fortunate enough for my grandfather to force me to study because he did not want a similar life for me as his. A lot of my brothers and sisters and uncles did not have such an opportunity to reach that level and work as garbarge cleaners, work in mortuary, work as labourers. A manual scavengers son/daughter would try to get employment and some money rather than risk his/her life with a PhD which is not that rewarding. \n\nAnyway we whine about reservations everyday but shut down ourselves conveniently when atrocities happen to the same Dalits. When they are pissed, paraded naked, murdered, raped, because casteism does not exist.",
        "IIT B did good.",
        "This is a sub full of privileged libs of course they downvoted you. The moment minorities get help from thee system they feel oppressed and forget the years of oppression the minorities faced.",
        ">Obcs never suffer discrimination\n\nYou need to go out more",
        "They don't it's a myth they do. Which came up only after reservation. You can be OBC in one state and general in another. Infact many Brahmins are in obcs and anyone can be added to it. Infact there have been more OBC judges in sc than kshatriya.\n\n\nThey discriminate ten times more than UCs and discriminate the most in india.\n\n Infact they have made open hate speech against all castes including UCs.",
        "By nerit you mean the surname? You have no idea how casteist selection committees can be. Subliminal preference given to students based on their caste is a real thing and that's exactly why reservation is needed. I hate when people who have never faced caste based discrimination act like it doesn't happen.",
        "I have friends who have EWS certificates but have businesses worth crores.",
        "These are merit-chods who don't object to management quotas in literally all private colleges, but have a problem with caste based reservation in govt colleges (far fewer than private colleges). \n\nThey don't have objection with people making their sons and daughters MD of their company and recruiting people through \"contacts\". But have problem when govt jobs give reservation to oppressed castes. \n\nThese are the same people who form less than 50% of Indian population, but get mad if 50% of Indian population gets 33% reservation.",
        "Wall of Hindi. Can you please atleat attempt to put it in english?\n\nNot all your co-citizens speak Hindi.",
        "Okay. Yeah it could be true. My apologies",
        "Gov needs to look into this as most generals leave india causing brain drain",
        "The only solution I count think of make some institutes which have full reservation taught by sc, st teachers. It can funded by govt. of india and sc/st/obc people who are rich enough to do so. The institute can be funded by govt of India and rich people in sc, st community.\nThis is way, upper caste teacher/students will  not downgrade the people with lower caste . Similar institute will be made for general people. This way, no one will complain against discrimination",
        ">I am doing PhD in IIT, the reason many Dalits are not in the IITs is because they have less opportunities to get educated and reach that level\n\nI didn't deny that, I am saying reservations at Phd levels isn't implemented. Why they don't qualify without reservation is a separate issue which among many many things would include the reasons you have mentioned.",

        "Majority of OBCs are former landlord caste who aren't rich because farming isn't really what makes you rich in today day and age.\n\nUnlike SC/STs they haven't suffered any systematic discrimination, there would be exceptions of course.",
        "> Mudi Z is the biggest culprit of this.\n\nThe OBC reservation implementation was literally a last ditch attempt by Congress under VP Singh to save it's government in 1991. \n\nThat bill has made a mockery of reservation argument by providing benefits to the very same castes who have been responsible for worst of caste atrocities and it keeps getting diluted by more such castes being added. \n\nAs long as VP singh and parties whose entire reasoning seems to campaign for more reservation exists you can't say what wrote with a straight face.",
        "This has the same energy as I know a dalit who drives in a BMW.",
        "I saw ultra rich students getting income based scholarships/tuitions in my college (top tier engineering institute in India). Income based opportunities are easily exploited in India.",

How about having a discussion about what constitutes merit? It can very well be argued that clearing JEE (and other competitive exams) does not really prove engineering aptitude, but a reflection of social capital, ability to afford coaching, and studying coaching institute material well (aptitude in rote learning).

Why should the same person get reservation 3 times in studies and later at job level too . At Mbbs level it’s understandable because people coming from a poor background with less opportunities in coaching and money . Even in Pg it’s okay to an extent . But when there are very few seats in the Superspeciality I think the person who got opportunities in Mbbs and MD/MS through reservations can atleast try . The point of reservations is to bring people to the same level . Well, one big reason is just because admissions to PhDs are based on much more subjective evaluations by a faculty that is mostly upper caste? Bhai that's not the point here that who's the faculty there. Point is at that level, where you already have bachelor's, Masters, and then PHD that too in iit B. So what's the point of reservation? It's not that you're uneducated or something or you haven't got opportunity. Let it be like that atleast there. And it's only about IIT B. You still have that at other places too Implement reservation for every category. Be it EWS for upper castes or ST for tribals. No the point of reservation is to get votes before elections. Mudi Z is the biggest culprit of this. PhD and M.Tech in IITs don't come from JEE. No reservation in superspeciality. It was abolished long back. Don't write something you don't know. I think there is no reservation in superspeciality courses till now. It's about getting into the program. Once you are in it, everyone is evaluated on the same exams. Same as bachelor's or masters degrees including medicine. If you are going to tell me that a mostly upper caste faculty interviews and disproportionately chooses mostly upper caste students but that has nothing to do with caste and only merit, I don't believe that and I don't have to because there isn't even an attempt made here to be unbiased. Average r/India meritdhaari. > Bhai that's not the point here that who's the faculty there. that is exactly the point, it is like reservation for the UC when there is no reservation for other castes. being in academic area for 20+ years and sitting on innumerable selection committees so many times I have seen candidates being selected on basis of surnames than what they bring to the table. better candidates being rejected because the committee did not want people of LC in the institute This is the point of reservation. UC people do and will discriminate on basis of caste when they get a chance and are in a position of power > And I think you should earn that with your hardwork & passion you don't know how caste system/dynamics work because you have never experienced, and if hardwork & passion was the only case we would have been a more equal society already Then EWS children are also victims lmao. Ofcourse there will be hostility if you give reservation on caste. There was no discrimination against obcs but somehow suddenly obcs are victims. Got a problem. Spitting on reservation isn't wrong. It's a policy and criticism is allowed. The fact that OBC reservation is even allowed is a shame. Obcs never suffer discrimination but since they are reserved they are now a victim. >Mudi Z is the biggest culprit of this. haan kyunki wohi toh laaya hai reservation. Baaki neta toh karte hi nhi hai. Lalu yadav toh bilkul nhi. Mulayam singh, Akhilesh yadav, toh bilkul nhi. Modi hi sabse zyada hai, not like bjp said they were planning to remove reservation in some categories, but hey, mudizee only bad, i.n.d.i.a. neta all good, best THIS Nope you are wrong. I am doing PhD in IIT, the reason many Dalits are not in the IITs is because they have less opportunities to get educated and reach that level. I was fortunate enough for my grandfather to force me to study because he did not want a similar life for me as his. A lot of my brothers and sisters and uncles did not have such an opportunity to reach that level and work as garbarge cleaners, work in mortuary, work as labourers. A manual scavengers son/daughter would try to get employment and some money rather than risk his/her life with a PhD which is not that rewarding. Anyway we whine about reservations everyday but shut down ourselves conveniently when atrocities happen to the same Dalits. When they are pissed, paraded naked, murdered, raped, because casteism does not exist. IIT B did good. This is a sub full of privileged libs of course they downvoted you. The moment minorities get help from thee system they feel oppressed and forget the years of oppression the minorities faced. >Obcs never suffer discrimination You need to go out more They don't it's a myth they do. Which came up only after reservation. You can be OBC in one state and general in another. Infact many Brahmins are in obcs and anyone can be added to it. Infact there have been more OBC judges in sc than kshatriya. They discriminate ten times more than UCs and discriminate the most in india. Infact they have made open hate speech against all castes including UCs. By nerit you mean the surname? You have no idea how casteist selection committees can be. Subliminal preference given to students based on their caste is a real thing and that's exactly why reservation is needed. I hate when people who have never faced caste based discrimination act like it doesn't happen. I have friends who have EWS certificates but have businesses worth crores. These are merit-chods who don't object to management quotas in literally all private colleges, but have a problem with caste based reservation in govt colleges (far fewer than private colleges). They don't have objection with people making their sons and daughters MD of their company and recruiting people through \"contacts\". But have problem when govt jobs give reservation to oppressed castes. These are the same people who form less than 50% of Indian population, but get mad if 50% of Indian population gets 33% reservation. Wall of Hindi. Can you please atleat attempt to put it in english? Not all your co-citizens speak Hindi. Okay. Yeah it could be true. My apologies Gov needs to look into this as most generals leave india causing brain drain The only solution I count think of make some institutes which have full reservation taught by sc, st teachers. It can funded by govt. of india and sc/st/obc people who are rich enough to do so. The institute can be funded by govt of India and rich people in sc, st community. This is way, upper caste teacher/students will not downgrade the people with lower caste . Similar institute will be made for general people. This way, no one will complain against discrimination >I am doing PhD in IIT, the reason many Dalits are not in the IITs is because they have less opportunities to get educated and reach that level I didn't deny that, I am saying reservations at Phd levels isn't implemented. Why they don't qualify without reservation is a separate issue which among many many things would include the reasons you have mentioned. wall of English. Not all your co citizens speak English Majority of OBCs are former landlord caste who aren't rich because farming isn't really what makes you rich in today day and age. Unlike SC/STs they haven't suffered any systematic discrimination, there would be exceptions of course. > Mudi Z is the biggest culprit of this. The OBC reservation implementation was literally a last ditch attempt by Congress under VP Singh to save it's government in 1991. That bill has made a mockery of reservation argument by providing benefits to the very same castes who have been responsible for worst of caste atrocities and it keeps getting diluted by more such castes being added. As long as VP singh and parties whose entire reasoning seems to campaign for more reservation exists you can't say what wrote with a straight face. This has the same energy as I know a dalit who drives in a BMW. I saw ultra rich students getting income based scholarships/tuitions in my college (top tier engineering institute in India). Income based opportunities are easily exploited in India. There is so much discrimination in academic field. PhD especially. IIT bombay is just the first case in the public eye Wasn't there a nature article on why there is no or very little SC/STs at PhD level? It is systematic oppression. [https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-00015-2/index.html](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-00015-2/index.html) Ok 👍 Statistics and logic is not our forte. W It’s there . Atleast in my home state I am sure . My cousin did Superspeciality TL;DR Modi is not the only to have brought more people under reservation. All political leaders such as Mulayam, Akhilesh, etc., also take the clutch of reservations. So why is modi the only one sindled out? English to hindi can be translated well and vice versa but Hinglish is really annoying because google doesnt detect it. Also lets not get into whataboutism :-) Congress under VP Singh mfw vp singh literally fought on janta party ticket and largest supporter was BJP. What makes someone an IITian is graduating from IIT. Not clearing the entrance exam to IIT. There is no reservation for passing exams and finishing courses. So your assumption that people from reserved categories are somehow less meritorious or don't deserve it is a foolish myth. Same for AIIMS or any other sector where reservations exist. I am glad, atleast they dont have to do phd in such shitty environment of iits, phd at iits is the most toxic thing ever dont come at me, seen this with my own eyes for a year now W IIT Bombay >All political leaders such as Mulayam, Akhilesh, etc., also take the clutch of reservations take the clutch? that's their whole/only game How dumb you have to be to not understand that reserved students are dumb af 😂 hey, could you check dm plss? 33% reservation? I don’t know what world you are in. Reservations are reaching 70% nowadays. Good Classical whataboutry by General category students despite claiming EWS whose cut off goes below OBC. OBC/SC/ST getting more marks than general still getting rejected in interviews. I don't think it's a coincidence it's pure discrimination. Ah yes I keep forgetting half a dozen new parties that got floated during that time, he was Congress guy for the longest time even was mildly reformative finance minister. My supervisor was decided before I joined the PhD at IIT. My co-supervisor was decided by the end of my first semester. our country needs the best engineers. not \"one sc engineer, one obc engineer, one st engineer, ... omg wow so much diversity 💅\" english is a language i learned because i enjoy it and its been instrumental to my wellbeing. i have a suspition that most of my co-citizens learned it for the same reason. hindi is a language i learned because it was imposed on me. while i do speak it, i dont think i should read or write it simply because i dont see the point in doing so. my comment was only a request whereas yours felt like an attack. reservations, while extremely important, seem to have actively kept some of the castes backward. in Karnataka, we have these workers from the interiors of Karnataka, who are hardwarking and intelligent. but wont study or become literate themselves since they can qualify for the bpl card which is a whole lot of subsidies and wealth. their papers are in top order, though! we have to make changes to the way reservarions/quotas are made so we can have real progress. Let me make a wild guess .... Every college in India has reservations. Government colleges have caste based reservations and private colleges have money based reservations or management quota or nri quota or whatever they call it. Most top tier colleges in the world including Yales and Harvards of the world also have some type of reservations in the form of affirmative action, alumni quota, donors quota etc. If you're purely 'meritocratic' in your thinking, you would be equally outraged by all types of reservations or accept it as a fact since everyone is doing it and move on. Your hate and moral outrage is only reserved for caste based reservations. Not for money and connection based reservations. It only reveals your casteist mindset. What's the use of wealth based reservation? Fee concessions should be enough for them, right? Point of reservation is to bring people to the same level of what?"
