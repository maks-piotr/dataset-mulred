        "I have earned 600 from them by liking youtube videos. Now I welcome this type of scammer.",
        "Sadly, some get too involved and get scammed\nThey make big time with those people.\nTrying to make awareness.",
        "What a sad state of the country.",
        "Do remember to go back and change all the reviews to 1 star and mention that they have paid to add this review....",
        "Do you think hotels are involved in this?\nGiving them 1 star, just seems wrong.",
        "Of course they are. Who else will pay money to give the hotels 5 stars except for the hotels itself?",
        "Possible ..... I recently was checking reviews for booking a hotel, and most of the hotels had a lot of 5 star reviews with minimal text... When I check the history of such users, within the same dates they would have given 5 star reviews to multiple other places (which are unrelated)....",
        "I dont think so, the main scam starts once you join there group on telegram, they will ask you to invest amount ranging from 1000 to 3lakh, saying in 10mins you will get the same amount back with some intrest.\n\nInitally for lower amount they will return you but as soon as you will think it's legit\nThey will keep giving task and asking more but wont release the initial amount.",
        "Trading your bank details for 200 rs? Doesn't feel like a gain to me.",
        "Na man, this was for the awareness.\nIt was not my main saving account.",
        "No issues then. It's just that the scammers are getting so advanced these days that it's super easy to make a fool of someone who is not \"technologically sound\".",
        "It's unfortunate that people have fallen victim to these scams. Let's hope that nobody falls for them in the future. The level of organization behind these operations is truly astonishing.",
        "Please remove the rating later too. Misleads a lot of people. I once went to a 5star rated hotel, already paid for in advance, the floor was full of used condoms. There were like 100 shampoo sachets on the bathroom floor and the bedsheet had rose petals from last night. I couldnt stay there for 5 seconds and I didn't get a refund too.",
        "I have removed.",
        "Yes, the hotels pay PR agencies/scam centers to get higher reviews. Why would scammers do a charity?",
        "I think they lure you into this one step at a time and get away with a bigger amount of money as you keep working with them. I would block them after they ask you for money instead of sending you.",
        "But all of your bank accounts have a common KYC which will reveal a lot more info.",

        "This is why I donâ€™t book regular hotels anymore. \n\nI started using Airbnb for my holiday homes and you canâ€™t do this kind of shit there",
