        "Reality is government employees are not even 50% effective I am saying on a complete average and without bribe they will not take business too.\n\nIt’s common sense that they need to cut down people but BCG can take blame if things don’t turn around 😝",
        "spends crores just to lay off 🕺🕺",
        "This is why governments use consultants. They are politically unwilling to make the decision, but then in this case they can point to high paid consultants ans say that 'they suggested it' and so the govt had to implement it.",
        "Profit over Quality Product/Service by any means necessary. We already saw the demo in our Railways and Health sector, with everything getting more expensive yet the quality worsening and people losing jobs left and right.",
        "$15 million deal, the partners must be enjoying martini and laughing at the foolishness.",
        "Then why is every single Chinese PSU anywhere from 5-10x bigger in number of employees and similarly big in terms of revenue? China Telecom and China Unicom have close to 300,000 employees each, with China Mobile having 450,000 employees?\n\nI'm not necessarily saying layoffs aren't necessary. Our government constantly bleeds money in every way, and bleeds like 600 million in case of BSNL, so cutting those losses might be necessary. But isn't expansion and development done through inducting more employees? I guess cutting those losses are necessary in order to appeal to the government to invest in BSNL further?",
        "These consultants are overpaid idiots who don't have any useful ideas beyond the  tropes like \"firing people increases efficiency and bottom line\". In reality, expenses go down over the next couple of quarters while tanking medium and long term prospects of the business. \n\n\nIn case of bsnl, lack of modernization is the problem, and that problem was deliberately created by Panauti Ji to help Mukesh launch jio. These 132 crores would have been better put to use upgrading infrastructure, if the intent was to make bsnl better. The intent is to make it worse and use that as a justification to sell it. Probably too Gautam or Mukesh. ",
        "It's not common sense at all. There's a long academically redrafted history of these consultant advised massive layoffs hurting businesses and government enterprises in medium to long term. ",
        "Literally the only reason why any business uses consultants.",
        "Difference in governing structures. The people have relatively less political power, and China can run their PSU at large scales with relatively lower curroption but worse employee conditions vs. an average Chinese citizen. Plus they need large PSU they need communism. This doesn't mean there are much more efficient as I believe both PSUs have yes men in their leadership.\n\nAnd taking a stepback and looking at overall telecommunications outcomes\nChina - great because of their competitiveness against USA\nIndia - great due to raising capitalism\nUSA - bad due to oligopoly",
        "BCG, McKinsey,Bain et al are leeches of the highest order. Another fumble on the way. Why does the government feel the need to support private players so much? Republicans in the US and BJP in India. Corporate bootlickers, but known as the 'party of the people'. Fucking shame.",
        "Do you really think BCG, a firm under investigation for corruption by the US Department of Justice, is not corrupt? The same company which settled the case by returning the profits(whopping 14 million USD) made by corruption is not corrupt?",
        "Sure, why not go to the guys responsible for the problems in the USA like Boeing. Surely they won't make the same mistakes as they made previously./s\n FYI Consultants in the 80s and 90s had dismissed the importance of the Cell Phone industry and called it a dying trend and never a sustainable business. Never let companies like McKinsey near your enterprise.",
        "Exactly. They need to have proper Graduate Trainee programs and Leadership/management Tracks instead of letting IAS babus and ministers head this shit.",
        "Isn't VRS good. Ultimately the telecom sector has changed drastically in last decade. They need personal focused on 4g, 5g, Fiber and satelite Internet instead of traditional landline \n\nHowever, don't let that distract you from the fact that government jeopardized BSNL by not giving them 4g and 5g band or forcing them to only get equipments from Indian companies leading to BSNL falling a decade behind Private players. \n\nAlso, If BSNL bring ridiculous offers like Jio did to win customers back, the government forces BSNL to withdraw it because of pressure from Jio and Airtel",
        "And why BCG? Isn’t there a single homegrown consulting firm capable of doing this for them?",
        "This Consulting is simply put a \"Due Diligence\" to look for hidden liabilities and any legacy issues before BSNL is sold off to AorA\n\n\nWait for the Masterstroke announcement soon...",
        "Exactly you have explained about the bottom line of every other corporate whose primary scapegoat his workers to cut down employee cost which is the predominant portion of operating expenses in order to be sustainable in the business and to be attractive to raise business proposals. Yes I do agree that the lack of modernisation is a problem but the main reason behind this is the immense growth of reliance jio and it paved the way to this kind of detrimental effect.",
        "BSNL in it's current form is inherently not competitive. They still have more administrative staff than technical staff. So VRS will be effective if subsequent restructuring is done. They should be having more engineers and should be upskilled from time to time.",
        "i have been through a bcg consulting project related to change mgmt, its often about pinning down accountability and laying down processes to ensure the accountability sticks irrespective of the person incharge. \n\nthis is difficult to work in government organizations because they have been bred in a low performance culture, right from the topmost level, the concept of accountability is alien to them and they get frightened about the prospect of losing jobs owing to reasons like incompetence, so their plans never get implemented because theres no executive sponsorship - as i said the mgmt hasnt ever felt the pressure of accountability in the past and for the rank and file employees unions get involved to resist change",
        ">but the main reason behind this is the immense growth of reliance jio and it paved the way to this kind of detrimental effect.\n\n\nYour confusing cause with effect. Bsnl was a leader in 3g before jio came into picture. When jio entered, jio was allowed to do so without paying costs of developing and licensing 2g, 3g etc. **while** bsnl was prevented from putting together 4g infrastructure for ages. This helped jio enormously. If bsnl was allowed to progress to 4g at the same pace as it was allowed to progress to 2g and 3g, reliance would have had to shell out way more than it did to undercut the competition. Jio's costs may have been forbiddingly high, if the playing field hadn't been tilted in its favour, and thus jio may not even have had the enormous infrastructure it managed to develop after killing the competition. ",
        "Organizations always hire consultants to insulate themselves from hard decisions.\nBSNL is bloated anyway.",
        "So in 15 f*cking million dollars they have advised to fire people, set the SOPs and priotrize the order? That seems basic to me.",
        "lol",
        "Nothing ever came out good from MBAs. These idiots are worse than uneducated politicians.",
        "They are going to help \"align\" it with market. What it means is it will allow Reliance and Airtel to raise prices. \n\nSo this could mean:\n\n- raising quality and price of BSNL \n\n- Selling off BSNL in parts\n\n- Firing people and lowering service and finding \"locked value\"\n\nMost of it will be asset survey, process study, equipment assay, service differentiation, segmentation study, pricing analysis, and a whole lot of PPTs.",
        "I am sorry, the quality was never better. Yes, they weren't as crowded, but quality, please!",
        "There are plenty of Indian policy thinktanks that could've done this analysis. Hell, I'm pretty sure any top institute in India like IIM or IIT could've done this. But I don't think they will be willing to get their names plastered in newspapers as the source of job cuts. The same goes for Indian private firms. With BCG, the government can still plaster their names all over the newspapers, and go ahead with the job cuts. BCG can't give two shits. Their firm doesn't run on Indian public sentiment.",
        "Why is BSNL still a thing and hasn't gone the Hindustan Motors or SAIL way?",
        "China works differently. Both private and public enterprises there run under the control of the government. If they decide that a nationalised telecom firm needs to dominate the field, they will ensure no competition comes in the way. If they decide that a certain space will be given to private entities, no public entity will compete. And most importantly, both private and public policies are laid out by the same government and accountability will keep lying with them because the government will never change and any unapproved corruption will lead to jail and maybe the death penalty. That's why when Jack Maa flew a little too high, the PRC eliminated the entire firm in the blink of an eye. Think of GOI dismantling Ambani and his entire family and business in 2 years. That's the level of control they have.",
        "Quality is only better if you're able to pay for things like Vande Bharat. Everyone else is suffering."
