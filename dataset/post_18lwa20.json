        "Opposition mukt parliament.  /s\n\nWe are in uncharted waters here . I think with this government can pass any bill in both houses. It suggests they might have some big bill in pipeline.",
        "BJP has absolutely no regard for parliamentary democracy. This is an openly authoritarian government, cheered on by a lapdog media and an electorate high on religion and nationalism. \n\nWhen the opposition stays silent, they are criticised for being ineffective and meek. When they protest and demand answers, they are suspended. All the while, the mainstream media parrots the government line. The junta carries on celebrating. After all, if Lord Modi has done it, he must be right.",
        "We are in the endgame now.",
        "Yes. This became clear when they suspended an MP who was not even present in the Parliament. The goal has been clearly to reduce strength adequately enough to ensure something big can be passed at one go without any debate, which might also include amendment to constitution.",
        "This!",
        "Sadly, many brainwashed voters of our country are rejoicing this. Godi media is debating the unruly behaviour of opposition and praising the suspension instead of questioning the PM/HM on the security failure. No hope left.",
        "Yeah. I wonder what bills they're planning? NRC? CAA? What else it could be that requires such a large expulsion of opposition MPs.",
        "Next Mother of Democracy also suspended 🤷‍♂️.",
        "Hindu Rashtra incoming. No way they are doing it doing it for making ruckus in the house. Its for something big coming up. A Mojor Major bill maybe a constitutional change requiring 2/3 majority to pass. Otherwise it does not make any sense.",
        "this has zero effect on elections. the public either is indifferent or elated that this happened. \n\na very sad state of affairs. this is the result of decade long campaign to make opposition to look either weak or evil or both. the opposition betting on sympathy/anti-incumbency which has never worked so far.",
        "Telegraph Bill for sure",
        "The opposition is least interested to rake up real issues like unemployment, inflation, deteriorating state of education, increasing poverty, unaffordable healthcare, ever increasing debt to GDP ratio, messed up policy making like how India lost so many projects to Vietman when manufacturers were leaving China en masse after Trump’s changes in policies, increased surveillance on citizens, etc etc. So many topics but opposition only focuses on slandering the larger than life persona of Modi which is not going to help. If you want to win, focus on issues which really bother the common man. Create a leader who articulate these issues and focus on them rather than deviating to 100s of non-issues making it impossible for the common man to resonate with them anymore.",

        "yeah. the brainwashing of  hundreds of millions is goddamn impressive as hell tho. \n\nthe media can spin anything in the govt's favour. the already convinced bhakts do the propaganda for bjp for free. it's irreversible at this point. the Overton window has shifted and there's nothing the opposition can do.\n\nwe can only hope they stop at targetting the opposition and their cadre.",

Except for slogans that change every year, i don’t see anything long term or any vision to improve shit. Maybe it’s still all jumlas like it was in 2014. Their bandage would be to spread so much propaganda people forget everything else. But kaun samjhaye. I don’t even think people even want solutions anymore. Or that they understand what long term solutions look like anymore.",
        "Definitely their real goal is a Hindu rasthra, but honestly? If I didn't know that the BJP were a bunch of fascists, Modi's development plan & the specific items on it would actually sound quite good to me.

There will be a time when they would want to remove the BJP for some other party (might not even be Congress). The problem is by then it'll be too late and they won't let go of their power. Why the fafda did they not do that during the World Cup Finals? We should have suspended a few pacers and a couple of batsmen from Australia. Hey, I've seen this happen before in a history book, I wonder if that caused a huge geo political situation? I might have to brush up on that topic soon. Dont forget Erdogan The live updates say changes to the penal codes...considering that they already suspended 141 MPs over nothing, deeply concerning what the new rules will allow eFIRs over. My relatives are mostly in MP and they like Modi's noise about upgrading infrastructure & making India a world leader. Of course, they don't care that he is all talk & corrupt action 🙄 How do you think that blocking the opposition permanently happens? You're getting exactly what you wanted. A real democracy involves living at times under a government you don't agree with. Some of my friends start their day at 7am, and end it at 10pm. No time to think, read etc. Whatever small time they get, they see journalist praise Modi, so thats what they think. Working like a slave is also a part of this equation. 2 bills - telecommunications bill and broadcast bill which- a blatant and fascist attempt to gain full control over social media. The provisions of the broadcast bill are very dire. godimedia has done its job perfectly. people are too much brainwashed now. chaddi media will show this as fault of opposition too. all agenda and scripts, all shows will be on how bad opposition is. And BJPee already has control of all social media. No way opposition is winning it. yeah. the brainwashing of hundreds of millions is goddamn impressive as hell tho. the media can spin anything in the govt's favour. the already convinced bhakts do the propaganda for bjp for free. it's irreversible at this point. the Overton window has shifted and there's nothing the opposition can do. we can only hope they stop at targetting the opposition and their cadre. Where did you hear it? Democracy actually died when our parents and grandparents let indira pull that emergency bs and screwed the country for years with the decisions she made in that period. What can you do with these idiots. Today I saw a clip of Modi saying it’s his dream that every poor with chappal can fly in airplanes…? How are these clips even popular 😂 And I swear, never saw poor people believing in this shit. yeppp...the problem though is that opposition is selling nothing except short-term bandage solutions. (And of course there's a lot of \"oh Congress is buying Muslim votes\" 🙄) Bhai mai kya hi bolu. apko haal hi nahi malum kya hai. Supreme court judges are worried about democracy and our population is super happy apparently if I see social media. Isme opposition kuch nahi kar sakti. sorry. I don’t think even BJP has any long term solution or vision except for consolidation of power. Except for slogans that change every year, i don’t see anything long term or any vision to improve shit. Maybe it’s still all jumlas like it was in 2014. Their bandage would be to spread so much propaganda people forget everything else. But kaun samjhaye. I don’t even think people even want solutions anymore. Or that they understand what long term solutions look like anymore. Definitely their real goal is a Hindu rasthra, but honestly? If I didn't know that the BJP were a bunch of fascists, Modi's development plan & the specific items on it would actually sound quite good to me. Opposition needs to learn sloganeering backed up with just enough action to seem believable. Reddit and yt So nothing concrete? Just rumours that can’t be substantiated? How is this not illegal News laundry *if you want to check Till when are we going to blame the past and not worry about future?"
