        " If you find yourself in a situation like this, it's important to take the following steps:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't Panic: Stay calm and composed.

Responding to their demands can encourage further exploitation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDocument Evidence: Take screenshots or record any evidence of the video calls, messages, or threats. This documentation could be useful if you decide to involve law enforcement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlock the Caller: If possible, block the unknown caller's number or contact information to prevent further communication.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecure Your Online Presence: Review your privacy settings on social media and other platforms. Make sure only your trusted contacts can access your personal information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInform Trusted Individuals: Share the situation with close friends, family, or colleagues so they are aware of what's happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReport to Law Enforcement: If the situation escalates or if you feel threatened, consider reporting the incident to your local law enforcement agency. Provide them with any evidence you've collected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsider Professional Help: If the blackmail is causing emotional distress, it might be helpful to talk to a mental health professional or counselor who can provide support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChange Passwords: As a precaution, change your passwords for your online accounts to prevent any unauthorized access.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEducate Yourself: Learn about online security and safe online practices to avoid such situations in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to involve law enforcement and seek legal advice if you feel your safety or privacy is at risk.

    "light_cleaned_title": "Did I just get saved from a scam?",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I hope y'all have heard about the recent news of unknown numbers video calling people. The person recieves the call, sees a black screen for a second or two, and then the call ends. Hours later the person gets blackmailed with edited photos of him and so on. I searched the number on Truecaller, the name is on Slide 2. Thoughts?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "In WhatsApp, there's an option to make your profile picture public. It's not necessary that the alleged scammer saved your number Yes I'm aware. My suspicion was born from the DP of the number, which is a stock photo from the internet. A simple Google Lens search will show that. no offense bro but you only tell me which girl would openly put their dp knowing launde piche pad sakte he and then proceed to call a random stranger such as yourself? Bhai [stock photo](https://stock.adobe.com/be_fr/images/portrait-of-pretty-young-indian-woman-with-long-hair-isolated-over-colored-background/167304289) hai. Random photo from internet. A simple Google Lens search will show that. Maybe Prkash meena got a sex change surgery, who know, its 2023 after all. /s I mean yeah!! that's obvious...😆 snapchat filters se me thodi na esa flawless composition me dikhegi bandi, wo bhi koi spotless background ko leke? photoshop ka bhayanak skill (i mean look at the edges of her hair; lasso tool se ye kia toh perfect kia gaya he ya fir proper studio ka hi he). wo nahi toh ai ka kamal he. An uglier variant of the scam that capitalises on peak tharak is they suddenly have a hq video off nude person or an actual half dressed woman on the other end, get the horny receiver to get off on screen, then they record, threaten to put up the video online and blackmail ensues. Or it could be another dude getting off, they target numbers registered to women’s names. Yes. Pro tip - never reply to messages from scammers. Block them directly. They won't waste time on you and will move on to the next person who is scared and would pay easily. I just reject myself. There's also a \"fake\" policeman involved who will talk in heavy hindi dialect to tell the victim that an FIR has been written and then ask for money. This is a fact right here. Prakash became meena .. then he became prakash again .. Why would anyone answer a video call from an unknown person? I barely answer video calls from people that I know let alone an unknown person. If curiosity is getting the best of you maybe try to place a finger on camera and answer? > but you only tell me which girl would put their dp Yeah, the idea is to divert the victim's blood supply from his brain to another organ. Already done bhai. I've blocked at least 20-25 spammy and scammy contacts already. Bhai tu akela nahi hai 🥲 Call + yourself, right? even if she real too good for me . Instant block. Just to clear it out - I didn't accept the call. I have the WhatsApp filter on which silences calls from unknown numbers. I later checked my phone and found 2 back to back missed calls from the number. lol bro!! you should write a 101 on this subject- I'll read it! Yes sorry, I was pointing to people who do fall for this scams. I refuse to believe that such an innocent cute looking girl would steal anything. The only thing she steals is men's hearts. Bhai 😭 Sorry Bhai but itna Sundar ladki terko message nahi karne wali. Obvious scam. Us bro us If you tell that pulisman that you will go to the station he is posted or the FIR is filed at at with your lawyer, even Premchand will be left speechless at the depth of Hindi swear words. There’s a version where the girl’s brother will call the victim after the pulisman, then very gently demand money to revoke the FIR. I have a special idea to deal with such scammers..... Just creste another message where it states..if u give missed call to this number...you will get (so n so status or whatsapp msg that ur aadhar is linked with mobile no(confirmation)...or if u r giving a missed call...ur vote will be considered for so and so cause...) and then circulate it in all the Whatsapp and Telegram groups... its a chain reaction...within hrs such idiots will receive thousands of missed calls from anonymous numbers !! Thats the best way to give it back.... Apna face or iski dp ka face dekhke thoda to drr jata be 😂 They say Mewat is the new Jamtara. Someone should do an AMA from over there.🤞 Just report these mfs :) lol She clearly loves you bro /s what's the diff b/w _spammy_ and _scammy_ Yeah am getting such types of messages and calls on a daily basis. Easy enough to identify as spam though I don't pick video call of people I know. So I am not scared of this scam. But need to be satark. bhai that whatsapp pfp looks so sus ki mai hota to call tak na utha ta Yeah OP needs to report that number to cyber cell. Meena is a Title too in Rajasthan so could be real name. It's not a scam. Those are just the different personalities of that one girl. Photo bhi aosi lagate h yakeen hi na ho If you actually want an answer - spammy could consist of phone calls made by customer services belonging to various registered companies who are not out there to scam you. Whereas scammy is def meant for you to get scammed. It generally starts with random friend request from a sweet looking girl on FB. Once you accept they go through your profile and if you are active get to know your family , friends etc. Then a message on messenger like How are you ? Next thing she asks if you want to have a video sex chat on whatsapp where a girl is masturbating herself nude and asks you to do same. Your video is captured using a software and then unknown people call you telling you that they will send this video to your relatives / friends and or make it viral. Many cases have been registered against these scamsters but nothing stops this activity. ahh, i see, I didn't know they were different. Thanks. Mereko toh acchi bandi bhi nahi message karti I barely pick normal calls from an unknown number lol. That’s why I don’t pick unkown callers , atleast not without truecaller I don't pick call. Period Yup. My friend opened pants for her. Later she blackmailed. He sent Rs. 10,000. She demanded more. He complained to police. She sent his dick pic to everyone in his insta friend list. Including his parents. Bro was embarrassed af agibwo (ageebo) gareeb log hai🤣🤣🤣 It's to filter out last level despo's Que? Why did you hide the number? Bade level ka tharki tha aapka dost! Of late a lot of potentially fake facebook profiles are also being created in our/friends's name. It is quite hard to discriminate from the original for a common man. I guess this is definitely a wrong use / abuse of technology. It is unfortunate that our cybercrime abatement unit of Law Enforcement is still almost negligibly nil when compared to the intensity of these scam/spam. Apnu shakal dekhta hu roz, I know if she's a real person won't call me even when drunk 🤣😅 I put my phone on DND when i go for movie. Thus got saved from such a call. Hehe Yaar aisi DP ke saath koi call kare toh apne aap ko aaine mein dekh leta hoon. Andar wala scam karke chilla deta hai… did not know abt this feature, just enabled it for me and parents. thanks! What is the scam here? Please share kar diyo DM mein. Aparichit 2.0 That dp looks fake af and generated by AI I barely answer audio calls lol. If you wanna say something to me, send a voice msg thank you. Try ysense :- . I have made $95 from here so far. Dm me if you need any tips on how to use it. I once masturbated with the girl she took the video and threatened me I asked do you know SEO she answered no I said then fuck off no one wants to see a giant man whacking his small penis In some ways, scammers intentionally make their scams easy to identify to knowledgeable individuals so that they don't waste their time with marks that will ultimately figure it out before handing anything of value over. Yesterday I got a call from Fido (Canada) with a recording of woman that had a STRONG chinese accent telling me I had issues with my account and I need to return their call. Anyone that makes that call back is EXTREMELY vulnerable and thus can be scammed by the real paid employees. What did you think? She will use SEO and bring your video on top of search results I mean I wanted to be a pornstar in my early teens That's a scam from a kilometer away. The real scam is there is no black screen, someone plays preedited porn of a women undressing now they got your face on that video call, after which they ask you to pay x amount or they will send it to all your relatives and friends. Sounds like experience(??no??) I got video calls and calls from South Africa, Bangladesh and Pakistan on WhatsApp for some reason which is just idk WEIRD. How do I even protect my WhatsApp from these creeps I have never met in my life? Why do you do this bro? Depression ka Kami nahi hai mera zindagi Mai. ;_; I got such calls a few times but it doesn't even ring for a second & gets rejected automatically. Idk if it's a feature in WhatsApp or my phone but I'm glad it does 😂 Always send abusive words to scammers, they leave you immediately. Nah, I have way too gullible senior citizens whose kids live abroad, in my life that I have to watch out for, so yeah, need to stay ahead of these shitheads. If you read your city’s local language paper these are practically daily scams. Haha, that's a solid tactic! Finger on the camera defense mode activated! What happened? Amma ivaru periya manmadha kunju poda dei. How's that 🤣🤣 Exactly this, I get anxiety attacks even when my own mom does a video call to me instead of a normal one lol Not a scam Even if someone is dumb enough to get easily blackmail like this . The best way to get away from this is \"GTFO\" GET THE FUCK OUT AND BLOCK THEM . F this scummy scamers.. If found they should be dealt publicly, scanning decent honest hardworking people Nah man she's just a transgender. Yes, you got escaped from a scam. It can be sextortion cases. You might also get a WhatsApp message where people ask you to just share and like the Utube videos for money. Be aware of the latest cybercrimes that are happening. In my view, the greed of some people and the desperate need of some people are major reasons for this kind of crimes. And that's exactly why I don't accept random friend requests, even if they're friends with my friends on Facebook. If you want to be my friend on Facebook you'll have talk to me personally after I had some time to get to know you and then we'll the whole process sitting next to each other where we can look at each other's screens. smol pp My dad got a video call like this on his company phone number and he picked up thinking it was his coworker with the same name. Black screen of course and then he cut the call. Had to make him understand to never pick up calls from strangers or reply to them. He also got a message like this from another number💀 I’m worried for older people getting trapped into scams like these. meaning Que? Once i was peeing n i switch it to back camera then black screen was disappeared 👻 n didn’t get any video call further There's a grammatical error in the text describing the offer of this scammer. It'll be \"each task\" not each tasks. My anecdote: I actually grammar corrected a scammer once before blocking them. 😂 Bhai me toh apno ki bhi nahi uthata Indian uncles 💀 Those calls are usually targetting older chinese people, perhaps parents or grandparents of younger immigrants, who may or may not have a knowledge of English or French language. Sometimes, young 17 yo also fall for this scam. I get those Fido Chinese calls all the time. Sometimes evennat 10 pm. Poor SEO skillz Fortunately mere isme zyada divert honeki jagah hi nahi... Isiliye mein bachh jaata hu inn cheezo se. A wise man once said 'no one wants to see a giant man whack off his small penis' Us bro us 🙁 Scam is super common lately and with the use of AI morphing photos have become super easy, got to know about a tool that helps in case your photo has been compromised. Will share the link might help some folks Another fun thing to do is to send them cartel execution videos or such gory shit to traumatise them why did i imagine a guy with pot belly laying in bed shirtless brushing his hands through chest hair with one hand and the other to hold phone to face what's with United States now bro I think your dad might have signes up in some porn site I don’t think so. It’s his company number. He would never take a risk with this particular number. He never gets stuff like this on his personal number. I mostly try to refrain from video calls with my mom cause she starts pointing out stuff wrong with me like my beard (even though it's shaped and trimmed) and even stuff like designed t-shirts. She'll be like you're wearing some dark or depressing stuff. I just hang up. Ik that's nothing compared to your case but still wanted to share. meaning Yeah that's exactly what it is. They are targeting vulnerable populations like elderly people and immigrants. Same reason there are clear red flags in some E-scams, it's because they are trying to get to the people that are tech illiterate enough to carry through the difficult part of the scam (handing over info). lund ke sath izzat aur 10k bhi kat gaye Que? If someone can't even spell something as basic as their name right, then I'd immediately categorize them as spam. *got Maybe they had a gender transition surgery 💀👍 Maybe Goldy brar with a different name. what the hell is a pulisman Lack of 😺 Enable this option in Settings>Privacy>Calls. Calls from unknown caller will automatically be rejected. You will only get a notification informing you about it. Yea that meaning I don't even answer calls. Anyways, a legitimate person will leave a voicemail Sab gyaani hai idhar! jab khud ko call aayega toh at least some people will fall for it. At that moment, dimaag itna kaam nahi karega :) If this does happen with anyone, just act nonchalant and say you don't care if they release your deep fakes or whatever. They probably have a full database of such pics/videos and try to Target people who will get scared so they can easily manipulate them. Say if they want you can send them more videos with better angles. They won't waste their time on you once they get to know you don't care. A similar thing happened to a guy friend of mine. Not the video call. But he matched with a girl on tinder who asked him to do the sexting video call thing I don't know what it's called. She filmed and blackmailed him. He told me he got really scared but played it cool. They didn't do shit. If you find yourself in a situation like this, it's important to take the following steps: &#x200B; Don't Panic: Stay calm and composed. Panic can cloud your judgment and make the situation worse. &#x200B; Don't Respond to Blackmail: Do not engage with the blackmailer. Responding to their demands can encourage further exploitation. &#x200B; Document Evidence: Take screenshots or record any evidence of the video calls, messages, or threats. This documentation could be useful if you decide to involve law enforcement. &#x200B; Block the Caller: If possible, block the unknown caller's number or contact information to prevent further communication. &#x200B; Secure Your Online Presence: Review your privacy settings on social media and other platforms. Make sure only your trusted contacts can access your personal information. &#x200B; Inform Trusted Individuals: Share the situation with close friends, family, or colleagues so they are aware of what's happening. &#x200B; Report to Law Enforcement: If the situation escalates or if you feel threatened, consider reporting the incident to your local law enforcement agency. Provide them with any evidence you've collected. &#x200B; Consider Professional Help: If the blackmail is causing emotional distress, it might be helpful to talk to a mental health professional or counselor who can provide support. &#x200B; Change Passwords: As a precaution, change your passwords for your online accounts to prevent any unauthorized access. &#x200B; Educate Yourself: Learn about online security and safe online practices to avoid such situations in the future. &#x200B; Remember, it's always a good idea to involve law enforcement and seek legal advice if you feel your safety or privacy is at risk. If you are unsure about the best course of action, consult with professionals who can provide guidance based on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Its wise not answer any random unknown call. Scamming business is skyrocketing in india. If your number is with one scammer, it's also present with 100 other scammers I would suggest to block all unknown numbers It's definitely a fake..First a policemen will cal u telling about some investigation and ask u money and will show u fake FIR copy.Later they ask more to Remove the video.. Don't worry .They can't do anything..If they again harrass u ,go local cybercrime department.. ( I have seen these case 3 times..Everytime somebody from Fake Delhi police called.) I found myself in a similar scam. I never picked up the call tho. Excuse me it's Parkash, not prakash a fake police man. Buy one of those Modi masks and keep it handy Uske dental clinic ka opening tha usi Sunday. Uski saari family ke chehre pe tension tha uss din. Yaar chehre se toh shaant sa aur kamjor lagta hai wo. Ab que na khna 😭 Glad he was loyal to aunty and told you 😭 god knows kitno k dads in kaamon mien phasty hongy >In some ways, scammers intentionally make their scams easy to identify to knowledgeable individuals so that they don't waste their time with marks that will ultimately figure it out before handing anything of value over.
