        "Watching \"The Middleman\" by Satyajit Ray. If anyone wants to watch it, it's available on Youtube with English subtitles.\n[Here's the link to movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEMA1upF0rw)",
        "Currently watching Psych for the first time. What a fun show! \n\nAny suggestions similar to this when I'll eventually be done? \n\nFinished Sons if Anarchy last month and is left a hole. Tried Handmaid's Tale, stuck with it for 3 seasons, not my thing.",
        "Call my agent | Netflix (French comedy-drama series). At first you think there is nothing new except a bunch of peopleâ€™s work life and drama around that, but it holds your interest for all four seasons.\n\nTehran | Apple TV + | spy - Thriller | This is another Israeli thriller that grabbed my attention after Fauda (Netflix). Both series are good in trying to be as real as possible. Surprisingly neither shows the other side completely bad the way most American or India content would do. This one in particularly about Iran-Israel. Fauda is about Israeli- Palestinian conflict.",
        "Watched The Talented Mr. Ripley on Netflix. And old psychological thriller worth a watch. \nAlso watched the Mauritaruan and The Courier, both good movies.",
        "The Long Goodbye \n\nReally Enjoyed watching this movie, so much so that I'm gonna start reading the Philip Marlowe series from next month.",
        "got myself a 55 inch TV, so I am rewatching Our Planet on netflix. almost every single frame of the show is stunning enough to be kept as a wallpaper",
        "'I have heard it both ways.' \nScrubs may be, if you like Psych.",
        "Watched yeonmi park podcast with joe rogan. If you want to feel good about yourself watch it. It is about life of normal people in north korea.",
        "There was a South Indian series recently on liv with a murder storyline. I just watched some ads and want to see the movie/serial. Can someone help me figure out the name? It was launched this/last month",
        "I have just discovered kdrama and HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!! I did not know what I was missing. I love cheesy romcoms and kdramas are full of it. (Not every kdrama is romantic, but there are a lot of them). Also now my expectations from relationships have soared so high that I am pretty sure, I'll die single. So far I've watched My Love from the Star, Legend of the Blue Sea, It is Okay to Not be Okay, The King: Eternal Monarch and Hi School Love On. \n\nWould strongly recommend watching It's Okay to Not be Okay to everyone because it is amazing, the characters are very well written, the supporting cast is awesome, it is sweet and funny, emotional and dark, really a mixed bag.",
        "Started watching the white lotus , interested to see how they make it more engaging. Watched till the second episode.",
        "The Red Line is a great podcast. They discuss various geopolitical issues with a range of experts on the topic. I just watched an episode on the Tigray situation in Ethiopia. The first part (there were three parts to the episode) was fantastic",

        "Try BoJack Horseman as well. Insanely good show.",
        "Red Web is a good podcast on Internet mysteries, cryptids, unsolved mysteries and some true-crime as well. New episodes come out every Monday.\n\nDarknet Diaries is another great podcast that you should try out. It deals with the info-sec side of things a bit more, but you can feel the amount of work and research that's gone into making each episode.

Well, we all are waiting for the third season, I heard that the producer/some personnel gave the actors an open contract/freed them from contract.
