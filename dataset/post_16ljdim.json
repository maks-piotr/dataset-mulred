        ">Sources said Partap Singh Bajwa, the Leader of the Opposition in Punjab, and Delhi Congress leaders Ajay Maken and Alka Lamba voiced concerns about an electoral tie-up with the AAP. While Bajwa pointed out that the sentiment of the party cadre of Punjab was against any understanding with the Arvind Kejriwal-led party, which is in power in the state, Maken said the AAP was putting up candidates against the Congress in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Maken is the chairperson of the screening committee for picking candidates in Chhattisgarh. Bajwa also told the CWC that if the ruling party and the main Opposition party in Punjab join hands, it will help the BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal.",
