    "url": "https://v.redd.it/ezgb41rmeh5c1",
    "selftext": "A little background: I am a 1st year B.Sc Student enrolled in Delhi University. I came to Delhi to enrol in a regular college because I am originally a resident of Kolkata. Yesterday, I left my hostel to go to the gym and en route saw a huge procession of people, presumably aged 20-25, waving ABVP flags and law enforcement personnel protecting them.\nThe consequent traffic was simply atrocious, for a lack of a better word. People having to give up 30-40mins of their time simply stuck in traffic being unable to go back or move forward, and the traffic persisted for 3+hours. I saw Ambulances stuck in the traffic as well. I don't know what I would have done if my loved one was in a critical condition and we were stuck in traffic due to this reason. Maybe I would have become a vigilante and got blood on\nmy hands. Is there nothing we can do to\nstop this? How are the law enforcement people condoning this? You CANNOT disrupt a public area like this, no matter what your reason is. It will never\nbe justified. It's simply outrageous how the\ncommon man has to always receive the shorter end of the stick and be inconvenienced when they are\nnot at fault. What can we do to prevent this? What can I, as a student, start doing so I can make an impact? How is this not a crime? Impeding people's work and stealing people's precious time? Not to mention the enormous amounts of waste generated during these events. Attaching video for reference; Disclaimer: I DON'T have a problem with any person/group expressing their opinions/exercising their right to speech/ right to express themselves. What I do have a problem with, however, is as simple as you cannot exercise your right at the expense of someone else's right/ someone's time. Time once lost can never be compensated for.",
