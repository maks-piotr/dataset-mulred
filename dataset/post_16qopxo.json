Is there some marketing strategy behind this, perhaps similar to how malls design escalators to pass by as many shops as possible?\n\nAdditionally, I wonder why they have two booklets in the first place. Could it be because they have two high-paying front-page ads that they can't afford to lose? Do other newspapers employ a similar strategy of using two booklets and this cross-linking complexity?\n\n[https://imgur.com/eOMAjM2](https://imgur.com/eOMAjM2)",
