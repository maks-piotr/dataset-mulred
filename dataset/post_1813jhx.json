Photograph: Harish Tyagi\\/EPA ](https://preview.redd.it/23eslgv6lu1c1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9d3c8d1714e0cf8a2a0bf3455df46f63ea7d91a)\n\n>\"Modi’s model is at last revealed for what it is: violent Hindu nationalism underwritten by big business ,Modi's brutal treatment of Kashmir exposes his tactics – and their flaws\" \n\nArundhati Roy\n\nThe actions of prime minister Narendra Modi’s government in the past few weeks have shown how many more clampdowns await. Desperately in need of distraction tactics – given the many failures in governance, tackling inflation or delivering jobs – the regime is after a fresh dose of sound and fury against political opponents.\n\nAnd so a decade-old case has been dusted off, paving the way for initiating legal proceedings against the novelist, journalist and activist Arundhati Roy for comments she made in 2010 about Kashmir. The Kashmiri law professor Sheikh Showkat Hussain has also had charges against him approved. It comes after police raids on the homes of more than 40 journalists in Delhi and elsewhere. They have been slapped with terrorism charges and had their phones and laptops seized. They were working for NewsClick, a **website accused of having funding links with China**: **a charge denied by both the website and its funders.**\n\nThe original complaint against Roy is based on comments she made at a conference in New Delhi where she said Kashmir – the region disputed between India and Pakistan – has never been an “integral” part of India. **Shorn of context, these words were used by the right to portray Roy as an “anti-national”.** She has been charged for “offences related to provocative speech and the promotion of enmity between different groups”.\n\nUnleashing the state machinery against Roy shows that the Modi regime has crossed the Rubicon. In millennial speak, no other Indian writer has similar flex on a global level. The legal proceedings set to be launched against Roy are therefore a testing ground. **Once the regime realises that it can go after Roy without a big reaction, it’s open season on all publishers, editors and authors. What’s more, the scourge of self-censorship already tempers any potential criticisms of the state. Fear feeds our silences, but none of this makes headlines. The ripple effect of what will follow the public bullying of Roy is scary.**\n\nIt will certainly embolden the **vast troll armies that exist virtually, and their members and supporters who inhabit the streets.** This won’t be just a one-off case – **they will go after anyone who has made the slightest whimper of displeasure against the regime.** **I also fear that the ruling party, the BJP, and its affiliated student groups will take it to the next level.** **The last nine years of the regime has been replete with demands that the work of dissenters be removed from university syllabuses. Educational institutions will become the next contested site for rightwing bullying.** Drawing strength from the action against Roy, they might **disrupt peaceful meetings**. Inspired by this case (and that of opposition politician Rahul Gandhi, who was disqualified from parliament before being reinstated), **underlings of the regime would prove their loyalty and quench their thirst for publicity by using the legal machinery to file cases everywhere against those who criticise the ruling party.**\n\nSo why is the government doing this now?\n\nFirst, against the broader international backdrop of the intensification of the superpower rivalry between US and China, the **Biden administration has made wooing India to its side a key part of its geopolitical strategy. US imperialism needs India as a regional bulwark against China – Modi’s visit to the US in June was pivotal from that perspective. Aware of its indispensability, Modi’s regime knows it can get away with a lot.** In assuming that India has rising geopolitical (and to an extent economic) value for the west, the regime feels more confident to scale up its attacks against domestic political opponents without fearing too much backlash. Perhaps it has overplayed its hand.\n\nSecond, facing a groundswell of opposition and criticism across the country on many issues, the BJP does not want to leave anything to chance ahead of next year’s general elections. **Unaffiliated to any political organisation, unafraid when the riot act is read to her, unflinching in her criticism of the corporate cronyism that underwrites the hate-mongering Hindutva political programme – Roy embodies an opposition to everything the BJP stands for.**\n\nNaomi Klein, John Cusack, Yanis Varoufakis – figureheads of the international left, openly addressing Modi on X (formerly known as Twitter), have asked him to keep his hands off Arundhati Roy. I**f the global outcry manages to reach a climax, the world’s unanimous outrage to protect its favourite literary hero might have the side-effect of protecting the dwindling remnants of free speech in Indian democracy.** Within India, too, as an emboldened opposition under Rahul Gandhi seeks to consolidate itself, the attack on Roy might well transform into a national talking point. The ruling party has coined the advertising campaign of India being the “mother of democracy” to showcase itself globally – but the sheer optics of launching this petty attack on Roy might serve the purpose of galvanising public opinion against it.",

As a great nation, we cannot go back on it. We have left the question for final solution to the people of Kashmir. And we are determined to abide by their decision.”  \n   \nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru writing in Amrita Bazar Patrika, Calcutta, 2 Jan 1952:  \n“If, after a proper plebiscite, the people of Kashmir said, ‘We do not want to be with India’, we are committed to accept that. We will accept it though it might pain us. We will not send any army against them. We will accept that, however hurt we might feel about it, we will change the Constitution, if necessary.”  \n   \nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru speaking in the Indian Parliament, 26 June 1952:  \n“I want to stress that it is only the people of Kashmir who can decide the future of Kashmir. It is not that we have merely said that to the United Nations and to the people of Kashmir; it is our conviction and one that is borne out by the policy that we have pursued, not only in Kashmir but every where.  \nI started with the presumption that it is for the people of Kashmir to decide their own future. We will not compel them. In that sense, the people of Kashmir are sovereign.”  \n   \nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru in Telegram No. Primin-304 dated 8 November 1947 addressed to Prime Minister of Pakistan:  \n“We have always right from the beginning accepted the idea of the Kashmir people deciding their fate by referendum or plebiscite. Ultimately, the final decision of settlement, which must come, has first of all to be made basically by the people of Kashmir\"",

There are thousands of people, if not millions who sincerely believe that the election was rigged and that Trump actually won. Does the US justice system go and arrest people who said that on Facebook or at some political party convention ? No. It specifically arrests people who turned up to prevent the election from being certified and stormed the US Congress. And it's prosecuting people like Trump who fueled the angry mob and instigated them to do what they did.\n\nThat is the distinct line that I referred to at the beginning. Words cannot be absolute, that is for certain. Defamation, incitement to an offence, hate speech, etc. are clearly instances where you can't just say \"freedom of speech\" and move on.

It was a moment of realization for Kashmiri nation that their deep held beliefs and sentiments would court no listeners until they are backed by the barrel of a gun. The seeds of insurgency has long been planted by then.  \nOn 29 September 1965, decades before the insurgency would erupt, thousands of students gathered hand in hand and marched to the UN HQ and proclaimed the following resolution.  \n\"We shall fight in the schools, we shall fight in the colleges, we shall fight in the streets, we shall fight in the villages, we shall fight in the towns, but we shall never submit before the might of Indian imperialism. Either we shall perish or we will triumph\" - (Kashmiris Fight for Freedom, vol. II, pg. 1263.)  \n\"Although the Plebiscite Front already existed since long, demanding a referendum, the Kashmiri youth had already taken to radicalism. Throughout the end of 1965, massive student protests spread across, with participation of both men and women. Many were killed in firing. The military barged into the vicinity of Hazratbal. The Plebiscite Front leadership came out in support only later, and the whole affair was followed by a spree of arrests, of students, and of Plebiscite Front leadership.\" - (Kashmiris Fight for Freedom, vol. II, 1263–6; Nida-i-Haq, pg. 323.)  \n\"The students and youth went on to form a hierarchical string of cells, headed by the Master Cell, to launch covert operations against India. The cells organized protests, printed and issued posters, ferried weapons and taught their usage, and facilitated infiltration across the Ceasefire Line.\" - (India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad, pg. 58–9)  \n\"By 1965, on one side of the LoC, the National Liberation Front had been formed by Amanullah Khan and Maqbool Bhat, while on the other side, by 1968, posters of a map of India with Kashmir in red, as a separate entity, were being mailed to different people, and a low-profile political resistance organisation, Jammu Kashmir Revolutionary Front, had been launched in Srinagar. A group styled after the Palestinian Al-Fatah had emerged by late 1968, and with it, armed struggle began in Kashmir.\" - (Making of Al'Fatah, Farman Ali)",

        "Wrong\n\nIs Kashmir an 'internal issue' of India or an International problem?  \nIt was India itself which took Kashmir issue to UN under Chapter VI of UN Charter, which deals with resolution of international disputes. So, India from that point implicitly affirmed that Kashmir is an international dispute. UNSC resolutions have no expiry date and remain binding on its members. So attempts to bilateralize Kashmir dispute, or make Kashmir an internal issue of India has no legs to stand on.  \nThis point is further explicitly corroborated by a long list of assurances made himself by the first Indian Prime Minister JawaharLal Nehru. Just quoting one relevant statement made J.L. Nehru on the floor of Indian Parliament in 1952  \n“It is an international problem. It would be an international problem anyhow if it concerned any other nation besides India and it does. It became further an international problem because a large number of other countries also took interest and gave advice…. We do not want to win people against their will and with the help of armed force, and if the people of Jammu and Kashmir State so wish it, to part company from us, they can go their way and we shall go our way. We want no forced marriages, no forced unions….\"  \n—Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament on August 7, 1952.\n\n  \n**Why has India denied Plebiscite?**  \nInstead of trying to flesh out possible intentions, it's better to learn the truth from the horse's mouth.  \nWhen V.K. Menon, India's Minister for Defense and second most powerful man after Nehru, was asked why India refused plebiscite; he candidly declared:  \n\"Because we would lose it. Kashmir would vote to join Pakistan and no Indian Government responsible to agreeing to the plebiscite could survive.\"  \nFurther more, he conceded that  \n\"There may be neither legal or moral justification for India's position on Kashmir, but the question was not what was right, but what was opportune.\"  \n\\[Citation\\]: Arthur Tourtellot . \"Dilemma of a People Adrift. \" Saturday Review.

The fact is that in criminalizing simply voicing an opinion they are trampling your rights. \n\nThe constitution and the amendments were all passed by the govt following due process ratified by all. In a constitutional democracy, there is always a majority and a minority, and it is a firm belief that somebody's rights are always trampled. \n\n>Because what the current government is doing to Roy is functionally identical to what was done to the likes of Gandhi and Savarkar.\n\nApples and Oranges. British Indian Govt was not a constitutional democracy, India is. The people make the laws through their reps and they have the right to throw them off the power when they feel shortchanged.",
        "Sounds pretty much the same shit the Indian state says. Call it bs but can't give any credible evidence to counter the truth. Try shouting louder that Kashmir valley is an integral part of India and maybe the make believe will become the truth sometime. You should also shout out loud that kashmiris love the Indian army and their daily harassment",
        "YOU can say whatever, doesnt change the fact that Kashmir is part of INDIA and will always will be. If people are not happy, they can leave for Kashmir or China. Pakistan has already sold half of the POK to the Chinese already. \n\nSo yeah keep BSing, doesnt change FACTS. Hari Singh signed the documents to be with India. You and your ilk can try. We know how to handle people like you. \n\nNow shoo, go away.",

        "Don't disagree with you completely, but Texas and other southern states literally went to war with the Union to secede from the union. It was the civil war. \n\nIreland also had a history of lot of communal violence before it split into Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland.",
        "I think you should too cos anyone who has ready anything about Kashmir or been there or seen any documentary about it will connect with what I've said.",
        "Get a grip",
        "Don't disagree with you completely, but Texas and other southern states literally went to war with the Union to secede from the union. It was the civil war.\nYeah, but it was a full blown civil war. It’s not like either of the parties carried out mass killings of civilians and hide in the bushes. They fought the first industrialised war with mass weapons and good triumphed over evil in the end. My point is there were no proxies or suicide bombings like scales of which we see from radical Islamic terrorists. \n\nIreland also had a history of lot of communal violence before it split into Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. \nI recall “isis” calling to take up arms in Ireland and some Irish dissidents reportedly had links to left-wing extremists and have traveled across the EU to take part in socialist and Marxist events. So go figure..",
        ">Individuals like Roy are nothing but promoters of their  toxic extremism, backed by Pakistan and China, operating through POK, utterly disregarding the rest of the state's population.\n\nHave there been any connections made between her and seditious forces beyond sharing common political idealogue? Because if she is just an intellectual, digging up dirt in her statements is not a good look for our authorities.",
        "You see Kashmir is partly in India, which they acceded , Pakistan snatched some and gifted some to Chin and Chinis have Eastern part \n\nKashmir is Not land dispute its want \nIt's part of India and Pak and Chin snatched some of it and little bit of extremism etc.\n\n\nIn Palestinian occupied apartheid colonial regime that's based on hate and Land dispute and geopolitical power struggle cocktailed in imperialism \n\nThese are way diffrent problem",
        "I have come to a realization that there are no facts now, only opinions and that too negative opinions by media. I am myself living in a non democratic country and the safety for everyone here is so good that i just don't miss free speech/democracy. Always criticizing someone without working on solution would never bring any positive outcome. Criticizing is good but upto a limit. Due to social media and free speech, everyone just criticize and not do anything else.",
        "Isis is not a left wing group lmao..... Not sure about what you're trying to say",
        "Standard of living and democracy/personal freedom aren't necessarily connected. I mean look at Singapore for example.",
        "Singapore also doesn’t have much of free speech. It is v much restricted by government.",
        "We are using a single dimensional limited understanding of our complex history and transposing it to the modern context to judge anything, anyone who has a different opinion, prematurely.  In ancient Indian history, we were neither proponents of democracy, nor freedom of speech or justice.  \n\nMajority believes, the might is always right.  In our collective consciousness dictated by might, people like Arundathi Roy are bound to be demonised and hounded in the garb of modern terminologies like National sovereignty, country. Even though the context of issue is complicated that takes us back to times where the notion of India was non-existent.",
        "It was in a different context when I said “isis chief al Baghdadi called upon Irish people to take up arms and some of them were arrested in links with isis. My point is Islam supports these types of proxy wars and influence people into carrying out terrorist. Left wing extremists also supported Irish separatists. Those 2 might or may not be linked. \n\nI believe religion is a primary source of evil in this world, it includes Hindus, Jews, Christian’s and every religion on earth. but Islam turns people into brainless zombies to carry out barbaric attacks on innocents and terrorising the world. But yeah, religion in general is the culprit.",
        "It worked pretty well in China. It has its faults but developed them to where they are now. Maybe in 50 it will move to free utopia like progressive twats wants in china. Progression or development of society is likes going through stages and not by utopian fanatsy.",
        "China's authoritarian development has come at the cost of basic civil rights and freedoms. Yes India could try and pursue China's path. It would involve most people losing the ability to critically engage with their government.\n\nYour problem of course would be simple. Today you see Roy as an acceptable sacrifice for the sake of development. You're fine with that. Tomorrow however you could be the sacrifice. And something tells me you'd be far less sanguine about that. If that makes those of us trying to defend basic civil liberties, progressive twats, so be it.",
        "I or you being a sacrifice or not sacrifice doesn't matter in developement. you are just a cog in the system\nSociety develops like this. Europe developed like this, America same, china now India. Nothing new.",
        "Thats exactly what I mean. It is objectively less free than India, but has amongst the highest standards of living in the world.",
        "But you cant say literally anything. By this logic religious hatred is justified",
        "bro all he is saying that we are better than these countries, which is contrary to what the reports say",
        "he means that we are not that bad",
        "Yes, there are exceptions to free speech. Hate speech is one of them. However, simply discussing the matter of Kashmir is not hate speech. It's civil and healthy conversation. The union of Kashmir to India is an extremely complicated and nuance subject and there are many differing opinions regarding the matter. Simply having an opinion and discussing the topic should not be a jailable offense. That's how authoritarian dictatorships function.",
        "May be you are right but i feel that putter limitations to democracy help government fo us on progress rather than putting focus on replying to every free speech media person.  For ex: BBC making reports on India, government has to spend their cricial time responding",
        "I see what you mean friend, and sure I think that India probably can not just go full wild west \"total freedom\" mode without serious negative effects. Honestly though, I think moderation is necessary or things are going to spiral out of control.\n\n I mean for gods sakes, people are saying that Roy should be extra-judicially shot for this, which again was an incorrect stupid statement. In fact I myself have gotten multiple replies/messages saying that I should be jailed or killed, and I'm not even backing separatism, only disagreeing with prosecuting her!",
        "Le moot diya tere usoolon pr. Ja ke ro le. Kashmir is a part of India, and it will be a part of India no matter what you think.",

Photograph: Harish Tyagi\\/EPA ](https://preview.redd.it/23eslgv6lu1c1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9d3c8d1714e0cf8a2a0bf3455df46f63ea7d91a) >\"Modi’s model is at last revealed for what it is: violent Hindu nationalism underwritten by big business ,Modi's brutal treatment of Kashmir exposes his tactics – and their flaws\" Arundhati Roy The actions of prime minister Narendra Modi’s government in the past few weeks have shown how many more clampdowns await. Desperately in need of distraction tactics – given the many failures in governance, tackling inflation or delivering jobs – the regime is after a fresh dose of sound and fury against political opponents. And so a decade-old case has been dusted off, paving the way for initiating legal proceedings against the novelist, journalist and activist Arundhati Roy for comments she made in 2010 about Kashmir. The Kashmiri law professor Sheikh Showkat Hussain has also had charges against him approved. It comes after police raids on the homes of more than 40 journalists in Delhi and elsewhere. They have been slapped with terrorism charges and had their phones and laptops seized. They were working for NewsClick, a **website accused of having funding links with China**: **a charge denied by both the website and its funders.** The original complaint against Roy is based on comments she made at a conference in New Delhi where she said Kashmir – the region disputed between India and Pakistan – has never been an “integral” part of India. **Shorn of context, these words were used by the right to portray Roy as an “anti-national”.** She has been charged for “offences related to provocative speech and the promotion of enmity between different groups”. Unleashing the state machinery against Roy shows that the Modi regime has crossed the Rubicon. In millennial speak, no other Indian writer has similar flex on a global level. The legal proceedings set to be launched against Roy are therefore a testing ground. **Once the regime realises that it can go after Roy without a big reaction, it’s open season on all publishers, editors and authors. What’s more, the scourge of self-censorship already tempers any potential criticisms of the state. Fear feeds our silences, but none of this makes headlines. The ripple effect of what will follow the public bullying of Roy is scary.** It will certainly embolden the **vast troll armies that exist virtually, and their members and supporters who inhabit the streets.** This won’t be just a one-off case – **they will go after anyone who has made the slightest whimper of displeasure against the regime.** **I also fear that the ruling party, the BJP, and its affiliated student groups will take it to the next level.** **The last nine years of the regime has been replete with demands that the work of dissenters be removed from university syllabuses. Educational institutions will become the next contested site for rightwing bullying.** Drawing strength from the action against Roy, they might **disrupt peaceful meetings**. Inspired by this case (and that of opposition politician Rahul Gandhi, who was disqualified from parliament before being reinstated), **underlings of the regime would prove their loyalty and quench their thirst for publicity by using the legal machinery to file cases everywhere against those who criticise the ruling party.** So why is the government doing this now? First, against the broader international backdrop of the intensification of the superpower rivalry between US and China, the **Biden administration has made wooing India to its side a key part of its geopolitical strategy. US imperialism needs India as a regional bulwark against China – Modi’s visit to the US in June was pivotal from that perspective. Aware of its indispensability, Modi’s regime knows it can get away with a lot.** In assuming that India has rising geopolitical (and to an extent economic) value for the west, the regime feels more confident to scale up its attacks against domestic political opponents without fearing too much backlash. Perhaps it has overplayed its hand. Second, facing a groundswell of opposition and criticism across the country on many issues, the BJP does not want to leave anything to chance ahead of next year’s general elections. **Unaffiliated to any political organisation, unafraid when the riot act is read to her, unflinching in her criticism of the corporate cronyism that underwrites the hate-mongering Hindutva political programme – Roy embodies an opposition to everything the BJP stands for.** Naomi Klein, John Cusack, Yanis Varoufakis – figureheads of the international left, openly addressing Modi on X (formerly known as Twitter), have asked him to keep his hands off Arundhati Roy. I**f the global outcry manages to reach a climax, the world’s unanimous outrage to protect its favourite literary hero might have the side-effect of protecting the dwindling remnants of free speech in Indian democracy.** Within India, too, as an emboldened opposition under Rahul Gandhi seeks to consolidate itself, the attack on Roy might well transform into a national talking point. The ruling party has coined the advertising campaign of India being the “mother of democracy” to showcase itself globally – but the sheer optics of launching this petty attack on Roy might serve the purpose of galvanising public opinion against it.",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "screw all religious nationalism as well as jingoism. Well our system is slow as a snail. The scams done under congress are still under progress, when bjp has been in power for 2 decades. So this is not surprising at all. People like Arundhati are one of the reasons why many people refuse to associate with the left. what did she do? Kashmir has always been, and should remain as an independent entity. 100% Kashmir is integral part of India man, and she denied it. She was trying to incite violence by saying so. Thats why I hate her too. Yeh bas foreign mein sharan lene ki ninja technique hai iski. Every government has its first and foremost obligation to maintain the integrity of the nation. Any action, vocal or action, against it should be treated immediately. It is actually a shame from the previous governments to drag these cases these long. Where did you learn history bro comic books ? Kashmir was temporarily attached to India and it is accepted that whatever the people choose it's final and they never got a chance to vote for it . But when it isn't part of the nation, refused to join the nation, but the nation said \"we don't care, we will claim you as part of the nation, even if you don't wish to be\", where does that leave your circular argument? Dekh bhai, tereko India mein nhi rehna ka hai toh mat reh. Chala ja kahi aur. Par aisi desh todne ki baat na kiya kar. just do a plebsticide and find out. Instead of trying to flesh out possible intentions, it's better to learn the truth from the horse's mouth. When V.K. Menon, India's Minister for Defense and second most powerful man after Nehru, was asked why India refused plebiscite; he candidly declared: \"Because we would lose it. Kashmir would vote to join Pakistan and no Indian Government responsible to agreeing to the plebiscite could survive.\" Further more, he conceded that \"There may be neither legal or moral justification for India's position on Kashmir, but the question was not what was right, but what was opportune.\" \\[Citation\\]: Arthur Tourtellot . \"Dilemma of a People Adrift. \" Saturday Review. March 6, 1965. p. 18 Q-A4: When did India promise Kashmiris directly it will respect their will? Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at Joint press comm. of the PMs of India and Pak issued in Delhi after their meeting on 20 Aug 1953: “People seem to forget that Kashmir is not a commodity for sale or to be bartered. It has an individual existence and its people must be the final arbiters of their future.” Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru speaking in the Indian Parliament, 12 Feb 1951: “We have taken the issue to the UN and given our word of honour for a peaceful solution. As a great nation, we cannot go back on it. We have left the question for final solution to the people of Kashmir. And we are determined to abide by their decision.” Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru writing in Amrita Bazar Patrika, Calcutta, 2 Jan 1952: “If, after a proper plebiscite, the people of Kashmir said, ‘We do not want to be with India’, we are committed to accept that. We will accept it though it might pain us. We will not send any army against them. We will accept that, however hurt we might feel about it, we will change the Constitution, if necessary.” Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru speaking in the Indian Parliament, 26 June 1952: “I want to stress that it is only the people of Kashmir who can decide the future of Kashmir. It is not that we have merely said that to the United Nations and to the people of Kashmir; it is our conviction and one that is borne out by the policy that we have pursued, not only in Kashmir but every where. I started with the presumption that it is for the people of Kashmir to decide their own future. We will not compel them. In that sense, the people of Kashmir are sovereign.” Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in Telegram No. Primin-304 dated 8 November 1947 addressed to Prime Minister of Pakistan: “We have always right from the beginning accepted the idea of the Kashmir people deciding their fate by referendum or plebiscite. Ultimately, the final decision of settlement, which must come, has first of all to be made basically by the people of Kashmir\" do you respect the will of kashmiri people? Sahi hi kaha gaya hai, chutiyon se jabaan nahi ladate. Unko 'tu sahi hai bhai' kehke aage badh jana chahiye. Tu sahi hai bhai. Aur Kashmir is in India. India ranks 161 out of 180 in press freedom index. I saw the website where ranking is given and it seemed to be a joke. There are many countries where there is no Press at all forget about free press and they are ranked above India. so i just donot believe in your highlight. I donot follow Arundhiti Roy so cannot comment on it. But you seriously don't understand how much freedom of speech you have in India. Visit the countries who donot have and try speaking against that country in front of any govt building and you will get to know. I have seen the actual will of Kashmiri people in 1990. Good. Kashmir is an integral part of India. Anybody who says otherwise is a traitor and should be prosecuted with the harshest punishment. True, it analogous to China claiming huge swathes of islands and coasts of the south China Sea, which incidentally India opposes, which is a tad hypocritical. Jab usool ki baat na karsako to personal attacks aur gaaliyon par utar jao. A plebiscite after ethnic cleansing of oundits has the valudity of a tissue paper. this is what happens if you hold people against their will eventually they revolt. But you are ok with islamic nationalism in kashmir? As much as I respect the will of every other Indian. Where did they say they dont want to join India? The kashmiri violence started in the 70's after islamic radicalisation . so in other words you don't have data to prove your claim. eat shit (which you already do) hindutvadi. Plebiscite among the wolves after they cleansed all sheeps? But he said screw ALL religious nationalism, didn't he? Seriously, why do you spend millions of dollars on mititary forcing people to be part of an entity they obviously don't wish to be. Answer the question. Oh blame some nebulous terrorists, of course. Logic doesn't suit you, dies it. Just let them do their own thing. I'm not suggesting any other country be allowed to annex them. Read about the forces instrument of accession. are you talking of [jammu massares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Jammu_massacres) that was commited by RSS? in logo ko theek sei padna nahi aata hai. muslims were majority even before that. Tu sahi hai bhai!! But Kashmir is part of India and always will be!! Kya kare, ab inko ache se samajh hi nahi aata, aur saalo ki jaat hi aisi hai ki sabhi jagah gaali sunne ki aadat hai. Koi dikkat nahi, ab jise jis tarike se samajh aaye hum use uski bhasa mein samjhayenge. So? You mean every muslim would surely vote for a islamic country? Haha, I am a leftist man, but not a country breaker. Tereko US ya kahi ka visa chahiye toh bol mereko, main araam se dila dega, uske liye desh todne ki jarurat nahi. Samajh Gaya tum ek uncivilized barbarian ho jisko baat karne ki bhi tameez nahi hai. Bas aake bhounk rahe ho jab kuch bol nahi sakte. Typical chaddi reply. Let me tell you, any individual can say anything, how cynical. In a free society it’s allowed. If people get influenced it’s their own will to do so. Governments cannot control and jail folks. To supress a seditious movement. What is not understandable about that? Why should I allow my nation to break up? Those asking for it can also just let go of their terrorism and simply stop it. Everything will just settle after that. Bhai, main khud leftist hai re. Par desh todne wala nhi hai. It isn't your nation. It's theirs. But you are so much like the Chinese \"claiming\" everything. Sad. Yeah whatever. by that logic every muslim should surely vote for an islamic country. Any individual CANNOT say anything, when it's against the collective stability of society itself. When that happens it will be the governments responsibility to take care of that. No society allows freedom to do anything. With murder of innocents? Pray tell me how rapes and cutting people in half counts as \"revolt\". They don't. Thats my point. You are essentially arguing hypotheticals as there was no vote in 1947 anyway. hindutvadis also did that in 1947. Can't you even read the comment before replying? In Jammu, yes. So the solution is taking revenge on people whose only common link to Hindutvavadis is their faith? That too 33 years later? This movement is for, by, and of Muslims. They ought to claim it as such instead of giving it that bullshit veneer of Kashmiri separatism. ever heard of [Kashmir Sultanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Sultanate)? I am talking about the last 600 years from sikander shah to Aurangzeb to 1990s. What happened to the local Hindus? And if India leaves what will happen the little fraction that is remaining? You can't leave sheep among the wolves, even if they're the majority. *2 terms So your argument is look at the worst examples and then say how much better we are? And who gets to decide it’s against a society or not ? Everyone’s perceptions stem from their own beliefs. If that was true than Nicolas corpenicus would be killed when he said earth is round and not flat like y he Catholic Church wanted. If a country’s government is so fragile that a singular statement is disrupting the society it is on them itself. People aren’t puppets to follow anyone, they would only believe others if they want to believe it. I am done with this, you sound like a right winger sanghi. Go get a job and a education. Tu Sahi hai bhai. innocents were murdered by militants that were flooded in by pakistan, not from our side. This post reminded me of a dialogue in Thor Ragnarok. \"Asgard is not a place, it's the people\". So we have Kashmir as the King signed to join India but do we have it's people? That's the biggest question. There's a very distinct line between saying something and acting upon it, or urging other people to act on what you said. Terms like \"collective stability of society\" are very easy to throw about, but they are extremely subjective in interpretation and can easily be misused by those in power. Just look at the Jan 6th insurrection in USA led by Trump. There are thousands of people, if not millions who sincerely believe that the election was rigged and that Trump actually won. Does the US justice system go and arrest people who said that on Facebook or at some political party convention ? No. It specifically arrests people who turned up to prevent the election from being certified and stormed the US Congress. And it's prosecuting people like Trump who fueled the angry mob and instigated them to do what they did. That is the distinct line that I referred to at the beginning. Words cannot be absolute, that is for certain. Defamation, incitement to an offence, hate speech, etc. are clearly instances where you can't just say \"freedom of speech\" and move on. But simply raising an opinion without calling for violence or asking people to take the law into their own hands is perfectly acceptable in all mature democracies. And it's fucking sad that India ain't gonna let its citizens have that basic right anytime soon. >I am done with this, you sound like a right winger sanghi. Go get a job and a education. Ohh. Okay... I think calling for national integrity makes me Hindu nationalist now. Also I have a fairly good job and education. \"Oh hey look at that other dictator oppressing its citizens ! Our country doesn't do that. Wow so lucky we are !\" If we're claiming to be a democracy, we need to at least try to compare our standards with actual democratic nations. It doesn't matter Hyderabad was also annexed, the opinion of people mattered 7 decades ago, when the minority was given the option to choose between India and Pakistan. Those who have stayed/joined shall remain here now. Doubt it. “Good” definitely isn’t the worth. they will treat how india is treating non-hindus. instrument of accession was temporary. Even letter of Accession itself notes the temporary nature of Accession in following points: Point 8: Nothing in this Instrument shall be deemed to commit in any way to acceptance of any future constitution of India or to fetter my discretion to enter into agreement with the Government of India under any such future constitution. Point 9: Nothing in this Instrument affects the continuance of my Sovereignty in and over this State, or, save as provided by or under this Instrument, the exercise of any powers, authority and rights now enjoyed by me as Ruler of this State or the validity of any law at present in force in this State. India later took the dispute to UN Security Council under Chapter VI of UN Charter which also ruled in the favor of impartial plebiscite. See UNSC resolutions numbered 47, 51, 80, 91. India has since unilaterally denied the plebiscite, used the temporary accession to take control of Kashmir and entirely subjugate it through violent military occupation. Not to mention that India has even violated conditions stipulated within the letter of Accession itself which only granted it power in three areas viz Defense, Communications and Foreign affairs and killed any autonomy it had to grant in this temporary set-up. Further reading: [Instrument of Accession](https://cjp.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instrument_of_accession_of_jammu_and_kashmir_state.pdf) Yeah, sure. >national integrit kashmir isn't national integrity. it has since the start said that they want a separate nation and people of kashmir want a separate nation, they don't want either pakistan or india. The non Hindu fraction in India grew since 47. The opposite happened in the Islamic brothers that separated. So no trust. Agree with your point, but that's not what u/International_Dig_79 was pointing out... What was the full context of the speech ? I aint judging one line in a speech unless I learn the context. I am not an idiot. but you have to respect the promise our country made in the past. the instrument of accession was temporary. our previous prime ministers promised that he would respect the plebiscite. so why can't you also respect it? Op. Why are you here in r/India? India as a nation did not exist before 1947. If the Indian government wanted to give special treatment to kashmir, why was not the same treatment extended to all the princely states which were assimilated into india? Actually if we did, we would end up with like 20 countries fighting with each other constantly. Even today, punjab, bengal and many other states demand separate country. I don't understand where the buck stops. It's not a bad country to live in compared to the neighbouring countries. the same Arundhati roy that virtue signals in media while abusing, assaulting and enslaving her domestic help workers and laborers and then intimidated them from seeking legal recourse using her contacts in the upper echelon of society? She can get fuked. No sympathies here. Also, i'm not gonna do moral grandstanding, India needs the kashmir region for its strategic security. we need the geography, if the people on it come with us peacefully well and good, if they don't, they too can go fuck themselves, either move out or can get rekt trying to resist. Our territorial safety comes wayyyyy before their silly little feelings. Wtf. Actually I'm not surprised anymore. You guys aren't even trying to hide that India is slowly becoming more and more authoritarian cuz i am indian. And what about the rajouri massacare and three other massacares in Kahsmir of hindus in 1947? And what should we do about it? It is a integral part and anyone asking for separation should be treated like burhan wani. No place for Islamists. No it was kahmiri muslims who started the killing that's when your so called opression started in 1990. Before that there was no army or encounter in Kashmir. No he didn't lmao. He never signed a official document. Rather what the official document says has been done. BR Ambedkar was a traitor TIL but there are secular separatists as well. Lmao secular separatists. You mean JKLF since they call for a independent state? Not a single thing about them is secular. The idea of free Kahsmir rises from the false accusation that nehru is a hindu leader of hindu india who took over Allah Kashmir. JKLF members and start of kahsmirs independence movement is rooted in Islamism They deserve what is happening to them after they decided to support the Islamist coalition in 1990s against congress Look at the mirror, and Say that 50 times everyday in the morning for a month. You will be a changed person. This type of speech is not criminalized in Many countries. 161 out of 180 is utter bs. My instagram feed is full of AI modi voice songs from Chaleya to HoneySinghVolume1 . Even tamil and telugu songs lmao. Absolutely ridiculous. Can y'all at least please admit that such separatist speech would absolutely be legal in most free countries? And that India is clearly less permissive in terms of speech than, the USA for example? So did the Sikhs, Bengalis and Marathas! What's you point? Hell, the Ahoms have their ancestral root in SE Asia, so are we going to consider Assam as separate from India? >They deserve what is happening to them after they decided to support the Islamist coalition in 1990s against congress after they manipulated the [1987 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Jammu_and_Kashmir_Legislative_Assembly_election#Extent_of_electoral_malpractice:~:text=The%20election%20is%20widely%20perceived%20to%20have%20been%20rigged)? Government does not have responsibility to create jobs, that is left to businesses. Businesses will always try to extract most from existing manpower before creating new jobs. Only people who do not have jobs are the ones: 1. Not ready to invest in one's skill development 2. Preparing for Government or Bank jobs 3. Not ready to move out from their location The coalition opposing Congress in 1987 was a Islamist coalition filled with members who will be JKLF leaders. They threatened pundits and argued for a Islamist constitution with Sharia after Indian constitution was removed and asked many separatist demands. India was right to throw the coalition leaders in jail and manipulate the elections. They voted for that coalition and now they should bear the fruits. Don't associate with the left then. I am no lover of left or Roy, but simply on principle each one of us must be free to say controversial things, as long as we are not inviting violence. How different is this from Muslim nations freaking out regarding Satanic Verses or Charlie Hebdo cartoons. And which are these countries where you cannot do that? if jklf is as islamist as you think it is, then why is it also fighting pakistan? That ranking is horseshit, but India absolutely is sliding backwards in terms of free speech, and is less free than many Countries in terms of restricting speech that is harmful to national security or stability. So what does that mean? India is a hub of free speech ?! ideally somewhere in top 25 to 50 but defo not close to the bottom. lol ever heard of kashmiris and minorities being thwarted with uapa just for expressing their opinions online? Go to the link and start seeing the countries just above India. You will yourself realize You’re talking to a guy who thinks that being a model minority for murican conservatives means they won’t one day turn on him and eat his face. Good dude thinks Modi AI singing songs is true freedom of speech # WRONG 1987 was just a breaking point. A cinematic explosion after a volcano brewing underneath the surface of Kashmiri body-politic erupted for the world to see. It was a moment of realization for Kashmiri nation that their deep held beliefs and sentiments would court no listeners until they are backed by the barrel of a gun. The seeds of insurgency has long been planted by then. On 29 September 1965, decades before the insurgency would erupt, thousands of students gathered hand in hand and marched to the UN HQ and proclaimed the following resolution. \"We shall fight in the schools, we shall fight in the colleges, we shall fight in the streets, we shall fight in the villages, we shall fight in the towns, but we shall never submit before the might of Indian imperialism. Either we shall perish or we will triumph\" - (Kashmiris Fight for Freedom, vol. II, pg. 1263.) \"Although the Plebiscite Front already existed since long, demanding a referendum, the Kashmiri youth had already taken to radicalism. Throughout the end of 1965, massive student protests spread across, with participation of both men and women. Many were killed in firing. The military barged into the vicinity of Hazratbal. The Plebiscite Front leadership came out in support only later, and the whole affair was followed by a spree of arrests, of students, and of Plebiscite Front leadership.\" - (Kashmiris Fight for Freedom, vol. II, 1263–6; Nida-i-Haq, pg. 323.) \"The students and youth went on to form a hierarchical string of cells, headed by the Master Cell, to launch covert operations against India. The cells organized protests, printed and issued posters, ferried weapons and taught their usage, and facilitated infiltration across the Ceasefire Line.\" - (India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad, pg. 58–9) \"By 1965, on one side of the LoC, the National Liberation Front had been formed by Amanullah Khan and Maqbool Bhat, while on the other side, by 1968, posters of a map of India with Kashmir in red, as a separate entity, were being mailed to different people, and a low-profile political resistance organisation, Jammu Kashmir Revolutionary Front, had been launched in Srinagar. A group styled after the Palestinian Al-Fatah had emerged by late 1968, and with it, armed struggle began in Kashmir.\" - (Making of Al'Fatah, Farman Ali) he's high on Modi's chai [you are just looking at the tip of the ice berg](https://x.com/Ahjazmir_jk/status/1726298978529218992?s=20) Kashmir was a vassal state when she said it, like Hong Kong, Transnistria, Puerto Rico, Macau. 2019 is the year when India *integrated* Kashmir. Good Any proof of the abuse on her part towards her help? Thanks. Jeez ok hitler Sanghi go drink gau mutra. What an utterly disgraceful reply section. When it comes to Kashmir, even indian liberals turn into Adolf Hitler Kashmir is an integral part of India, those who disagree should be neutralised and considered as an enemy of the state. there’s a thin line between freedom of speech and questioning the sovereignty of the India. I’d suggest everyone to look at “unknown men” phenomenon going on in Pakistan, Canada and other countries. Be aware! >principle the issue I and many in the center have is that these principles are applied very selectively. why should I accept these principles in some cases and not in others? I am all for freedom of expression, religion, etc. but if people on the other side are against my expressions, my religion, etc. then why should I fight for them? Any nation does not tolerate separatism. Anyone who wishes to harm its sovereignty is an enemy. Questioning the state on how administration can be done, corruption, and many other factors are permissible and encouraged. But all that goes out of the window, the moment it's sovereignty is questioned. If traitors think they can play and skirt with law and ideals to gut this nation for their desired ethno or religious state, then they are wrong. No Indian will have any shred of sympathy for those who wish to destroy and separate this nation. India has flaws. India needs to do better for its people. But without question, it is the best thing that has happened to the South asians in generations. I don't know if you were dropped on the head as a child or something. USA had a civil war, which they won, and because of that any talk of separatism in USA sounds like a pipe dream. India is less permissive of such separatist talk because it always results in ruin. We learnt the painful lessons of partition. What's wrong with demanding a separate nation if the majority are for it eh? The Scots even had a referendum on it. Isn't a nation basically it's people? Dont twist his words. He always supported India's stance. Kashmir was an Integral part of India in 47', it was an integral part in 90' and IT IS AN INTEGRAL PART now in 2023 and will continue to be. Anyone disagreeing can go fuck themselves. >And who gets to decide it’s against a society or not ? The Government (both centre and state) gets to prosecute and the courts get to judge. This is how it has been since at least 1950. Hope that clears up your doubts. I’d be aware of expressing my opinions online if that’s the case. You don't have the people. You never had. Let me save you time. That's why your terrorist army goes around raping and killing Kashmiris indiscriminately. That's why you have to station half a million troops there to subjugate the population. Even a volatile state like Pakistan has adhered to international law more than India in this case. Fucking Pakistan yano. That's how low the bar is. India is so insecure over Kashmir, not only have they repeatedly violated international law, they've also burnt all bridges and destroyed all the legitimacy they had, if they had any. That's how insecure they are. And ultimately that insecurity is what will lead to Kashmir getting freedom from this country of jingoistic fucks. No. US, too, had a Civil War when the question came towards its sovereignty. The moment you question my nation's sovereignty and if you are an indian, you are a traitor. You mean what the Indian army did and is still doing there? Well, Kashmir is strategically important for the security of our nation acting as a buffer zone between radical Islamic terrorist country and communist china. so even though I’m atheist, I support complete crackdown on Islamic terror sympathisers both outside and inside India. Roy is an idiot and so are Kashmiri Seperatists. But: Seperatist SPEECH! is not illegal in the US. In the united states you can openly spread misinformation, openly be racist and burn the flag. Hell, they have palestine supporters openly spewing ISIS tier slogans across US cities right now. The US protects idiotic and harmful speech. If I go by your logic, the majority of Indians don't want another partition and are happy with India. So, no separatism should be tolerated. If India started following what every Tom dick and Harry then we are done for. Like South Africa dismantled their nuclear weapons, should we do that as well? I'm glad people like you are not at the helm of this great nation. \"muh 5 trillion pandits\" Basing your national policy on a shitty Marvel movie dialog. And people wonder why you lot are hated in mainstream india lol having the same religion does not stop the JKLF from wanting more land, nor does it stop Pakistan from wanting Kashmir. Such greed is human nature and no religion can prevent it. Treasonous speech is absolutely legal in the US. if you want to base your case on a 14th century monarchy, then the marathas should be claiming land up to Afghanistan. India has a billion+ people. Here, people can be riled up and cause riots that kill hundreds and hurt thousands on stupid fake news. In a nation like ours, free speech needs restrictions. And if you like US so much, why the fuck are you in r/India? US this, US that. Go worship US and Trump lol why should we have to split our nation into two? We did that once before and all it did was make a lifelong enemy who wants to destroy us. I point out the US because it has the most permissive laws around speech in the world and I believe these values should be spread around the world. By your logic its totally fine for islamic countries to ban Koran burning because that would also cause huge Instability, despite the fact that this is absolutely a violation of free expression. ROFL. When did you ever have to split your nation into two Uh uh, this isn't a whataboutery contest. Indian army has no doubt committed several crimes for which the perps would never be punished. However, that's on India. Had the Kashmiri terrorists attacked the armed forces and police and the state mechanism at every turn, it would be a legitimate rebellion. Instead, they chose to murder and harass civilians. That's on them. You can't win against a state this size, unless another state barges in. Pakistan tried, and all it achieved was unleash Islamism all over the subcontinent, and getting Kashmiri civilians killed. China isn't interested in destroying India either. It is bro. How many people do you want to be killed just so you can live in your glass tower and pretend to be like your waifu US?! Have you even ridden a city bus or been to a slum?! Pakistan is an integral part of India. Oh no! Anyway, in other news... The Kashmiri resistance has attacked only the Indian army and its collaborators. The ones who routinely target civilians are your rapist army, no one else. The reports and stats are out there for everyone to see. Pakistani funded militias have also attacked civilians and pandits, but they haven't had an iota of grassroots support. Anyways, all that in no way changes the fact that the Indian army rapes brides and pre pubescent girls there, detains youth for no reason and produces widows on the daily. They're the oppressors, and a third world country like Pakistan kicking a storm every now and then isn't really gonna change that. So you can stop using them as a punching bag. average mulla That's all you can respond with. Now go fap to the Ijraeli women on your phone. Lmao, sure. Kashmiri resistance my ass. The secular ones with a peacable solution are impotent, currently it's full of Islamists. Local support? The murderers of Pandits and other civilians are from the Kashmiri Muslim populace, so there is support for this shit. Indian Army's crimes are going to go unpunished, you are aware of that, I hope? Sad reality. So either the Kashmiris submit and suck up to the state, or they keep fighting for a \"freedom\" that they'll never achieve. So those murders were okay I guess? >Although the JKLF has only Muslim members Four of its Muslim leaders were part of the Islamist coalition 1971. It's top leaders shifted to hizbul when JKLF was weak showing that they were Islamists. Many JKLF leaders have argued for an attack on hindus and JKLF members were responsible for killing of many KPs. And why do you think these guys are protesting? Stop copying Wikipedia links. There is a reason for that they consider india as a Hindu country. What were the atrocities commited before they asked for independence. Were they denied dignity? The plebiscite front was formed by people who would soon be responsible for burning a Congress office and in 1965 they were the ones who were responsible for rioting. Their leaders are known Islamists including the cleric of Kashmir's most important mosque where there is apparently momo's hair. Wrong Is Kashmir an 'internal issue' of India or an International problem? It was India itself which took Kashmir issue to UN under Chapter VI of UN Charter, which deals with resolution of international disputes. So, India from that point implicitly affirmed that Kashmir is an international dispute. UNSC resolutions have no expiry date and remain binding on its members. So attempts to bilateralize Kashmir dispute, or make Kashmir an internal issue of India has no legs to stand on. This point is further explicitly corroborated by a long list of assurances made himself by the first Indian Prime Minister JawaharLal Nehru. Just quoting one relevant statement made J.L. Nehru on the floor of Indian Parliament in 1952 “It is an international problem. It would be an international problem anyhow if it concerned any other nation besides India and it does. It became further an international problem because a large number of other countries also took interest and gave advice…. We do not want to win people against their will and with the help of armed force, and if the people of Jammu and Kashmir State so wish it, to part company from us, they can go their way and we shall go our way. We want no forced marriages, no forced unions….\" —Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in Parliament on August 7, 1952. **Why has India denied Plebiscite?** Instead of trying to flesh out possible intentions, it's better to learn the truth from the horse's mouth. When V.K. Menon, India's Minister for Defense and second most powerful man after Nehru, was asked why India refused plebiscite; he candidly declared: \"Because we would lose it. Kashmir would vote to join Pakistan and no Indian Government responsible to agreeing to the plebiscite could survive.\" Further more, he conceded that \"There may be neither legal or moral justification for India's position on Kashmir, but the question was not what was right, but what was opportune.\" \\[Citation\\]: Arthur Tourtellot . \"Dilemma of a People Adrift. \" Saturday Review. March 6, 1965. p. 18 Who hurt u little boy ? U stupid fuck >The secular ones with a peacable solution are impotent, currently it's full of Islamists. The Kashmiri people have decided to put up with them out of necessity cause they're the only ones actively resisting and haven't put down their weapons unlike the secular ones. >Indian Army's crimes are going to go unpunished, you are aware of that, I hope? Karma is a thing. You never know what's in store for serial killers and rapists. >So either the Kashmiris submit and suck up to the state, or they keep fighting for a \"freedom\" that they'll never achieve. There is always light at the end of the tunnel. The road that the BJP is taking India down, it's only a matter of time till their bullshit becomes the problem of other communities and not just muslims and the country implodes into civil war. Look up the Algerian War of Independence. France also regarded them as an integral part, but in the end they gained their independence. It's only a matter of Kashmiri will. If it doesn't happen now, it'll happen a decade later. Or a decade after that. The BJP's settler colonial project WILL fail Never said that. I suggest removing the cow dung from your brain and learning some comprehension skills my g. Han headline se aage padhne ka dimag nahi hota WhatsApp graduates mae usually Exactly, that's like comparing India's GDP with basket case economies like Pakistan. Who Does that? Wait. 10 Saal , Angrezi mae bolo toh Desh ka GDP grow kar raha hae. you said \"your nation\" we do whatever the fuck we want with OUR nation. so suck it up. btw, which is your nation? Proof?

But don't worry, I'll be outta this shithole soon Unfortunately, the same one as yours. But don't worry, I'll be outta this shithole soon. Women of India are considered devis and goddesses. Anyone who abuses, rapes, marital rapes, women should be neutralized and considered an enemy of Bharat & Hindus. So let's garland them. Chai from between Modi's thai They're not putting up with them, they've transformed into them due to their frustration and rage. Sadly, no such thing as karma. Turks roam proud despite butchering Armenians. Gujarat pogrom commanders roam free, train carriage burners remain unknown. It's far easier for Indians to hold on to Kashmir because Indian lives are cheap compared to national pride. Can't compare with France. Yes, let's compare roads and new trains with US, UK and then when it comes to bad things, let's compare ourselves with South Sudan, Congo WAHH CHOMUJI WAHH Clearly if you're papa ki pari. You don't need job. Anyone who reads history knows she is right. Kashmir was not part of British India. Everything before that is Medieval shit. Do I want to dig that deep? Ask yourself this: if I said your comment above is terrorism, and had you arrested, would you be taking the same attitude? The issue isn't whether you agree with Roy and OP on the issue of Kashmir or not. The issue is whether India allows it's people to enjoy basic constitutional rights and protections or whether it's a country where you can only speak if what you say is popular with the powers that be. Because if it's the latter, then remember the day might not be far where you yourself might offend the supreme leader and his followers. And there might not be anyone left by then to defend your rights. Have the people on the \"other side\" arrested you for your opinions? Except they can't in India. In India you can only speak if it's popular. And you'd best hope that what you say today won't become unpopular ten years from now. If it does... Off to jail you go terrorist. Yes bro, go there, join the army and defend the integral part, Papa ki pari banke keyboard pe hero mat ban. I'm serving the nation in another way. Helping govt develop better tools to catch enemies and traitors like you. You're not going to get through here I think OP. One of the things I've had to accept is that India is a fundamentally illiberal and parochial society. Even the ones on the Internet and in seemingly liberal spaces such as this subreddit don't need much before their lack of liberality shines through. The fact is the vast majority of indians are totally fine with their rights being trampled, basic constitutional provisions ignored, their systems of governance being reduced by corruption and malicious incompetent. Especially when that system works against someone that they dislike. Their principles of liberalism only emerge if it's an opinion or position that is important to them. Or they are in some way impacted or proximate to the impact and can see it happening to them. Even the most anti-modi types are happy to throw out basic principles of freedom and constitutionality just as happily as the lot they profess to dislike. >I think calling for national integrity makes me Hindu nationalist now. Kinda does if you advocate for it at the cost of basic constitutional rights. Which is what Hindu nationalists do. If you're going to quack like a duck, it's not shocking someone will mistake you for one. Even if you aren't garbed in feathers. Ho please. We were colonized by a company, not even a country lmao. In the end, there were only a few thousand british soldiers in the entire subcon. Idk what national pride you're talking about. Y'all have stationed literally half a million troops in a tiny valley cause of how fucking insecure you are. Pakistan has invaded 3 times despite being 10 times weaker. They're in the trenches currently, yet India has no balls to enter GB and what's called 'Azad Kashmir'. You wanna know why? Cause they're fucking insecure. They know they have no legitimacy among the Kashmiri people, that's why they even arrest their own puppets. Shiekh Abdullah was Nehru's bitch yet even he didn't get spared. So far the majority of the cost in blood has been paid by the Kashmiri Muslims, and we know that India doesn't give a flying fuck about them. But the moment it starts affecting the population of India proper and poses a threat to its sovereignty, they'll scoot in no time. Then what was British India? The imperial government sent residents to the states which answered to the Viceroy. They were part of British India - as evidenced by how the constitutional reforms gave a third chamber in the Imperial Council for states. Yeah, that's where you're horribly mistaken; India is more than willing to sacrifice as many Indians as it takes to retain Kashmir. As for PoK and GB, you do realize that India has never initiated an invasion for that bit of territory? GB practically mutinied in favour of Pakistan, not so the rest of Kashmir. No worries, best wishes. Read your history well. (Apologies for hijacking the top comment) The 'Kashmir' you arrogantly mention is just a fraction of Jammu and Kashmir. Kashmir Valley is not even the entirety of Kashmir, and even in the valley it's merely 3 districts of South Kashmir that are a hotspot teeming with hyperactive militant separatists fueled by radical Islam and extremism. Individuals like Roy are nothing but promoters of their toxic extremism, backed by Pakistan and China, operating through POK, utterly disregarding the rest of the state's population. Your blind support not only disregards but also alienates crucial regions and people of Jammu, that has both Hindu and a large Muslim communities, and the tribal populations in the hilly areas of Jammu and Kashmir, the pahadi people that are ethnically different from Kashmiri muslims of the valley. This narrative shift, deliberately orchestrated by figures like Roy, aims only to create instability in our strategic state. Oh and Let's not forget that 'POK is' mostly occupied areas from the Jammu and Poonch regions and and a small part of kashmir region. ( where Poonch is the erstwhile poonch jagir autonomous from both Jammu and Kashmir regions and has both Hindu and Muslim communities ) This is a shameless regurgitation of the British tactic: just as they sidelined Indian Muslims in Congress and other groups, they strategically spotlighted the hyper-vocal, militant Muslim League, UNJUSTLY turning them into ambassadors for all Indian Muslims. Similarly, the militant separatist minority is being erroneously presented as representatives for all people of J and K. So before spouting off, refrain from commenting on matters you're utterly clueless about. People like Arudati Roy, Teesta Setalwad, Barkha Dutt are assets of US and Pakistan. They are puppets of geopolitics. >India is more than willing to sacrifice as many Indians as it takes to retain Kashmir. They haven't sacrificed shit. All they've been up against is rag tag guerrillas and children armed with pebbles. >As for PoK and GB, you do realize that India has never initiated an invasion for that bit of territory? I know that, that's what i said in my previous comment. They do claim that territory tho, but still haven't tried to get it back. I wonder why that is. The 'Kashmir' you arrogantly mention is just a fraction of Jammu and Kashmir.

Similarly, the militant separatist minority is being erroneously presented as representatives for all people of J and K. So before spouting off, refrain from commenting on matters you're utterly clueless about. Oh, you fail to understand it. European colonizers left because they feared French bodies returning in bags more than the benefit of retaining Algeria or Vietnam. They instead chose to bribe the former for retaining oil rights and the like. With regard to India, there's no shortage of poor men willing to serve in uniform in exchange for benefits and some social mobility. These guys die, it's okay for national pride. I.e., Europeans value their own people's lives more than any 3rd world country values its citizens. As for PoK and GB, while the official stance is simple, India has been quite willing to accept the LoC as the official border, if and only if hostilities from Pak end. India won't give up what it has, but isn't going to waste time for what it doesn't. I don’t live in India but I still consider it to be my motherland. I live in Belgium, fortunately a bit far from so called eu capital Brussels. You can’t imagine what a shithole of a place you dream of coming to. there are literal NO GO ZONES here even for police. you should consider lucky living in a place like India. Kashmir will always be the litmus test for Indian liberals and it shows here. This is not what I covered or meant. For normal person where money is required for sustainance, there are options - but those options do not always fall in comfort zone. Risk and rewards, along with uncertainty has to be embraced. Nothing is granted. Absolutely, i’m with you brother. Women shouldn’t be subjected to rape, abuses and also shouldn’t glorify the teachings of a child rapist(Aisha), incest among siblings, subjugation of women, forcing them to cover themselves from head to toe. women should be free of religious persecution, banning triple talaq was a good way forward though. >With regard to India, there's no shortage of poor men willing to serve in uniform in exchange for benefits and some social mobility. These guys die, it's okay for national pride. The moment Israelis are attacked even a little bit, they run to the nearest airport with their dual passports. Why? Because no sane person is willing to sacrifice their blood for a land that isn't even theirs. That explains the excessive use of JDAMS instead of ground troops. Same with America in Afghanistan. Similarly, that's the case with India and Kashmir. Your argument of 'national pride' makes no sense and doesn't apply to India. India is occupying Kashmir. Not the other way around. It's the Kashmiris who have served for their land and will continue to do so. Even random Pakistanis have more passion for Kashmir lmao. >they feared French bodies returning in bags more than the benefit of retaining Algeria or Vietnam. Exactly. That's the problem that India will eventually have. >Europeans value their own people's lives more than any 3rd world country values its citizens. I mean, as fascist as India is, I still think they'd probably prioritise their citizens and economy over a tiny valley. >India has been quite willing to accept the LoC as the official border, if and only if hostilities from Pak end. India won't give up what it has, but isn't going to waste time for what it doesn't. I mean they keep hollering for Akhand Bharat so I'm pretty confused as to what their stance is. My friend, read his full speech on his resignation and also read Pakistan or the partition of India. His stance is quite clear. I'm a Muslim. The establishment here wants to kill me and my kind. I think I'll take living in a legally dodgy eu state over the fear of getting lynched by a mob and having my women raped. Why EU countries which are Christian? Why not Muslim majority countries like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen. There are so many Muslim majority countries for you. It's her right as an Indian to state her opinion. It's your right as an Indian to disagree. It is NOT the right of the government to throw her in jail for that. How hard is that for you to understand? Having disagreeing opinions is healthy for a democracy. sovereignty and integrity of my nation is non negotiable. whatever your views are just put them way up your ass. You've completely missed the point. It's her right as an Indian to state her opinion. It's your right as an Indian to disagree. It is NOT the right of the government to throw her in jail for that. How hard is that for you to understand? Having disagreeing opinions is healthy for a democracy. You've completely missed the point. This is not a matter regarding kashmir, but of free speech. It's her right as an Indian to state her opinion. It's your right as an Indian to disagree. It is NOT the right of the government to throw her in jail for that. How hard is that for you to understand? Having disagreeing opinions is healthy for a democracy. >Why EU countries which are Christian? You mentioned Belgium so that's the example I took. >Why not Muslim majority countries like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen. Yeah, I don't really mind tbh. The economies are shit but at least I can live a decent life without the fear of a half dressed, saffron mob out to kill me. You've completely missed the point. This is not a matter regarding kashmir, but of free speech. It's her right as an Indian to state her opinion. It's your right as an Indian to disagree. It is NOT the right of the government to throw her in jail for that. How hard is that for you to understand? Having disagreeing opinions is healthy for a democracy. EXACTLY So I'm not even allowed to have an opinion on state's determinism or I get thrown in jail? What shit is this. This is a free republic, fuck off. Go to Afghanistan if you want this totalitarian style regime. Freedom of speech and freedom of thought is integral to a healthy democracy, something you clearly do not give a shit about. You're so wrong. You can write an article in the US discussing the merits of a state separating and suffer no consequences. That's what FREE SPEECH means. It's not just writing thing the state agrees with but what it disagrees with. People like you show that India is not mature enough to be a democracy. Good luck, if you think you have a better shot in above mentioned countries than India. deep down you know, I know and every Muslim in this country knows how diverse and tolerant our country is. But if Hindus have persecuted you personally so much then you’d be better off. Have a great journey. >I think calling for national integrity makes me Our national integrity is so fragile that one person's opinion breaks it ? So I'm not even allowed to have an opinion on state's determinism or I get thrown in jail? What shit is this. This is a free republic, fuck off. Go to Afghanistan if you want this totalitarian style regime. Freedom of speech and freedom of thought is integral to a healthy democracy, something you clearly do not give a shit about. He resigned in 1951. My excerpt is from the 1953 Aurangabad press conference. People change. If he were alive today, given the historical context, he would side with India. She still has the right to free speech, something you should be defending if you were actually a patriotic Indian. >In India you can only speak if it's popular. No, only if it resonates withe the govt, whichever govt it is ! Putting people in jail for simply supporting separatism is insane. You clearly do not consider personal liberty to be a sacred value to be upheld in any free society. India would have lost plebiscite, probably. But general will of people could have been different. Tribals (and some militants) of Pakistan migrated to kashmir illegally, which concerned hari sign which is why he signed instrument of accession. India's demand was first removal of invaders to have much fair plebiscite.. which maybe could've resulted in favour of india. (Idk of plebiscite could be done to have independent state). >The non Hindu fraction in India grew since 47 Not just non-Hindu, population of all religions grew since forever ! It is not. It never was. What you spew are silly ideals that are impractical in real life. Also, you have freedom of speech but not freedom of its consequences. Like I said, you can question the government. But the only thing you can not question is its existence (I.e. without consequences) No one is stopping you from spewing anti india and separatism rhetoric. But don't cry when you get arrested for it. When it comes to the safety and lives of billion + people, anyone who stands against the idea of India is an enemy, and any Indian who wishes to question Indias sovereignty is nothing but a traitor. Incorrect and not just incorrect, dangerously misinformed as well. The constitution of India explicitly puts restrictions on freedom of speech when it's a matter of security and sovereignty of India and relating to public order. So 1.) The action is constitutionally justified. 2.) charges under Sections 153A, 153B, and 505 becomes justified as she clearly shows support for, and promotes separatist groups that are responsible for brutal deaths of so many people in my state. 3.) That woman has time and again used the same old British tactic of unjustly endorsing an extremist militant community responsible for deaths of thousands as a representative of the entire section of a population and in doing so has strengthened and amplified internationally the voice of separatists who use islamic extremism to justify their violent and brutal acts. That is unforgivable. It is not. It never was. What you spew are silly ideals that are impractical in real life. Also, you have freedom of speech but not freedom of its consequences. Like I said, you can question the government. But the only thing you can not question is its existence (I.e. without consequences) No one is stopping you from spewing anti india and separatism rhetoric. But don't cry when you get arrested for it. When it comes to the safety and lives of billion + people, anyone who stands against the idea of India is an enemy, and any Indian who wishes to question Indias sovereignty is nothing but a traitor. Free speech doesn't give you to the right to say whatever the fuck you want. There are restrictions and consequences to it. Agree with having different opinions though. >you can question the government. But the only thing you can not question is its existence (I.e. without consequences) so essentially a blasphemy law. got it. US, which has a history of collapsing democratic regimes. US that supported the bengalli genocide and which called you lot dogs. US, which operates the world's best spying agency and still spys legally on its people. US which is still atm supporting an apartheid regime that is bombing kids just to maintain its hegemony on brown people. What a beacon lol. Idiots like you make me cringe whenever ABCDs speak. And if you're not of Indian origin, then fuck off. So he was a traitor before 1953 acc. to you? What's your evidence for his stance changing? Man was a strong believer in self-determination. Read PaPoI How many Israelis actually fled, honestly? Unlike Kashmir for most Indians, Israel is their homeland. India will not have the problems you mention because India is never going to develop to that level. Human rights are a luxury for and of wealthy nations. Again, big mistake here; Akhand Bharat is a slogan by the rabble. Indian deep state doesn't want any reunification, and they're the ones driving policy. you high on something? What do you think will happen if India retreats from Kashmir? You think it will still be secular? It is BECAUSE India is there that it is a place worth living currently. > It's her right as an Indian to state her opinion. It's your right as an Indian to disagree. Opinion. Really. Opinion that integral part of India is not ours. I'm saying he changed his thoughts. His previous thoughts were akin to him being a traitor. Misinformed ideals are a bane to any civilization. > Visit the countries who donot have and try speaking against that country in front of any govt building and you will get to know. Are those countries democracies ? And with a Constitution that promises free speech ? Absolute deflection. Why are you against India become a truly free country? We are seven comments in and you have given zero evidence to back this up. Id rather argue with critfin at this point. How is questioning the survival of the entity that protects and nurtures you blasphemy. That's like opposing treatment of a doctor while in the icu. Besides anyone who wishes to create an independent kashmir is directly advocating for blasphemy law as it will either fall into Pakistan (which already has one), be under China or if by some miracle did survive while being in between 3 nuclear nations, would be a Islamic hellhole like Afghanistan. Which begs the question, why don't you go talk to Pakis why they won't free their side of Kashmir ? Anyone who wishes harm on my people is an enemy and a terrorist. And there is only one punishment suitable for them. So I'm not even allowed to have an opinion on state's determinism? or I get thrown in jail? >Sorry for the misunderstanding, I said “neutralised” which was a polite way of saying “killed like a rabid dog in street” What shit is this. This is a free republic, fuck off. Go to Afghanistan if you want this totalitarian style regime. Freedom of speech and freedom of thought is integral to a healthy democracy, something you clearly do not give a shit about. > opposition and criticism are a vital signs of healthy democracy and we respect your criticism on state’s policies and decisions, but as I said freedom of speech go as far as it’s not violating the sovereignty of our country. That’s the line no one should cross. No country will tolerate that and we certainly don’t. India is taking extreme steps who cross that line ex: Nijjar killing. Btw, I’m not even a bjp supporter. I like having a strong opposition but a majority, solid government which puts India first police and decisiveness is good for country. I searched a lot for any source for your claim of about assaulting domeatic help but couldn't find any.Please provide some source or edit this. I gave you the article dumbass. Even the article you shared corroborated my dates. Why don't you give me proof for your point ? Or are you just twisting the conversation to justify your misinformation. India is a free country. Why are you against its existence? In the US, in UK you can write an article openly discussing state separation. Scotland is actively considering leaving the uk. This was only possible because of free speech. Anything that India does and contains can be discussed, questioned and challenged. India is a manmade entity, not something created by God. Let Indians openly discuss what is \"good for the country\" instead of blindly following what you or the ruling govt thinks is best. That is how a mature democracy functions and survives. Through conversation, not coercion. How the fuck am I against its existence? Just because I support freedom of expression even for stupid or harmful Ideas does not mean I support the ideas themselves. Bro it doesn't matter. The power of freedom of speech is not only to state opinions govt agrees with by dissenting ones as well. That is how healthy mature democracy functions, that is how life is in US, UK, Canada, France etc. You can say things like Scotland or Quebec should declare independence, you can say things like Trump should be impeached, you can say supreme court has lost legitimacy. Has she actually voiced explicit support for harming anyone? No. She is expressing some idiotic opinions, and you ought to disagree with her. Jailing her for speech is absolutely insane. In UK you can write an article saying Scotland should declare independence. In France you can openly state you think Macron should be deposed. In Canada you can demand Quebecois freedom. That's how freedom of speech works. You can say things not just that the state agrees with, but disagrees with as well. It is sad how so many Indians do not fight for your rights as an Indian while rabidly defending the country. If you were truly a patriotic Indian you would be enraged at some government official trampling your rights as an Indian, even if you disagree with that Indian. What she said does not come under that extremities. It is something said in civil discussion, she is not directly inciting terrorism. Because last time such ideas were entertained you got the biggest mass migration in human history, millions of dead, lakhs of rapes, generations worth of trauma and two nuclear armed nations that fought 4 wars, one genocide with 3 million dead and regular skirmishes that kill dozens every year. And you love US and its ideals so much. Go. Go over there and preach bomb making under the guise of free speech. You will be anal raped by a taser and water boarded in Gitmo before you can scream \"1st Amendment\". Just like your fellow \"separatists\". Idiot. You got all of that from one sentence she said? > The power of freedom of speech is not only to state opinions govt agrees with by dissenting ones as well. Hmm. She should be locked behind in the sedition laws in my opinion. You got nothing from multiple paragraphs? Smh India is not an unchanging monolith created by God. It is man made. And all things made man can be questioned, changed and improved. Simply discussing state sovereignty in civil discussion does not call for arrest. It keeps our democracy and our nation healthy. It allows for evolution and new ideas. That to me is far more important in the long run than the coercion of people. Man, honestly, save your breath. You ain't gonna change opinions online, especially not by debating with jackasses. Because last time such ideas were entertained you got the biggest mass migration in human history, millions of dead, lakhs of rapes, generations worth of trauma, dozens of pogroms, ethnic cleaning of entire cities and two nuclear armed nations that fought 4 wars, one ethno religious genocide with 3 million dead and regular skirmishes that kill dozens every year. And you love the UK and its ideals so much. Go. Go over there and preach bomb making under the guise of free speech. You will be anal raped by a taser and water boarded in an offshore prison before you can scream \"freedom of speech\" . Just like your fellow \"separatists.\" Idiot. Because last time such ideas were entertained you got the biggest mass migration in human history, millions of dead, lakhs of rapes, generations worth of trauma, dozens of pogroms, ethnic cleaning of entire cities and two nuclear armed nations that fought 4 wars, one ethno religious genocide with 3 million dead and regular skirmishes that kill dozens every year. Idiot. Because last time such ideas were entertained you got the biggest mass migration in human history, millions of dead, lakhs of rapes, generations worth of trauma, dozens of pogroms, ethnic cleaning of entire cities and two nuclear armed nations that fought 4 wars, one ethno religious genocide with 3 million dead and regular skirmishes that kill dozens every year. Idiot. But she can incite violence with whatever she said. She is a known and prominent figure and clearly knows that her words can influence people. Saying that Kashmir isn't a part of India will incite violence whether said in a civil discussion or not In US, Texas did not commit terrorist acts against US and killed 1000’s of civilians and soldiers to make their point. Scotland is not taking up arms against UK or pelting stones on soldiers, bombing army convoy to make their point. I don’t even believe in god. But I care about our national security considering Kashmir and Ladakh as strategically important locations to have a peaceful existence for us Indians. I don’t give a flying fuck what our ruling government thinks, we would even revolt against incumbent government if they compromised the security of our nation. I disagree with bjp on so many levels but their importance to national security and India first policy is what bought them back to power and will again bring them back to power. Modi government is constitutionally elected by the people of India to let us have freedom and peaceful existence and they are doing their job well. Let’s have a conversation even with Pakistan and Kashmir separatists when they stop terrorising our country and lay their arms down. I could go stand in the middle of new York city waving an al-Qaeda flag holding a poster celebrating 9/11 and I still wouldn't be arrested. And how the fuck am I a separatist buddy? Kashmir should never be allowed to seperate under any circumstance. No referendum should be held, actual terrorists should be killed. You are aware thar free speech rights in countries like the US, Germany and Canada still do have restrictions. For example a German can have the opinion that the Nazi's were good actually. But they will be thrown in jail for that. Shocking 😲. Why do so many people hold the global south to a standard that developed countries themselves don't adhere to? Do it and prove me wrong. You and I both know the consequences of that action. You are the one supporting the idea that separatist ideas should not be prosecuted. How am I supposed to believe you even care about Indians. Level of development of that people is different from ones here. What her statements only will help in adding oil to fire. I also disagree with laws against hate speech on the same principle, I don't think anyone should be arrested for stoking racial or religious hatred. That does not mean I support racial/religious hatred. Anyway have a good day. Feeling kashmir should be part of India is jackess. I wonder how many criminals are still saying things in the name of liberalism. Nope. I am talking about the fraction of religion in the total. Not total population.( Of course total population grew world wide, the percentage varied) Not fragile. But an example should be made by taking action. Otherwise people can talk about anything and get away. I think I have answered it multiple times in these threads. Exactly. Civilized countries listen to criticisms they hate/think are vile I love how you are so confidently incorrect. She, in fact, does not have any such rights as an Indian. Oh no healthy democracy of USA , I'm , canada and France which bans the slogan from river to the sea . Great news... We should make an example out of her . The constitution restricts freedom of speech in matters of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. It's not just \"what's popular\". And the above comment isn't terrorism as it's backed by the government of a real country that is internationally recognised. At best it can be called a territorial dispute. Even Russia attacking Ukraine can't be called terrorism. Only the Wagner groups actions can be called terrorism as they are a private org. >Level of development of that people is different from ones here. Yeah and we're not going to become developed by acting like authoritarian twats. >The constitution restricts freedom of speech in matters of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. It's not just \"what's popular\". If saying something unpopular gets you accused of terrorism, then that is exactly what it is. The restriction the constitution places on this speech is allowing the government to make *reasonable* restrictions. Calling someone a terrorist just because their opinion offends you isn't reasonable except in an undemocratic authoritarian shithole. >And the above comment isn't terrorism as it's backed by the government of a real country that is internationally recognised. At best it can be called a territorial dispute. Even Russia attacking Ukraine can't be called terrorism. Only the Wagner groups actions can be called terrorism as they are a private org. First off, the Wagner group is formally backed by the Russian state. Second, literally no part of this paragraph is relevant to the discussion at hand. Its also largely wrong in terms of how terrorism is defined and commonly understood, but I'm not going to get into that discussion given that its completely meaningless here. Kashmir legally joined India when Raja Hari Singh the documents with Sardar Patel. Roy is out of her mind. Yes you are absolutely correct. You are not allowed to have an opinion on state's determinism. This is 'sovereign, democratic, republic' . Sovereign as in anyone who attacks it will get dealt with . Democratic as in more number of votes will decide who rules , republic just means not a monarchy. She is lucky she isn't getting hanged for shit she pulls . Separatists not allowed here. Go fuck off somewhere else. I could make the case that your comment incites violence because people might find it offensive. Is it now ok to jail you for terrorism? Seize your property? Bar you from exercising ordinary rights? Better yet. Someone *ten years from now* could decide this comment was terrorism. Would you call that reasonable? Or would you be shrieking then about how unfair and evil it is? Bangladesh is also an integral part of India. Pack bags and fuck off to us. Separatist need bullet in head nothing else. It is in this country. You do realize that under the logic you're defending, your own comment could constitute terrorism and you could be arrested for it? East Pakistan. Obviously. Of course it says Hyderabad. We saw news of how pro Pakistan Hyderabad was just recently. It shouldn't be. Burning the quran is banned in every muslim majority country, thats wrong too. No basic constitutional right is above national integrity atleast in our constitution. All \"fundamental rights\" have provisions where they can be suspended. Kashmir had autonomy and a Prime minister as the head of the state until the 60s. She and other USA puppets need bullet in the head. Cia puppet pannun , David headly and their Ilk needs to be weeded out of India or simply offed wherever they are. Bullshit claims don't have sources. >Because last time such ideas were entertained you got the biggest mass migration in human history, millions of dead, lakhs of rapes, generations worth of trauma, dozens of pogroms, ethnic cleaning of entire cities and two nuclear armed nations that fought 4 wars, one ethno religious genocide with 3 million dead and regular skirmishes that kill dozens every year. The last time such \"ideas\" were entertained in India, it led to the country challenging the political status quo and achieving its independence. It led to the likes of Ambedkar advocating for the rights of the oppressed within Indian society, shining a light on the banal evils of casteism. It led to communities articulating their rights for tribal, linguistic, religious and cultural autonomy. India's applying the same logic to Roy and other dissenters today as the government did to the likes of Gandhi, Nehru and Savarkar in the early 20th century. Who knows? You saying they should only be punished after its broken? That's like saying there should be no punishment for attempt to murder as the murder didn't actually take place. Right to free speech is an illusion even under the mighty American democracy. Just look at Julian Assange or that next guy Snowden who are being witchhunted for corroborating their free speech with facts. I for one am waiting for us to get full on I'd connected to online account. Traitors like you should be rotting in jail not getting job and having any investments in trade. Yes. In emergency situations. Not just because someone articulates a controversial position about what constitutes national integrity. If any statement that offends you can basically be called terrorism, or any controversial statement about the government or its policies can be considered an attack on \"national integrity\" then you don't have any constitutional rights whatsoever. You might as well ask why the framers of the constitution bothered articulating those rights at all. Or why they and other nationalists even bothered overthrowing the British Empire if the idea was to just replace it with an equally authoritarian regime. Atleast the empire gave people international mobility. > In a nation like ours, free speech needs restrictions. If a decade from now you're arrested for this post and called a terrorist, something tells me you'd have a *very* different attitude towards the issue. Fuck off from here .. if you aren't Indian don't comment on India's sovereignty. She should have been rotting in jail from day 1 and her ilk like David headly, pannun dead . Unfortunately we are very weak country , can't even deal with outright separatist. Better yet.. bend a hijabi for oily majhabi round. Man we really need I'd connected to social media accounts. Traitors like you should rot in jail , not get a job and then try to justify and maybe even fund other traitors She should read about Abhinav Gupt This ain't the US. You are free to go there. >Fuck off from here .. Funny this in a post about how offensive speech results in someone being accused of terrorism. Imagine if you got arrested for this. >if you aren't Indian don't comment on India's sovereignty. I am unfortunately. And its not India's sovereignty I'm commenting on. It is the fundamentally regressive, illiberal, parochial, bigoted attitude of Indians as a whole. Which this comment section is a shining example of. And you are too. >She should have been rotting in jail from day 1 For... offending you? Saying mean things? Articulating a vision of India you disagree with? If this was the 1930s, folks like you would be saying the exact same thing about Gandhi, Ambedkar and Savarkar. >and her ilk like David headly, pannun dead . Yeah. And its people like you that I'm identifying as inherently lacking in liberality and progressive ideals. And why India has begun regressing towards authoritarianism and a horrific decay of the basic principles of the rule of law. Its a system that would make the colonial Brits very proud. >Unfortunately we are very weak country , can't even deal with outright separatist. I certainly agree that we are a very weak country. So weak that we lash out like children at speech that makes us uncomfortable. So impotent and disempowered that rather than demand a system that protects fundamental human and constitutional rights, we just want to lock up anyone we disagree with. You may want to consider what happens though if ever someone in power gets offended by what you say and decides they think you're a terrorist. There might not be anyone left to advocate for you when that happens because they would have all been called terrorists and jailed and murdered as you demand. This is why bjp is must . Congress too weak infront of traitors and terrorists. Cry about it. Arundhati Roy and other usa / pak puppets deserve bullet in head . Like Listening to from river to sea there will be Palestine I will cry about it. Its sad to see India and Indians reduced to being authoritarian idiots. You may want to consider what would happen if someone decided *you* were a puppet of some power they had decided was \"anti-Indian\" and advocated the same for you. I imagine you wouldn't be so gung-ho then. But then the folks who might cry about it would have had bullets in their head... so atleast there won't be a lot of crying when the guns come for you :) Freedom of speech means we get to ban - from river to sea there will be Palestine . Freedom of speech means we get to ban - from river to sea there will be Palestine. Northern Ireland too No point arguing with dumb. You’re just wasting bandwidth and your time. Context is if you have freedom of speech you can say from river to sea there will be Palestine. Well these statements you just made would land you in jail once you get as famous as Ms Roy. It's not even the bjp, our constitution is the one that will be putting you there. >I am unfortunately Pack bags fast and get out of here. >Yeah. And its people like you Completely ignored David headly, pannun. Because either you have no idea who they are or you are just sympathetic to them . >. Its a system that would make the colonial Brits very proud It's people like you who like licking unwashed anus of white man and islamists , not me. >lock up Read again. I said bullet in the head not lock up. >someone in power gets offended Well unfortunately for you , and fortunately for india , people like me vote and decide who comes to power. She is a cia asset like pannun , David headly. This trash needs to be cleared. Either jail or bullet in head. Anything easy and quick is better. Pretty sure the case isnt about that. Case is about freedom of speech. Is jailing anyone who says it not violation of fos? >It continues to assert that a secular, independent Kashmir—free of both India and Pakistan—is its eventual goal. Lol what makes you think that's acceptable? It's exactly the same thing khalistanis want. But the woman he's defending in this post didn't. >Pack bags fast and get out of here. Haha, so cute. Such a strong democratic country. >Completely ignored David headly, pannun. Because either you have no idea who they are or you are just sympathetic to them . I ignored a strawman non-sequitor? Headley was convicted of actually engaging in *acts* that contributed towards terrorist attacks. Not for saying mean things to the people in power a decade ago or articulating a vision of government you dislike. The fact that you compare them highlights your dishonesty on this issue. Why not just compare Gandhi to Genghis Khan? Savarkar to Stalin? >It's people like you who like licking unwashed anus of white man and islamists , not me. Glad to get that off your chest? Do you feel all strong and manly now? Have you done your patriotic and nationalistic duty? But what happens if a decade from now the government is eagerly trying to build relations with said white man or Islamist, and decides your words are terrorism? But I assume you live in a world where bad things only happen to people you dislike right? The authoritarian system would never turn on you! >Read again. I said bullet in the head not lock up. My point stands. >Well unfortunately for you , and fortunately for india , people like me vote and decide who comes to power. I know? Which is exactly what I said above? Not sure its fortunate for India to regress into a violent, authoritarian, ultranationalist cesspit. But I'm well aware that the majority of Indians do not share my ideas about liberal, rights based, constitutional and rule of law government. People like you favor extralegal violence, bigotry, and terror as forms of government. Weird though that you accuse me of pandering to Islamists when as a form of government, theirs is what you aspire to. >Calling someone a terrorist just because their opinion offends you isn't reasonable except in an undemocratic authoritarian shithole. It's not offending me. Its just challenging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India and that's a criminal offence. >First off, the Wagner group is formally backed by the Russian state. Second, literally no part of this paragraph is relevant to the discussion at hand. Its also largely wrong in terms of how terrorism is defined and commonly understood, but I'm not going to get into that discussion given that its completely meaningless here. Ah yes I think I read somewhere that the Wagner group was formalised as a part of Russian military sone time ago. Sorry but I was talking about the time before that happened. And about how terrorism is understood, I already know I am right so please don't bother. Freedom of speech has limits. Until I know her whole lecture, I cannot judge one line from it. Your opinion has been received loud and clear. Unfortunately, the world doesn't revolve around your ideals. Ya, “unknown men” should operate in India too now. >It's not offending me. Its just challenging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India and that's a criminal offence. If India's sovereignty can get challenged merely because someone offers a critique of governmental policy, or a perspective on a historical process you disagree with, then it might as well not exist. Any statement can be turned around and construed as challenging the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India by that logic. And that's the point. It obviously does offend you, and the powers that be, if you believe it arises to a terroristic offense. Merely for saying a person believes Kashmir isn't, or shouldn't, be a part of India, or that generally India has mishandled the issue. Which is the point. You don't have any constitutional freedom of speech. Its been trampled on. This isn't someone's *actions* against the state being punished. Its basically criminalizing offensive words. Nope. You are just adding stuff onto it. No one's talking about policies of the government here. You just can't support seperatism. It's a very specific issue that you just can't support. “No one is stopping you from saying <something>. But don’t cry when you get arrested for it.” Can you read that again? This is what you are saying - “You don’t have to give me all your money. But don’t cry when you get killed for it” I don't believe you'd get thrown in jail for saying 'nazis we're good actually'. And more to the point, you definitely wouldn't get thrown in jail for saying that Bavaria isn't an integral part of Germany. Citizens of developed countries aren't so insecure I guess 😎 “No one is stopping you from saying <something>. But don’t cry when you get arrested for it.” Can you read that again? This is what you are saying - “You don’t have to give me all your money. But don’t cry when you get killed for it” Thats fine, this is only reddit and I just expressed my own opinion. Nobody is obligated to agree with me. You can construe anything as separatism or challenging the integrity of India. You seem to believe the government would restrain itself but there is no evidence whatsoever of this. Roy has done nothing to actually challenge Indian stability. She's simply offered a critique on a specific historical and geopolitical issue. To call it terrorism is to criminalize any speech the government can arbitrarily consider destabilizing. Is it news to you that India doesn't have absolute freedom of speech? It never did. If your statements can be construed to be against national integrity, then you are fucked. As simple as that. What do you think happened to sharjeel imam? (Or whatever was the name of the guy from jnu who wanted to cut off the \"chicken's neck\") This bitch needs to be thrown in jail Yes and the fact that pakistan would not allow you to say this in their country is wrong. There is evidence. The provision have always existed and we have been fine for 75 years. >Roy has done nothing to actually challenge Indian stability. I disagree and so do a lot of other people. Let the judges decide now. You are the clueless one. Try to justify it as much as you want. But Roy actually cares about Kashmiris and the rights of the people there. I don't agree with her on lots of things, but her activism doesn't get her fame, money or power - just the opposite. She is motivated by fighting injustice and giving voice to the downtrodden. Unlike most Indian patriots who would love for the pesky kashmiri population to leave India's integral border state It isn't news to me. I'm saying it's an indication of how India is rapidly sliding into authoritarianism and Indians are cheering as it happens. There's nothing violent about Roy's statement. There's certainly no actions that tie into violence. The fact that this is charged as terrorism, while openly calling for minorities and dissidents to be shot (as people in the government have) isn't is also indicative of the decline of the constitutional right and a collapse into arbitrary authoritarian diktat. This isn't a question of \"absolute\" free speech. It's about how we're quickly declining towards having none at all Lol this lady doesn't even have household help. What are you talking about It hasn't actually. The law she is being charged with is recent, and is the blatantly draconian and authoritarian UAPA which has been amended to essentially destroy basic constitutional protections fairly recently. This isn't a 75 year old law. The law she has been charged under was given the form it has in 2019. Supporting extremism and violent separatists in the name of supporting \" kashmir \" is not caring for anyone. I know simple logic is hard for you to follow but keep thinking about it maybe it'll click in a few months. Partition would never happened if India remained ruled by the British. The Brits should have been stricter and banned all writing and speech about independence. Indians would have been safer for it. Man I bet imagining the murder of strangers really gets your endorphins up. Does it put a big smile on your face after a day in the office and the traffic? Good on you friend, keep on building India with these violent reddit comments >Just because I support freedom of expression even for stupid or harmful Ideas does not mean I support the ideas themselves. And your ideal of supporting freedom of speech for stupid or harmful ideals is just as damaging to the Existence of India as a sovereign state as those people. Lol another leak of 80 crore aadhar IDs incoming. Please use this spare time to improve your basic IT skills, if you are behind some of the other govt IT tools I've had the displeasure of using. >I could go stand in the middle of New York City waving an al-Qaeda flag and holding a poster celebrating 9/11 and I still wouldn't be arrested. You would be if you try similar shit in India. Like celebrating 26/11. And the majority of the country and I would be fuckin delighted when you do get arrested. Is it really the safety and lives of 1 billion + people? Lakhs of people die every day due to poor road infrastructure, air pollution, adulterated food and unregulated natural medicine. No one really cares about those deaths. What happened to that govt minister's son who ran down all those farmers? Or were they traitors too? >Sovereign as in anyone who attacks it will get dealt with attacks with speech>gets arrested> 🫡 >By your logic its totally fine for islamic countries to ban Koran burning because that would also cause huge Instability, despite the fact that this is absolutely a violation of free expression. Life of humans come first in my ideals. So violating freedom of speech to save lives is pretty justified. > I believe these values should be spread around the world. I hope your believe never come true. Karma eventually gets you Try writing something about boycotting Israeli products, you will be charged with a federal offence. It's against the law to even state ' let's boycott Israeli companies'. The truckers of Canada got their bank accounts freezed for displaying nazi memorabilia. Spain files charges on Catalon supporters. The list can go on. These things happen in countries considered fully democratic. india and Israel are both flawed democracies. Praising hamas in their case and Kashmiri separatism in our case will land you in jail >Putting people in jail for simply supporting separatism is insane. Simply just putting people in jail for supporting extreme things such as separatism is pretty tame. The people who threaten the sovereignty of my country. Comment section proves the point. India is heading down a bad path which will end in some genocide or something. >its completely meaningless here. Not as meaningless as the strawman you've constructed by deliberately misrepresenting sedition and incitement as an attack on free speech. Apple, orange. France isn't really spreading propaganda claiming Bavaria should join them, are they? Or are Babarians blowing themselves up every other minute? Literally neither of those happened. Especially since it's literally been over 10 years since she gave that speech and was 9 years before the passage of the law she's being charged under. It's literally post hoc criminalization of speech. Kashmir is administered and governed by three countries: India, Pakistan, and China. The specific phrase \"integral\" is a term often used by the Indian government to assert its sovereignty over the region. The same term is also used by Pakistanis and China calls it a strategically important place. Not true its not an offense, its simply that state governments have made it illegal for publicly controlled projects and investments from involving any companies that support boycotts of Israeli companies. Its absolutely not illegal to simply vocally support a boycott. The truckers in Canada were charged for blocking roads for weeks. The point stands, india is not a true democracy. It never was. Going against the govt stand in terms of national security will only cause problems. Even writing against the prime minister or any politician in power can land you in a jail if the person who files a complaint against you has good relations with the police . In a supposed free state like the US, even that boycott stance should not have been made. If you engage in a hypothetical boycott against Indian companies, nothing will happen but if you do against Israel charges will be filed. Every state has its limits. sometimes I do feel like using phrases like, the world's a tough place just wear a helmet If OP is a free thinker and not a closed minded person he'll arrive it in some years after honestly asking himself that question. He/she will need some time. >waving an al-Qaeda flag holding a poster celebrating 9/11 and I still wouldn't be arrested. if u pulled this stunt between 2001-2004 it would have been your one way ticket to Guantanamo bay... Then why they are above in rank on that website for freedom of speech is my question? I'm surprised at how many Indians are all for censorship and punishment of speech by hiding under the guise of national sovereignty. Tge language you used shows your literacy and IQ level. You just don’t deserve a logical reply 🗿 Okay > The constitution restricts freedom of speech in matters of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. It's not just \"what's popular\". that's awfully convenient for the state because literally anything can be a matter of sovereignty. Trust me, we do not have freedom or democracy in india, we have the illusion of both. I think this is the full speech. Part 1 anyway though you should find part 2 linked in the same video. I understand the negative connotations associated with doing this. But Arundati Roy is definitely a .... special case of stupid. You are also wishing harm though It can be strategically important for a lot of reasons but how is it a buffer? There are still huge borders with Pakistan and China its bad for the economy for people to rot in jail instead of earning India is soon going to be the Hindu version of Iran or Saudi. Terrible strawman argument. You just compared robbery and murder to facing consequences for what you say. Freedom of speech ≠ Freedom from consequences. Never has been and never will be and this is the same everywhere. By that logic, you should also be allowed to go and scream death threats to random people and still be free. Just an FYI and just to give you a dose of reality, you can't just type all that and assume that people will forget millions killed when pakistan decided to seperate from india Nobody needs to forget it. Quite a few Muslims, who would go on to become citizens of Pakistan, were killed too because we succumbed to our basest and most violent instincts. Which isn't an excuse to turn around and undermine the very system that we put in place to protect against those very instincts. Indians struggled to achieve self government so that we could have a system which was just and equitable. Those survivors of partition, the founding fathers, and the hundreds of millions who fought for independence put in place a constitution so that the state would never again trample on our basic, fundamental rights. And not just the state, but others as well. So that even the most wretched person, the most left behind, the most hurt would be able to speak up. One of those rights was that of free speech. Yes it was with constraints, but fundamentally it was about allowing *all* of us to speak up. Even if that meant saying unpopular things. Disliked things. Provocative things. And we should all be aghast and upset by those principles being eroded by Indians and their government today, who seem to be interested in catering to anything more than their most bigoted, primal instincts. If you only have the right to speak to power when it's pleasant and acceptable to a majority of people and the powers that be, then you don't have the right to speak at all. Calling someone a terrorist, and seeking to prosecute them, over a speech more than a decade ago is simply the vindictive authoritarianism that Indians had fought *against* in seeking their independence and then the drafting of the constitution. What is happening today is denigrating and undermining the sacrifices and suffering of our predecessors from that era. You want me to have a dose of reality? Here is mine for you. This is happening precisely because people *have* forgotten the millions of deaths you're talking about. We're spitting on the ashes and graves of those who sacrificed their lives to overthrow tyranny by cheering for it now. Indians really have a massive problem understanding that land and people are not property or toys to be fought over. Kashmir, the north east, lower castes - all these are viewed as possessions by the privileged. They cannot understand why Kashmiris might not want to be part of India. Heck, do the four southern states want to be part of india? it is very sad that we have come full circle on what freedom got us. We are now the colonizers. >it is very sad that we have come full circle on what freedom got us. We are now the colonizers. Thing is, I don't actually agree with that. I think, as a general principle, India *has* been right on the Kashmir issue, especially considering the external violence and that it has continuously been a victim of asymmetric warfare. But the fact that I believe that doesn't mean its right to erode the freedoms of those I don't agree with. The fact that Roy disagrees, or that you do, should not invite an accusation of terrorism! The fact that even this subreddit is busily cheering what is an atrocious and gross undermining of basic constitutional rights is a really tragic thing. What is privileged here is all of these people who think the state or the mob would never turn these weapons against them. That they are somehow safe from the tyrannical violence they're happy to see inflicted on others. It has nothing to do with murder or any action in particular. If a citizen is arrested for doing A, nobody in their right mind would say, “I’m free to do A. It’s just that the govt. would arrest me. But I have the freedom to do A” That’s the stupidity I’m trying to point out here. People casually talking about \"neutralizing\" literal Indian citizens is fucking crazy. I know it's bad but jesus christ these andhbhakts have been sooo well-manipulated by the powers that be ki kisi ki JAAN lena is just casually thrown around. none of this is terrorism and i agree with you fully there. The indian state is just weaponizing its flimsy laws when convenient to silence criticism. Where i disagree is on Kashmir being part of india by default, just because people outside kashmir say so and want it to be so. Same with the north east - do the residents there want to be part of india? This boils down to a dick measuring contest and it is fundamentally stupid. What most commenters here do not realise is that given the choice between food and democracy, most would choose food, even if that food came via an authoritarian state. Wow you're really adding to the discourse, wouldn't be surprised if this account belonged to a kid lmao This women is defending Islamic nationalism you say? >Which isn't an excuse to turn around and undermine the very system that we put in place to protect against those very instincts. Indians struggled to achieve self government so that we could have a system which was just and equitable.

And not just the state, but others as well. So that even the most wretched person, the most left behind, the most hurt would be able to speak up. Which is ironic isn't? The people who did partition never thought about millions killed on both sides. Neither the british nor congress or jinnah thought of the implications of how many would be killed if partition was carried. They thought of having rights for future indians but not of the ones at that time. >One of those rights was that of free speech. Yes it was with constraints, but fundamentally it was about allowing all of us to speak up. Even if that meant saying unpopular things. Disliked things. Provocative things. >And we should all be aghast and upset by those principles being eroded by Indians and their government today, who seem to be interested in catering to nothing more than their most bigoted, primal instincts. Actually you will surprised to know that both congress and bjp are equally strict on seperatist movements (including trampling on free speech). I can link you history to prove that if you want. >What is happening today is denigrating and undermining the sacrifices and suffering of our predecessors from that era. You want me to have a dose of reality? Here is mine for you. This is happening precisely because people have forgotten the millions of deaths you're talking about. We're spitting on the ashes and graves of those who sacrificed their lives to overthrow tyranny by cheering for it now. Actually i have a different perspective here. I think we are not committing the same mistakes our founding fathers did which is ignoring the implications of millions getting killed because of partition. We know that we can't commit the same mistake again. Then it's 13 years too late. It's totally unacceptable to say something like that, and live like a free bird for 13 years without any consequences. Our rules need to be stricter and justice system needs to be faster. How can Kashmir be an integral part of India if little to no Kashmiris want to be part of fascist India. Do they have no agency? It’s analogous to the the idea that Taiwan is an integral part of China despite little support for reunification with China, still the Chinese can claim to have some case for at least 10% support unification according to polls, yet in Kashmir you’re lucky to get 5% support for India. Thank You. Also, why are you on Reddit at 3.30 AM ? Go to sleep bud. Reddit aint worth it. Doubt it. Theyd put me on a list sure, but it takes more than that to get sent to gitmo. Roy is a disgrace to all of India! Another leeli gang post 😂 > India ranks 161 out of 180 in press freedom index LMAO, isn't it the same press freedom where Pakistan and Afghanistan ranks above India? What a joke. Anybody who threatens the sovereignty of India should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law >Indian liberals oxymoron. liberalism is only possible in western countries and we can see how its ruining them. India needs strongmen in power to maintain stability. Yep. She had a very positive relationship with Yasin Malik. 1947 me kashmir signed the instrument of accession. Mind you , the conditions to join India or the content of the contract was the same as with all other princely states.Not Just kashmir, other princely were also diplomatically broken down to accept the accession. Kashmir by this definition is no different than the 552 other princely states. If kashmir is not an integral part of India then , by logic bikaner , Hyderabad, Bhopal should be an integral part by virtue of their reluctance to accept the indian state. We can talk about the human rights violation and soon and so forth but giving secessionist rhetoric is where we should draw a line. By the constitution itself, no indian territory has the right of secession. Well you can fearmonger all you want. It's pretty obvious even to a layman that saying \"Kashmir is not an integral part of India\" is a big no no and should have consequences. She has the rights to free speech here in India. But right to free speech, doesn't mean you're free from the consequences of your actions. I stand corrected in that case. But that doesn't change the fact that \"freedom of speech\" in the Indian constitution doesn't allow you to challenge the territorial integrity of India. That will certainly be used in the court by her prosecutor. The government is allowed to place reasonable restrictions on speech. Not any restrictions. Merely questioning government policy and criticizing their actions doesn't amount to challenging it's sovereignty. The very word implies an actual action. As has the law on sedition for decades. To say she's a terrorist just because she's being offensive is a gross abuse of power. And it's the sort of thing tyrannical, authoritarian regimes do. Like the British Raj did. So no. This action isn't relevant to the constitution. It's grossly unconstitutional and a classic example of how the government has consistently eroded our basic fundamental freedoms while we've sat back cheering. If nothing else, consider that this case literally sat for more than 10 years. She made this speech in 2010. What terrorism or violence emerged from this speech? What possible link could you draw to any specific acts of violence that the government didn't feel the need to act for over a decade? If this was terrorism, why did they sit on their hands? If this wasn't urgent, why is it suddenly a problem? >given the choice between food and democracy, most would choose food, even if that food came via an authoritarian state. Most? No. 100% of people who don't have food will choose food over democracy. The only ones to choose democracy will be those who already have food. Anyway, I stopped caring about morals behind government policies and geopolitical actions a long time ago. I don't fear this step taken by the state as my opinion is in line with that of the state. I live in the state of mamata banerjee and she's a much worse dictator than Modi will ever be so nothing really fazes me anymore. >Merely questioning government policy and criticizing their actions doesn't amount to challenging it's sovereignty. The borders of India aren't \"government policy\". >nothing else, consider that this case literally sat for more than 10 years. She made this speech in 2010. What terrorism or violence emerged from this speech? Most radical Islamists get additional inspiration from people like her. She was heavily involved with Yasin Malik as well. >If this was terrorism, why did they sit on their hands? If this wasn't urgent, why is it suddenly a problem? It was long overdue. I don't know why they didn't do it till now, I am just happy that they finally did it. How is this authoritarian. Do u even know authoritarian means. How is his statement made in India authoritarian. Sometimes do study rather than spewing bs. >The borders of India aren't \"government policy\". They are actually. Simply having the opinion that you believe Kashmir was mishandled doesn't meet any reasonable definition of terrorism, nor does having the opinion or articulating it constitute an attack on India's sovereignty. The law on sedition and terrorism, and basic *criminal law* is predicated on *action*. Nor is there any demonstrable injury caused, nor has there been any violence. It is literally criminalizing criticism. You could turn around and call any critique of government action or policy an attack on India's sovereignty if speech itself was criminal. >Most radical Islamists get additional inspiration from people like her. They also get inspiration from the Quran. Is that criminal? They get inspired by nationalist leaders from India's history. Is evoking them criminal? A person is responsible for their acts, or when they act in conspiracy towards a criminal act. You could point to any dissenter towards the government and argue they \"inspire\" enemies of the state. You're basically slipping into straight up fascism there. The Brits used to justify locking up nationalists protesting them under similar pretexts. >She was heavily involved with Yasin Malik as well. If they have evidence of criminal conspiracy why haven't they charged her for that instead of dredging up a decade old *speech* given at an academic venue where literally *no* major political figure from Kashmir was present? >It was long overdue. I don't know why they didn't do it till now, I am just happy that they finally did it. So it was terrorism, but it was fine to ignore for over a decade? Wow, must have been really deadly terrorism. No, Meandering to separatist ideas is not a \"right\" in india. >I know it's bad but It is not bad it is directly targeting country sovereignty. In doing politics u shouldn't go such low but still she can express her thought >neutralizing\" literal Indian citizens is fucking crazy I don't believe in neutralizing but she should be careful about her words >andhbhakts have been sooo well-manipulated by the powers that be ki kisi ki JAAN lena is just casually thrown around. Why are u exaggerating things too much?? I don't think random comments on Reddit are good evidence for ur statement Saying Kashmir is not a part of India is not critiquing govt policy. What you call as different perspective on a historical process is deemed sedition by Indian laws. If you or she feels.othereise, she can fight that in courts. >Comment section proves the point Comment are not good evidence sir >India is heading down a bad path which will end in some genocide or something. Dude don't make assumptions based on the comment section and especially of social media. Go to the real world and see the reality People can have opinions that apply to her also. People are really sensitive about some topic whether it is Chinese on tibet, Americans on hawai, British in their former colony or whatever Is she going to be hung with out any legal tecourse or beaten to death on a public square? If so, then yes, you can equate that to Blasphemy law. > What you call as different perspective on a historical process is deemed sedition by Indian laws. If you or she feels.othereise, she can fight that in courts. No it isn't. Sedition requires an actual criminal act, either an incitement towards violence or public disorder. Words alone, and criticism alone, aren't sedition. Not only is there ample precedent on this, it is also because the IPC is *superseded* by the Indian Constitution. More to the point they haven't just accused her of sedition, they are accusing her of terrorism. And finally you're arguing a tautology. The issue isn't that the government has passed laws formally making such actions criminal. The issue is that in doing so the government is undermining basic constitutional and fundamental rights. The fact is that in criminalizing simply voicing an opinion they are trampling your rights. And cheering it on mindlessly proves India's increasing regressive slide. It is the perversion of Indian laws towards British Raj levels of tyrannical authoritarianism that needs to be protested. Indian laws also criminalized protest and dissent before 1947. Infact the British tended to make the exact same arguments as you and others cheering this on now make today. Were they then right? Because what the current government is doing to Roy is functionally identical to what was done to the likes of Gandhi and Savarkar. Were you living under a rock? Thrse laws have been innpractice for atleast a 40 years and some are for atleast 70 years. Read Article 19 in conjunction with Section 124. There are enough antecedents in terms of what can be tried under Sec 124. You then have NSA and UAPA that she much more stringent in interpretations. *legality kya hai, bas mann ka wahem hai.* TLDR. People being linguistic illiterates and not understanding the very words they themselves type. No it didn't back then... It actually took much less than that. For a non-muslim citizen of a NATO country with no criminal background or connection to terrorists and from a stable middle class upbringing? I don't think so. At most I would have spent a night or two in Jail for public mischief, and then been quickly deported and barred from entering the USA again. However, I may have been straight up shot and killed on the spot, either by trigger happy cops or a pissed off American. Obviously this is all hypothetical and I would never do it. Dude, take a chill pill. Bring your arguments instead of personally attacking me. But the above person has nowhere near the reach that Roy has nor are they deliberately trying to get a reaction out their audience, like Roy with her “Kashmir is not integral part of India”. Also your so called analogies suck, you are just making strawman arguments. The people of Kashmir doesn't feel that they are a part of India. No amount of shouting and claims from the Indian state and nationalists is going to change that feeling. The same goes with the legal claims made by Indian state on the back of an IOA signed under duress by a Hindu king whom the kashmiris never accepted as their ruler. The current government and its actions of removing 370, cutting of 4g internet for long periods, and giving untrammelled power to the army with zero accountability is not going to make kashmiris feel like they are part of the Indian nation state >But the above person has nowhere near the reach Your constitutional rights don't stop mattering just because more people listen to you. The issue is whether a person has a right to dissent or not. That right can't be predicated on one's supposed irrelevance. >that Roy has nor are they deliberately trying to get a reaction out their audience, Ok? Did Roy incite violence? Was her statement an inducement to violence in that moment? Its been over 10 years since she said it, and yet nothing happened? But it was a terrorist attack that destabilized India's sovereignty? Yet the government suffered no adverse consequences for over a decade? >like Roy with her “Kashmir is not integral part of India”. So Indians should only have rights to speech if they say things the government doesn't consider provocative? >Also your so called analogies suck, you are just making strawman arguments. The analogy is simple: If your speech was criminalized and you were called a terrorist for your comments here, would you be dancing around saying \"well India's sovereignty comes first, yaay for trampling fundamental rights?\" If the Government turned around and said your comment destabilized India's sovereignty and integrity, and called you a terrorist 10 years from now for this comment, would that be ok? There's no strawman here. Are you fine with this happening to you? Or do you only support fundamental rights being undermined when its for opinions you dislike? Kashmir is the important region where Pakistan, India, China and the previous Soviet Union (Central Asia) unite. Kashmir is a key intersection in the exceptionally focus of Asia. Its Regaining by India in whole would cut-off Pakistan from China and its whole ownership by Pakistan would leave India with no normal border with the previous Soviet Union. Stfu if you don’t know what you are talking about! I am a Hyderabadi and it is one of the Patriotic cities in the country. There are lot of Pro Pakistani sentiments in Indian Muslims many places across the country not just Hyderabad. >It's her right as an Indian to state her opinion. It's your right as an Indian to disagree. No. India does not have free speech like America. What she did was sedition, sedition is criminalised in India. There is no freedom of speech like the US in India. Heck a lot of democracies have restrictions. This is India mate. Get out of the internet and go see outside. >so essentially a blasphemy law. According to your logic. Hate speech is blasphemy laws We would revolt against ruling government if they do anything which compromises our national security, Vajpayee was playing dil-dosti in Pakistan while they were planning for and executed Kargil attack. those who wants to break India are so brainwashed by wokeathon they’d sell their mothers for a chance to belittle India. Nowadays every tom, dick and harry think he’s cool and woke if he bashes India and support those who wanna break it. Being woke doesn’t mean showing blind hatred towards your own country Notice how I didn't say anything about \"her\" at all. This isn't about her. This is about freedom of speech in the so called \"largest democracy\" in the world. One day we will see the parallels between Kashmir and the Israeli occupation of Palestine but that day is not today. Ah ok usually buffer would be used to describe a region in between a dangerous and vulnerable area. Calling BS on that. >No it isn't. Sedition requires an actual criminal act, either an incitement towards violence or public disorder. Words alone, and criticism alone, aren't sedition. Not only is there ample precedent on this, it is also because the IPC is superseded by the Indian Constitution. I think you have not read the note from LG's office, The case was filed in 2010 over comments Roy made at a conference on Kashmir called “Azadi – the Only Way Ahead” – “azadi” means freedom or liberation and is often used as a slogan for the Kashmiri independence movement. The initial complaint alleged that speeches by Roy and her co-defendants were provocative in nature and jeopardized public security by suggesting that Kashmir was never part of India and advocating for Kashmiri independence, the Lieutenant Governor’s office said in a statement. So, prima facie, there is merit in the complaint. Whether Article 19 super cedes Sec 124 of IPC is a grey area. Art 19 comes with a clear restriction that forbade incitement, hate speech and the most important one on sovereignty and integrity of the Union. There are enough rulings in both State high courts and SC where Roy can get relief. >The issue is that in doing so the government is undermining basic constitutional and fundamental rights. The fact is that in criminalizing simply voicing an opinion they are trampling your rights. The constitution and the amendments were all passed by the govt following due process ratified by all. In a constitutional democracy, there is always a majority and a minority, and it is a firm belief that somebody's rights are always trampled. >Because what the current government is doing to Roy is functionally identical to what was done to the likes of Gandhi and Savarkar. Apples and Oranges. British Indian Govt was not a constitutional democracy, India is. The people make the laws through their reps and they have the right to throw them off the power when they feel shortchanged. Sounds pretty much the same shit the Indian state says. Call it bs but can't give any credible evidence to counter the truth. Try shouting louder that Kashmir valley is an integral part of India and maybe the make believe will become the truth sometime. You should also shout out loud that kashmiris love the Indian army and their daily harassment YOU can say whatever, doesnt change the fact that Kashmir is part of INDIA and will always will be. If people are not happy, they can leave for Kashmir or China. Pakistan has already sold half of the POK to the Chinese already. So yeah keep BSing, doesnt change FACTS. Hari Singh signed the documents to be with India. You and your ilk can try. We know how to handle people like you. Now shoo, go away. Read history Go fk Israeli occupation first Don't disagree with you completely, but Texas and other southern states literally went to war with the Union to secede from the union. It was the civil war. Ireland also had a history of lot of communal violence before it split into Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. I think you should too cos anyone who has ready anything about Kashmir or been there or seen any documentary about it will connect with what I've said. Get a grip Don't disagree with you completely, but Texas and other southern states literally went to war with the Union to secede from the union. It was the civil war. Yeah, but it was a full blown civil war. It’s not like either of the parties carried out mass killings of civilians and hide in the bushes. They fought the first industrialised war with mass weapons and good triumphed over evil in the end. My point is there were no proxies or suicide bombings like scales of which we see from radical Islamic terrorists. Ireland also had a history of lot of communal violence before it split into Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. I recall “isis” calling to take up arms in Ireland and some Irish dissidents reportedly had links to left-wing extremists and have traveled across the EU to take part in socialist and Marxist events. So go figure.. >Individuals like Roy are nothing but promoters of their toxic extremism, backed by Pakistan and China, operating through POK, utterly disregarding the rest of the state's population. Have there been any connections made between her and seditious forces beyond sharing common political idealogue? Because if she is just an intellectual, digging up dirt in her statements is not a good look for our authorities. You see Kashmir is partly in India, which they acceded , Pakistan snatched some and gifted some to Chin and Chinis have Eastern part Kashmir is Not land dispute its want It's part of India and Pak and Chin snatched some of it and little bit of extremism etc. In Palestinian occupied apartheid colonial regime that's based on hate and Land dispute and geopolitical power struggle cocktailed in imperialism These are way diffrent problem I have come to a realization that there are no facts now, only opinions and that too negative opinions by media. I am myself living in a non democratic country and the safety for everyone here is so good that i just don't miss free speech/democracy. Always criticizing someone without working on solution would never bring any positive outcome. Criticizing is good but upto a limit. Due to social media and free speech, everyone just criticize and not do anything else. Isis is not a left wing group lmao..... Not sure about what you're trying to say Standard of living and democracy/personal freedom aren't necessarily connected. I mean look at Singapore for example. Singapore also doesn’t have much of free speech. It is v much restricted by government. We are using a single dimensional limited understanding of our complex history and transposing it to the modern context to judge anything, anyone who has a different opinion, prematurely. In ancient Indian history, we were neither proponents of democracy, nor freedom of speech or justice. Majority believes, the might is always right. In our collective consciousness dictated by might, people like Arundathi Roy are bound to be demonised and hounded in the garb of modern terminologies like National sovereignty, country. Even though the context of issue is complicated that takes us back to times where the notion of India was non-existent. It was in a different context when I said “isis chief al Baghdadi called upon Irish people to take up arms and some of them were arrested in links with isis. My point is Islam supports these types of proxy wars and influence people into carrying out terrorist. Left wing extremists also supported Irish separatists. Those 2 might or may not be linked. I believe religion is a primary source of evil in this world, it includes Hindus, Jews, Christian’s and every religion on earth. but Islam turns people into brainless zombies to carry out barbaric attacks on innocents and terrorising the world. But yeah, religion in general is the culprit. It worked pretty well in China. It has its faults but developed them to where they are now. Maybe in 50 it will move to free utopia like progressive twats wants in china. Progression or development of society is likes going through stages and not by utopian fanatsy. China's authoritarian development has come at the cost of basic civil rights and freedoms. Yes India could try and pursue China's path. It would involve most people losing the ability to critically engage with their government. Your problem of course would be simple. Today you see Roy as an acceptable sacrifice for the sake of development. You're fine with that. Tomorrow however you could be the sacrifice. And something tells me you'd be far less sanguine about that. If that makes those of us trying to defend basic civil liberties, progressive twats, so be it. I or you being a sacrifice or not sacrifice doesn't matter in developement. you are just a cog in the system Society develops like this. Europe developed like this, America same, china now India. Nothing new. Thats exactly what I mean. It is objectively less free than India, but has amongst the highest standards of living in the world. But you cant say literally anything. By this logic religious hatred is justified bro all he is saying that we are better than these countries, which is contrary to what the reports say he means that we are not that bad Yes, there are exceptions to free speech. Hate speech is one of them. However, simply discussing the matter of Kashmir is not hate speech. It's civil and healthy conversation. The union of Kashmir to India is an extremely complicated and nuance subject and there are many differing opinions regarding the matter. Simply having an opinion and discussing the topic should not be a jailable offense. That's how authoritarian dictatorships function. May be you are right but i feel that putter limitations to democracy help government fo us on progress rather than putting focus on replying to every free speech media person. For ex: BBC making reports on India, government has to spend their cricial time responding I see what you mean friend, and sure I think that India probably can not just go full wild west \"total freedom\" mode without serious negative effects. Honestly though, I think moderation is necessary or things are going to spiral out of control. I mean for gods sakes, people are saying that Roy should be extra-judicially shot for this, which again was an incorrect stupid statement. In fact I myself have gotten multiple replies/messages saying that I should be jailed or killed, and I'm not even backing separatism, only disagreeing with prosecuting her! Le moot diya tere usoolon pr. Ja ke ro le. Kashmir is a part of India, and it will be a part of India no matter what you think. Try talking about US states seceding from the USA and see how much free speech remains in that particular state. Moot to tumhe peene ki aadat hai. You would lol a guy was arrested in airport because he called a security a na*i."
