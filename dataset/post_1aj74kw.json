        "Okay, so hear me out, I am in college rn but since childhood, I lived in a lot of cities because my dad has to transfer due to work reasons. \n\nSo in Lucknow, I lived in Gomti Nagar, it was a posh area with mostly high ranking military/police families living there, and in my block, there was only 1 Muslim house. I guess the head of the house was ex police, but they were normal people, didn't trouble anyone or anything. \n\nThen one day, the head died because the pacemaker malfunctioned or some other problem, and then, the next day, the whole block was jammed with 10s of bikes and cars, and people couldn't go out (it was Sunday so it was okay). The relatives of that guy (all Muslims) came and blocked the way, to meet and share their condolences. But the problem was that they were irritating the whole colony. One senior citizen, ex Army, went their and complained about it, but one guy (who didn't leave their) got angry and then nearly jumped on the old man, who was also taken aback, but other people hold him off. \n\nThen there was a large commotion, police were called, and everything happened literally in front of my house (my house was next to the entrance and so was theirs). \n\nThe main problem I feel is that Muslims are really, idk, uneducated and uncultured. They live in closed off societies and their upbringing is not for a gentleman. Not all Muslims again, I had/still have Muslim friends from Delhi and Lucknow and all of them are fine (they are rich), but most off hand personal random interaction with Muslim was always negative. Like they are either stealing something, doing dubious stuff, harassing women near college, so as a normal guy, Muslim still are a big negative for me. \n\nAnd I feel they really don't wanna change. I have read a bit Qur'an and Hadith and shit is not good sounding okay. At least we talk about Manusmriti and wrong this in it (Ram cutting head of Shudra) and we debate on it, but there's 100s of instances like that in Qur'an/Hadith and Muslims will not even talk about it normally, it's like a cult or something rather than a religion. \n\nI mean sorry man, I am not Pro BJP, don't even vote for them, but I'm really not a fan of the other side.

        "Also about poverty not sure if it is actually going down. Usually poverty graphs are shown as declining with increase in income but the income won't be adjusted to inflation. Income adjusted to inflation is actual poverty level.",

        "I would argue otherwise. When you have a government that thrives on hatred of others, fake news these things are bound to increase multifold. Also the lax attitude of law enforcement turning a blind eye towards such acts. We also saw mob violence getting glorified where the perpetrators themselves will film the act and spread it, receiving a heroic image among masses. \nThese are all things that if the government want to can certainly limit to a great extent.",
        "Yeah because the masses fucking like it. The masses are stupid as fuck and will accept any reels with a cool enough edit as heroic. The government can do it but it won't...to please the fucking masses. we need to change as a society because at the end of the day government is made by and out of those same people",

You cannot enforce laws when police is scared of losing their job. \n\nAny kind of law that doesn't directly benefit the masses people start protesting and rioting even without knowing what the law holds. Government only keep those laws strict which generate revenue for it. We people have to discipline ourselves. We are not children that we have to be punished to be in line.",
        "Religious hate is a funny thing. It existed before Independence and is continuing after that. Nehru - Modi, every regime went through that shit called Religious Hate/bigotry and the numbers are huge. Few would get reported and a few wouldn't. \n\nI'm sharing a few personal experiences I've faced. \n\nSo, during my Teens I was always made to live in guilt by my classmates. They always went hammer and tongs over me for belonging to a religion which demolished a mosque and killed people in Gujurat. And funny enough one of my classmates would sing this on my face \"Raam baan M**** Teri\" etc. And once I had this talk with my dad and he reached out to school for such trash and surprise surprise, the guy's parents were top notch people one was in the highest post in Government and mother was a principal at a big school. That's when my parents decided to move me on from the school and the obvious reason is that teenagers are behaving that way and especially from a well educated family and such a place isn't the right one for any sort of education. \n\nThen during my undergrad, I was happy that I got admitted at a college close to my place and then had a few of my friends/acquaintances there. But here reality hit me hard. Those innocent souls whom I'd share lunch boxes with during schooling would talk about Non-Halal, Them ruling India. Without waiting further, moved to another college. There was an option to stick around and mind my life, but such toxicity wasn't my cup of coffee. \n\nAnd before COVID a group of 200-300 people thronged my colony to thrash the society members for erecting a gate. Now ours is a gated community and there's a shortcut which was used by many folks. And then there's an open plot near our colony which has been used to park those trucks, buses, transport vehicles etc. But overtime they were parking it in the colony and were sleeping in colony parks, brushing in the open etc and to stop that nuisance we decided to take help of police to get those gates. Funny part, the same day we erected those pillars, a mob of 200-300 people thronged the Colony and they were over the top citing we were stopping a certain Section of people from going to their place of worship. Now the police didn't register a case and amicably sorted this. And there would be many many such incidents which aren't reported. \n\nThroughout my growing years, I've heard so much filth about Hindus, Hindu gods etc from people who studied in my school, college. But people never coined the term \"Religious Hate\" and most of the slurs I heard of came from affluent family kids. \n\nMaybe there was poverty in Manmohan Singh's rule and no Religious bigotry and the moment Modi came looks like every Indian Hindu is a religious bigot all of a sudden. Convenient graphical charts are funny and funny enough debating on such shit is more non-sensical.",
        "Seeing the plight of people around me post 2016, I don't believe this a bit.\n\nMaybe they have shifted goalposts.",
        "There must also be some relation of hatred to mental health. \n\nI have seen people with lots of hate agitated, frustrated, think they are very knowledgable(crap knowledge usually), lack in rational thinking",
        "Agreed. My anecdotal evidences alone do not mean anything. However, when combined with the regular news (lynching , release of rapists before election, language and statement of ruling party members) and anecdotal evidences of my peers it does tend to tell you what's happening.",
        "Partition was just after independence from British control. Different times.\n\nReligion has always been an issue and becomes bigger when powerful leaders utilize it for their benefit.",
        "Intern made the graphs üòÇ unpaid intern",
        "Yeah it's very much around here. In Northern states it apparently seems there is going to be a large scale Rwanda style genocide if this problem is not resolved. People need to be aware of what evil forces they are dealing with here. India will be finished without keeping its diversity and democracy alive.",
        "nahi bhai idhar sab chilled chal raha hai",
        "yeah, 2016-17 me hi rise karna start kiya aur 2016-17 me jio boom bhi hua tha.",
        "I don‚Äôt understand why 27% Hindus wouldn‚Äôt want a Jain neighbor. Or a Sikh neighbor. Make it make sense.",
        "Any smell of meat disgusts people."

In my observation, we are transitioning to religious segregation. There are religion based areas in every city. Most people prefer buying homes with neighbors from their own community. Large apartment complexes may be an exception. Try buying a flat in Mumbai and then you'll see Someone pointed out, fairly, that based on the Pew Study, it cannot be said religious hatred is going up.

Ram Ranjya in Hindu Rashtra or Akhand Bharat is only highway to inner happiness. What is progress anyway! ^/s Is there a correlation? Even if religious hatred is going up, these are two unrelated data. Please /r/India, you are the voice of reason, don't go that path. I wasn‚Äôt gonna. But I don‚Äôt think LATimes & CJP can be accused of propaganda. LATimes is a very reputable news publication in the US and CJP is a Washington based think tank. Now, you‚Äôre right in saying the data might have been arranged in a way as to make it seem it‚Äôs worse than it actually is, but I can only rely on data I can find on the internet. If you can find reports from trustworthy sources that suggest otherwise, more than happy to take a look. Not really. India is an ambitious country. India wants to rich and powerful. In order to be both, you need cohesion in your society. So it doesn‚Äôt matter if you become rich, you still need the entirety of your country to work in tandem with one another to achieve common ends. The data on religious hatred may not be an entirely accurate representation of reality in ground, although I see no reason for it not to be. But you cannot have a country if one half of it hates the other half. That level of hate is not sustainable. \"The report came from Hindutva Watch (HW), a Washington-based project that monitors hate speech and hate crimes against India‚Äôs religious minorities, including Muslims, who account for 14% of the country‚Äôs 1.4 billion population. From its launch in 2021, Hindutva Watch has been a thorn in the side of Hindu nationalists who have been provoking anti-Muslim sentiment for years\" From LA Times, see godi media is All written here they just transferred the responsibility to HW And i didn't even searched for second group at this point because you said it's think tank You know most think tank are circle jerk of people with particular ideology and it's least reputable thing to quote, When does poverty rate changed last? So do you mean that we should await on economic grown till all religious hatred is eradicated? I feel the two, economy and intolerance, are disjoint and should be handled disjointly. If central govt is performing well economically, kudos to them. They are not doing enough for minorities, hold them accountable and ask the tough questions. That's oppositions job. Don't vote for modi or do Nota but don't paint India as a lost case. Nothing is 100% without an agenda. If you started playing that game, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to trust anything ever again. The best we can do is reasonably infer whether a report is likely to be accurate or not given what we know. Based on recent events in India, including hyper-charged language from politicians, reality on the ground and news reports on violence, I don‚Äôt find it hard to believe that religious hatred would have likely gone up in recent years. That does not come as a surprise to me. You can research Pew Studies, no one can accuse those of propaganda. Will give you the same answer. Or NYT, WashPost or WSJ. What exactly about HW‚Äôs study methods, data collection, etc, do you find to be controversial or inaccurate? And I‚Äôm open to you sharing reports from trustworthy sources that claim otherwise. Lmao what is this hatredüòÇ arent politicians making thousands of crores This has more to do with easy access to Internet than it is about BJP, there have always been instigator of religion politics in every government, but free internet for everyone gave everyone to voice their unsaid opinions within the vile of anonymity. Most people are doing it to fit in a group and look cool and get internet brownie points as they don't have any job to so and this is the most sense of validation they have had in life ever. They do it again and again with like minded people in groups to get a sense of power and security. Its not the government....its the people. Based on my regular conversations with people during my trips to India, I would say hatred towards Muslims have gone up. That shows to me that religious harmony has gone down. No, I never said that. I‚Äôm asking in the future, when India is reasonably well-off and has decent living standards, what will be done to manage hate? That will not disappear overnight once India gets rich. That is what my question was, nothing more. > Official poverty measurement essentially stopped in 2011/12. There are hints of bad news behind that pause. Leaked data from the 2017/18 National Sample Survey showed a startling 3.7 percent decline in real consumption over six years, and the survey was never released. Though in fairness, as discussed on this blog in the past, those preliminary numbers seemed implausibly dire. First riots and religious exclusivity is always been their what you are seeing is just internet exposure to it, unless you believe before 2014 we were in harmony, if yes then take you pills and read some news Second pew is trusted so kindly provide same research by pew and I will accept NYT, Wp or any other cite if dependent on third party research then that obviously make it untrustworthy unless we confirm authenticity of third party For HW their name is enough to say they are going to manipulate facts just to show one side bad it's common sense they hate one ideology and do anything to opress it, i mean read the name Now I am not debating is it good idiology or bad I am just saying use your brain dude and yes their are neutral source it's just your brain is more comfortable to consume the biased one Is it bad offcourse not, if we have sanghi we need people like you to counter them but you're not at our level yet a person earning 10k a month 10 years back is earning 20k now. the number may deceive you to believe that his earnings have increased by 100% but in terms purchasing power due to inflation his earnings are at same level or lesser as compared to 10 year back. That makes sense. Need to be addressed. Not sure how though. I dont agree that poverty is getting reduced. One no one likes being called poor and two the government has been working overtime to ensure that the benchmark for being poor can be crossed by even a baby. Why do I say so - three reasons 1. personal Incomes earned are taxed heavily through direct and indirect (GST) - and there are virtually zero rebates 2. The cost of products has gone up - which means that I can buy less and not buy more (sign of increased income). people are no able to move from existential buys to aspiration buys. eg, the volume of entry level cars sold has fallen indicating low level of conversion from 2 wheelers to cars. 3. High levels of unemployment and even for daily wage earners - number of days employed is going down What do you mean nothing is 100% without an agenda? If that was actually true, wouldn't Mr Hyper Intelligent know that already? That's like saying history is always written with a bias. Who are we supposed to trust then? You dont think incidences of hate crime are on the rise in real life? damn 0 content and 2 attempts at bashing OP For fuck sake india was not a secular peradise before 2014 and riots were not rare occurrence And for God sake it's clear from HW's name that they hate a particular ideology and at this point they will do what benefit their cause if it's not a conflict of interest then what is In short tu kisi political party ka local newspaper padhle unke research or HW ki research mein koi difference nahi hoga, And for other sources agar unki khud ki research hai share it and if they are quoting third party like HW then you are smart enough Jha tak baat hai neutral source ki, abb koi iss topic ko research like samjhta nahi toh kya karoon mein... And for trust issue Bhai i would rather live with no knowledge then half knowledge, ek khawat hai na isse pe Hindi mein So Crux is chill maar bro why just the average muslim brother today I think Biggest hater award goes to 'Jain'. No offense but most of the Jain folks, I've met with, have a sense of superiority. Well, certainly your \"regular conversations\" aren't the best way to judge and generalise 150 cr people. So according to you poverty is going up? Because my grandparents won't even eat aalo pyaz gahar mooli and you are talking about those persons who regularly has meat in their diets. 3% with as hindu neighbours says it all The data used for this MDPI is collected as per the survey provided by Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) which has a standard list of questions for every country. India's MPI was first launched in 2021 after consulting with Oxford and UNDP experts, while the global MPI has been going on since 2010. If there is a faulty baseline, it is going on since the global MPI began. Funny how you expect an organisation with the name \"Hindutwa Watch\" to publishe an unbiased opinion about hindus without a pre-set agenda which is absolutely clear from their name itself. Again American propaganda; Jains do not hate Muslims, its just that their dietary preferences are polar opposite, hence the hesitation. I knew Jain's were the most retards of all.. Buddhist people seem chill, and surprised that Muslims don't really mind having hindus as neighbours.. Looks like now gun business is gonna boom interesting stuff thanks for links What does it matter if anyone eats in their own homes? Nobody is forcing you. Bigotry is so ingrained in some Jains that they don't even realize it That sounds America, means we are on a way to America. And not the America who says, make America great again. But the great america itself. r/India, voice of reason? Haha! Sir, either you don't visit r/India much or you are enjoying the perks of legalised alcohol in gift city. Yes, i cant stop anyone from eating in their own house. That is exactly i would prefer not to live with a muslim neighbour. What's wrong it in? Yes, that's why we have University of Oxford to calculate the poverty index. And the global MPI isn't based on govt data?? Just curious, as our data isn't worth shit nowadays. What has happened to Jains? They are minority themselves yet this much %? But how is that effecting you? I can't understand. You follow your thing. Let others follow their thing. Isn't that fair? Not necessarily.. Poverty may be going down.. But our govts penchant for massaging numbers to suit their political needs makes it impossible to truly gauge the efficiency and effectiveness of programs meant to alleviate poverty. Changing baselines and standards of measuring success in poverty alleviation has been a much criticized move of Modis Govt for a while now.. Institutions who's only purpose is to collect and analyze data have themselves complained about the arbitrary changes.. Not everything is about political parties, but then to ignore the actions of a political party done for politics is just a idiotic response. How do we alleviate poverty effectively if we don't know who to help?? And how much help is needed?? What if the new standards make it easier for people who DON'T require assistance to avail programmes meant for the poorest of our fellow citizens?? We should be very concerned. let me call bullshit!... if poverty rate is going down why feed 80cr people with free rice and oil... the last time 80cr people were on food subsidy was in the 1990s 2014 was 40cr-50cr. Also what is THIS MULTIDIMENTIAL POVERTY INDEX... please explain ... what are the parameters it takes into account... if you are earning more than 1000RS a month you are not POOR..according to niti aayog. ALL A JHUMLA to make you feel good AND NOT SEE HOW BAD WE ARE DOING ECONOMICALLY..how high cost has eaten away all savings and any increase in earnings!! HOW EXPENSIVE THINGS HAVE BECOME in the LAST 4 YEARS!...look at your house budgets and tell if you aren ot spending more than what you are earning and i am not tlaking about those people who play the stock market just your very avg middle class house holds. how many people are on food subsidy ?? .. that amount was 40-50 crs people on food subsidy in 2014! 24 cr people were pulled out of extreme poverty thats data both endorsed by the world bank and imf during 2004-2014 what is multi dimensional poverty index ...if you can uncover that you will know where you stand!..which is basically you are right! So ‚ÄúHuman Rights Watch‚Äù isn‚Äôt about human rights then? If HW really had a pre-set agenda, surely they‚Äôd want to be effective in spreading related propaganda? And if so many people, including you, think the name itself is suggestive of propagandist content, they definitely did not do a good job by naming it that when the name itself is attracting so much controversy? So it‚Äôs either they‚Äôre dumb and don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing or the name isn‚Äôt really suggestive of propaganda and that‚Äôs a false alarm. Besides, I attached other reports as well and feel free to post ones from trustworthy sources that claim otherwise and I‚Äôll be more than happy to take a look. I love india /s What is the definition of poverty in this data? Which is why there are surveys, and they indicate the same thing. The question is not about living in the same room or eating the same food. How can somebody in the next house affect my diet? It's a lost cause if people don't change. It'll be civil war and collapse. > they definitely did not do a good job by naming it that when the name itself is attracting so much controversy They dont shy away from showing off their agenda, people like you do. \" **Hindutva Watch** is an independent research project that documents [hate crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime) and [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_on_social_media) against [religious minorities in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_minorities_in_India). Founded by [Raqib Hameed Naik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raqib_Hameed_Naik), the project focuses on tracking hate crimes and human rights abuses committed by radicalized Hindus and [Hindutva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva) militia groups in the country. \" If you still cant see the agenda, either youre blind or youre just drowned deep down in your biases. A reason for it could be social media. Most of the content is of extreme acts which are very rare. Plus people get attached to content they like and have a similar opinion on. Generally you become a part of people you surround yourself with. Nowadays u surround yourself with opinions you like and stop thinking about the other side. Kinda like brainwashing Sir it's all hypothetical, it is my preference to live with neighbours who are parallel to my faith. If people pf other preferences live in my neighborhood, it's not like ki bhai ye mt bana mere bgl m rhna h to...we are ok with it...you are offending like if I will kill if it's Christian muslim sikh or whatever. Even our jain dharam teaches calmness ahinsa, you follow your faiths we will follow ours. I won't eat meat and I would prefer ki meat omlette ki smell meri naak tk bhi na aaye but I won't be entering your house and take your leg piece, enjoy you lollipops sir Wait, what? üòÇüòÇ But you said the name has conspiratorial undertones. You‚Äôre annoyed an organization set up for the sole purpose of tracking Hindu hate against minorities has that that in its description? What are they supposed to say? They‚Äôre stating their purpose very clearly. What kind of propaganda is that? And what‚Äôs inaccurate or scandalous about their reports or data specifically? You haven‚Äôt answered that. Like I said, I attached other reports too. More than happy to see reports from you that are from trustworthy sources. I really am not biased. assumptions much? Lame calculator? The guy made a reasonable argument with a good example, he doesn't have to produce a full blown oxford calculator to state his point. Ironically your point goes mute because of your lame condescending tone. You mean from the chart, that if Congress were in power the urban poverty would have gone down faster than it has under the current rule? Obviously the rate of reduction had slowed. /s Okay, so hear me out, I am in college rn but since childhood, I lived in a lot of cities because my dad has to transfer due to work reasons. So in Lucknow, I lived in Gomti Nagar, it was a posh area with mostly high ranking military/police families living there, and in my block, there was only 1 Muslim house. I guess the head of the house was ex police, but they were normal people, didn't trouble anyone or anything. Then one day, the head died because the pacemaker malfunctioned or some other problem, and then, the next day, the whole block was jammed with 10s of bikes and cars, and people couldn't go out (it was Sunday so it was okay). The relatives of that guy (all Muslims) came and blocked the way, to meet and share their condolences. But the problem was that they were irritating the whole colony. One senior citizen, ex Army, went their and complained about it, but one guy (who didn't leave their) got angry and then nearly jumped on the old man, who was also taken aback, but other people hold him off. Then there was a large commotion, police were called, and everything happened literally in front of my house (my house was next to the entrance and so was theirs). The main problem I feel is that Muslims are really, idk, uneducated and uncultured. They live in closed off societies and their upbringing is not for a gentleman. Not all Muslims again, I had/still have Muslim friends from Delhi and Lucknow and all of them are fine (they are rich), but most off hand personal random interaction with Muslim was always negative. Like they are either stealing something, doing dubious stuff, harassing women near college, so as a normal guy, Muslim still are a big negative for me. And I feel they really don't wanna change. I have read a bit Qur'an and Hadith and shit is not good sounding okay. At least we talk about Manusmriti and wrong this in it (Ram cutting head of Shudra) and we debate on it, but there's 100s of instances like that in Qur'an/Hadith and Muslims will not even talk about it normally, it's like a cult or something rather than a religion. I mean sorry man, I am not Pro BJP, don't even vote for them, but I'm really not a fan of the other side. They are more dangerous and uneducated than I would like tbh. OP provided a chart with clear data with source mentioning as University of Oxford in the post. So, it would be relevant if the above commenter is making arguments with that data. Instead, he's challenging the data and arguing against it which is kind of lame, if you think about it. I am not assuming. Check the chart in the post. Source is mentioned as University of Oxford. To answer your first question - yes, poverty rates have been on a downward trajectory for the last ~20 years. Did you validate your claim? This fellow's example could very well be accounted for in the study, but you are clearly stating that he/she is arguing against it, where is your proof behind this? The reason (with an example) that is fellow is stating above is completely valid and logical What Sikhs are uncomfortable around Hindus now? Is the situation that bad? Also wtf is up with the Jains? Danm Jain's be hating hard. Also about poverty not sure if it is actually going down. Usually poverty graphs are shown as declining with increase in income but the income won't be adjusted to inflation. Income adjusted to inflation is actual poverty level. These numbers are fake. I don't trust any stat given by the government anymore. one‚Äôs be sacrificing a goat in their house and the other will harbour an ecosystem in theirs. What‚Äôs the issue? people need to learn to mind their business. Need these data to actually interpret anything 1.population data 2.Population to religion data 3.poverty data 4.Hate speech data 5.Demographic to hatred ratio data Without these and intepreting a single point data is meaningless May be reducing from 60 to 30 is easter than going further down. But if the numbers are right , congress did a good job. Poverty isn't reducing. The bj party is just using a different metric to mask it. How can poverty reduce with unemployment on the rise, high inflation, high petrol prices etc.? I agree man, we were such a harmonious country that we needed to partition it in terms of religion. I would argue otherwise. When you have a government that thrives on hatred of others, fake news these things are bound to increase multifold. Also the lax attitude of law enforcement turning a blind eye towards such acts. We also saw mob violence getting glorified where the perpetrators themselves will film the act and spread it, receiving a heroic image among masses. These are all things that if the government want to can certainly limit to a great extent. Yeah because the masses fucking like it. The masses are stupid as fuck and will accept any reels with a cool enough edit as heroic. The government can do it but it won't...to please the fucking masses. we need to change as a society because at the end of the day government is made by and out of those same people In a society like India change can only come top-down. If laws are strict and unbiased, masses will behave. If government keeps it lax so that they can profit from the divide and hatred, nothing will change. It‚Äôs the people, and the government is taking advantage of that. And i simply dont prefer to live near someone whose sacrificing a goat, its my personal choice, isnt it? People really need to learn to mind their business, Strick laws tumble in the face of power culture India has. You cannot enforce laws when police is scared of losing their job. Any kind of law that doesn't directly benefit the masses people start protesting and rioting even without knowing what the law holds. Government only keep those laws strict which generate revenue for it. We people have to discipline ourselves. We are not children that we have to be punished to be in line. Religious hate is a funny thing. It existed before Independence and is continuing after that. Nehru - Modi, every regime went through that shit called Religious Hate/bigotry and the numbers are huge. Few would get reported and a few wouldn't. I'm sharing a few personal experiences I've faced. So, during my Teens I was always made to live in guilt by my classmates. They always went hammer and tongs over me for belonging to a religion which demolished a mosque and killed people in Gujurat. And funny enough one of my classmates would sing this on my face \"Raam baan M**** Teri\" etc. And once I had this talk with my dad and he reached out to school for such trash and surprise surprise, the guy's parents were top notch people one was in the highest post in Government and mother was a principal at a big school. That's when my parents decided to move me on from the school and the obvious reason is that teenagers are behaving that way and especially from a well educated family and such a place isn't the right one for any sort of education. Then during my undergrad, I was happy that I got admitted at a college close to my place and then had a few of my friends/acquaintances there. But here reality hit me hard. Those innocent souls whom I'd share lunch boxes with during schooling would talk about Non-Halal, Them ruling India. Without waiting further, moved to another college. There was an option to stick around and mind my life, but such toxicity wasn't my cup of coffee. And before COVID a group of 200-300 people thronged my colony to thrash the society members for erecting a gate. Now ours is a gated community and there's a shortcut which was used by many folks. And then there's an open plot near our colony which has been used to park those trucks, buses, transport vehicles etc. But overtime they were parking it in the colony and were sleeping in colony parks, brushing in the open etc and to stop that nuisance we decided to take help of police to get those gates. Funny part, the same day we erected those pillars, a mob of 200-300 people thronged the Colony and they were over the top citing we were stopping a certain Section of people from going to their place of worship. Now the police didn't register a case and amicably sorted this. And there would be many many such incidents which aren't reported. Throughout my growing years, I've heard so much filth about Hindus, Hindu gods etc from people who studied in my school, college. But people never coined the term \"Religious Hate\" and most of the slurs I heard of came from affluent family kids. Maybe there was poverty in Manmohan Singh's rule and no Religious bigotry and the moment Modi came looks like every Indian Hindu is a religious bigot all of a sudden. Convenient graphical charts are funny and funny enough debating on such shit is more non-sensical. Seeing the plight of people around me post 2016, I don't believe this a bit. Maybe they have shifted goalposts. There must also be some relation of hatred to mental health. I have seen people with lots of hate agitated, frustrated, think they are very knowledgable(crap knowledge usually), lack in rational thinking Agreed. My anecdotal evidences alone do not mean anything. However, when combined with the regular news (lynching , release of rapists before election, language and statement of ruling party members) and anecdotal evidences of my peers it does tend to tell you what's happening. Partition was just after independence from British control. Different times. Religion has always been an issue and becomes bigger when powerful leaders utilize it for their benefit. Intern made the graphs üòÇ unpaid intern Yeah it's very much around here. In Northern states it apparently seems there is going to be a large scale Rwanda style genocide if this problem is not resolved. People need to be aware of what evil forces they are dealing with here. India will be finished without keeping its diversity and democracy alive. nahi bhai idhar sab chilled chal raha hai yeah, 2016-17 me hi rise karna start kiya aur 2016-17 me jio boom bhi hua tha. I don‚Äôt understand why 27% Hindus wouldn‚Äôt want a Jain neighbor. Or a Sikh neighbor. Make it make sense. Any smell of meat disgusts people."
