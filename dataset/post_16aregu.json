Thakur told activist Niranjan Bhatwal from Maharshtra that the choice was his, to call his country ‘Bharat’ or ‘India’. Nobody, no authority, State or court, had the power to dictate to citizens what they should call their country.\n\n“If you want to call this country ‘Bharat’, go right ahead and call it Bharat. If somebody chooses to call this country India, let him call it India. We will not interfere,” Chief Justice Thakur had said.\n\nAn identical petition again came up before the Supreme Court, this time before Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, in June 2020. The country at the time was grappling with the pandemic. The hearing, this time, was held virtually. The plea wanted ‘India’ to be struck off Article 1, saying there should be “uniformity” about the name of the nation.\n\nChief Justice Bobde responded by pointing out to the petitioner, Namah, that “Bharat and India are both names given in the Constitution. India is already called ‘Bharat’ in the Constitution”.\n\nThough Chief Justice Bobde did not entertain the petition, he suggested that the petition could be transformed into a representation and forwarded to the Central Ministries, primarily the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.",
