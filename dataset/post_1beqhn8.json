    "selftext": " \n\n**1.

        "All developed countries got rid of capital punishment",
        "read somewhere that it makes it worse as culprit is more likely to kill the victim so he doesn't get caught (as he would die if that happened). \n\nespecially in a country like ours where justice system is so bad, ig it is more likely to backfire.",
        "Ah yes... Now what about the cases where the male gets ropd by a female or a male....\n\nTell me THAT.",
        "That is also molestation and a crime, bas you need to have courage to fight for justice. Rape of a man is also wrong.",

        "I heard an argument that the reason we don't have \"death penalty\" for rape is that because law tends to look out for rape victims life . We have death penalty reserved for rape+murder(of the rape victim) , now if we change the law and put out death penalty for rape, so there's same penalty for rape and rape+ murder (of the rape victim) . Now after putting out this new law rapes won't stop in a single day, but then what will happen is that everytime there's a rape somewhere there's a sureshot chance(9/10) that the rape victim will be murdered by the offender. Because he'll be hanged for rape so he will not leave the victim alive to even testify , because now penalty for rape+murder(of the rape victim) is same as rape so , if he's climbing the noose he'll not leave the victim alive either.   Now assuming there's a rape happening every hour across India, you are looking at a murder rate higher than a mountain. And all this is said in assumption that every rape case filed is not false.",
        "Actually making the punishment worse could be counter productive. If the sentence is death, the rapist is incentivised to kill the victim so that they don't report, if it's jail they might let the victim live. Also in the majority of cases, the rapist is someone the victim knows and trusts so they are less likely to report if the sentence is death.",

        "Yes I honestly dont want ki hamari society Saudi jasi barbaric ho jaye. You wanna know how \"good\" situation of women in these Saudi countries is? Come on dont be this negligent. \nThere is a reason Legal systems are there. Solution is to make them better along with changing mindset of society, not to evolve even more backwards as society.",

India has reasonable laws to punish culprits, the problem is that these aren't property enforced.",
        "Plenty of rapists, especially those in the north it seems, tend to murder their victims, esp if they are children or those deemed on the lower rungs of society. Not saying we should start mopping those rapists left and right, but we sure do need a stronger deterrence",

Iska answer nahi Diya tumne?\n\nAlso, your opinion is still bevkoof. \n\nYou are trying to suggest that rapists who don't kill women they rape is because they are okay with life sentences and not okay with death penalty!\n\nMatlab wo soch Raha hai agar pakda Gaya to sirf life sentence hi to hoga! Lmao\n\nWouldn't he try to save his entire ass if he was actually being this analytical like you? Rape+murder to Indian rapist ko life sentence ke case me bhi karna chahiye ? Kyun? Ya usko pasand hai poori life jail me rehna? \n\nBevfook comment karte ho! \n\nTum actually me rape Kam karna chahte hi nahi ho! Problem ye hai!",
        "It's surprising that so many Indians defend rapists. Look at the downvotes on all of my comments.\n\nSome of these guys think they might do something like this in the future, so they can't be having tougher laws for rape in India. It's harsh but there's no explanation for them getting pissed off like this.",
        "Ever heard of DNA test ?",
        "Another reason I believe is that in a country like ours where there are some really poor people who have absolutely no rights. They are often falsely arrested on the crimes of others. If we enable death penalty then they get no chance to prove their innocence. Theyâ€™re simply selected at random, because many at time the rapists have too much power, and then executed.",

I have not misunderstood lol, you are just backing out now that you have seen the fault in your argument lol. \nIts fine atleast you see the fault lol. You could have taken example of simple death penalty carried by proper judicial systems in other countries would have been a better point but you had to go to saudi.....",

India: Life imprisonment to death sentence** After the Anti Rape Bill of April 2013, culprits are liable to life imprisonment (which is actually 14 years), imprisonment for entire life and even the death sentence in the rarest of rare cases. **2. China: Death sentence or castration** The sentence for rape in China is death. Castration is also used in some cases. **3. Saudi Arabia: Beheading within days** The punishment for rape in Saudi Arabia is a public beheading after administering the rapist with a sedative. **4. North Korea: Death by firing squad** North Korea sentences rapists to death by firing squad. **5. Afghanistan: Shot in the head or hanged to death** Rapists in Afghanistan are shot in the head within 4 days or hanged to death depending on the judgement handed out by the court. **6. Pakistan: Death sentence** Gang rape, child molestation and rape are punishable by death. An assault on a woman and intentional display of her body in public view is punishable by death in Pakistan. Statutory rape by a man of a girl under sixteen, especially a gang rape, is punishable by death. **7. Japan: 20 years to life** Twenty years for the crime of rape. If it is rape or fatal rape at the scene of any other crime like robbery, then death penalty. **8. Egypt: Death by hanging** Egypt is also one of the places that still follows the slightly outdated mode of death by hanging. **9. Iran: Hanged to death** Rapists in Iran are sentenced to death, sometimes by hanging but sometimes allegedly also by stoning. **10.

    "light_cleaned_comments": "All developed countries got rid of capital punishment read somewhere that it makes it worse as culprit is more likely to kill the victim so he doesn't get caught (as he would die if that happened). especially in a country like ours where justice system is so bad, ig it is more likely to backfire. Ah yes... Now what about the cases where the male gets ropd by a female or a male.... Tell me THAT. That is also molestation and a crime, bas you need to have courage to fight for justice. Rape of a man is also wrong. Saudi Arabia ðŸ’€ Whatâ€™s the question? There isnâ€™t one but Iâ€™d say Indians need to get whipped. Worked on the Chinese. The Indian people arenâ€™t cut out for democracy it feels like. I heard an argument that the reason we don't have \"death penalty\" for rape is that because law tends to look out for rape victims life . We have death penalty reserved for rape+murder(of the rape victim) , now if we change the law and put out death penalty for rape, so there's same penalty for rape and rape+ murder (of the rape victim) . Now after putting out this new law rapes won't stop in a single day, but then what will happen is that everytime there's a rape somewhere there's a sureshot chance(9/10) that the rape victim will be murdered by the offender. Because he'll be hanged for rape so he will not leave the victim alive to even testify , because now penalty for rape+murder(of the rape victim) is same as rape so , if he's climbing the noose he'll not leave the victim alive either. Now assuming there's a rape happening every hour across India, you are looking at a murder rate higher than a mountain. And all this is said in assumption that every rape case filed is not false. Actually making the punishment worse could be counter productive. If the sentence is death, the rapist is incentivised to kill the victim so that they don't report, if it's jail they might let the victim live. Also in the majority of cases, the rapist is someone the victim knows and trusts so they are less likely to report if the sentence is death. There are no stats with respect to India because they don't think men can be victims. Death penalty shouldnâ€™t be used solely for the reason that it is irreversible and we all know how erratic the justice system is and how many wrongfully convicted people are there. >1. India: ~~Life imprisonment to death sentence~~ Congratulating the perpetrators with garland and celebrating their achievements. Gendered whataboutism Malaysia - 8 to 30 years of prison and >10 (usually 20) strokes of whipping Mohak has uploaded a video regarding this issue on why giving a death sentence might be worse so why does this logic not apply to other countries who have a death penalty? always that one person fighting for \"humanism\". this post is simply mentioning rape punishments, where tf is it written that rapes happens ONLY with females? Doesn't have to be a death sentence. It could be increased to whipping. It tears their back so at least some justice and fear will be there. In my place sexual crimes get whippings along with prison time Maybe because those laws are set way before and has taken concrete form and now public abides by them, any \"new law\" takes time for public to actually follow it, if I were to ban alcohol today in a state which isn't a dry state, alcohol consumption won't drop down to zero just because it's illegal now. Only from certain community Exactly India needs to introduce whipping at least it gives some justice and creates fear instead of just prison Ask the government. They recently erased the law which was for rape against males or transgenders. That's right. That's why it doesn't have to be a death sentence. It could be increased to whipping. It tears their back so at least some justice and fear will be there. In my place sexual crimes get whippings along with prison time Yeah, I think the people are just too uncivilized to their core with this stuff to be trusted to solve this organically via the legal system. Maybe unless you add whipping to the mix. Donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s brute and medieval as heck, but it will instill the fear of God in the people. Because heâ€™s over smart. Ye nahi bolraha bandhu ke quick death penalty se rape cases kam hojayenge. But ulta samjha raha ke rape + murder hi honge. Lol India govt try to kare public execution of rapists ek baar. Tamasha banaye rapists ka. Ye sab rape apologists jo ladkiya chedte firte hain, didi didi bolenge sabko aur aankhen rakkhenge neechi . Sadly is desh me convicted rapists ke liye rallies nikalti hain demanding the rapists release ya govt khud release kardeti hai even in some of the most brutal rape cases in the country. Aur yahan ki majority janta rape apologists hi bane rehte hain. Dekhna kaise kilas gaye honge. Downvotes se samajh jaoge! India Saudi ko copy karraha hai religious domination me for Hinduism. We should also copy how they are handling rapists but koi nahi chahta aisa ho India. Sabse sad part to yehi hai India ka. Rapists ko itna bura nahi samajhte yahan. Tumne bahot befkoofi ki baat likhi hai yahan pe. Tum rape kam karna chahte bhi ho? Should be 20 strokes every day. Plus extra whipping everytime the victim wants to give Tumhare kehne ka matlab hai presently Indian rapists apne victim ko zinda isliye chodta hai taaki usko sirf life sentence ho and death penalty nahi? Agar dimaag laga hi rahe ho to thoda aur lagao. Donâ€™t you think agar rapist itna sochta hai to victim ko hamesha marega regardless of death penalty or life imprisonment? Usko maza to ayega nahi life imprisonment leke. Wo to bahar hi rehna chahega. Matlab kuch bhi copied logic forward karte rehte ho tum log! W saudi arabia Death penalty as a way to prevent rape is like putting a band aid on a cracked wall. Doesn't do shit, and would encourage rapists to murder their victims so they can get away with it And if death sentence is given for rape, then rape+murder cases will increase It does apply. Stop being emotional and apply sense. Bohot baat rapists ko extra judicially mara Gaya hai. Hua rape Kam ? Public execution vaise bhi nahin ho sakta chahe kitna serious crime ho. People praising saudi arabia..... you also wanna consider how are women treated there? I can confidently say its just as bad if not worse than india rn. Changing the laws wont do shit if society wont change. Yes rata rataya dialogue this one, but this is the actual solution. Yes I honestly dont want ki hamari society Saudi jasi barbaric ho jaye. You wanna know how \"good\" situation of women in these Saudi countries is? Come on dont be this negligent. There is a reason Legal systems are there. Solution is to make them better along with changing mindset of society, not to evolve even more backwards as society. you forgot to mention that victims will also be punished in some arab countries. India - accused to marry victim if crime proved. I agree fully, itâ€™s cowardly to formulate your laws out of fear and cowardice of what a rapist may decide to do. Like, the law should be based on the criminal? Iâ€™d add whipping to the mix too. Itâ€™s medieval and brutal but the only thing that can civilize the Indian people. >Actually making the punishment worse could be counter productive. Lol, what is this logic you guys spout here? Nonsense. By your own logic, lightening the punishment should decrease rape cases? Should that be the strategy then? These people just get hyper when something happens for a week or two then get back to their nonsensical talking points. Thatâ€™s why this problem has never been fixed in india. You've listed some interesting countries, do you know their threshold of evidence? Please share what proof a woman needs to provide to prove rape? And that she can be legally sentenced to lashings or stoning when such a case isn't proved. As for USA, you've literally not followed the culture of rape on college campuses and the lack of any kind of punishment. You can have the strictest of laws on the book, but if they can't be consistently and fairly applied, they're useless. India has reasonable laws to punish culprits, the problem is that these aren't property enforced. Plenty of rapists, especially those in the north it seems, tend to murder their victims, esp if they are children or those deemed on the lower rungs of society. Not saying we should start mopping those rapists left and right, but we sure do need a stronger deterrence honestly i have only seen non saudis complain about women treatment and actually never a saudi women complain about how she is treated in her country also castrate them Just because you can't understand doesn't mean it doesn't make sense. I gave an explanation for why it doesn't work. Now if you disagree, provide an actual argument. Rate won't decrease, rate of reporting will increase. They require 1 male witness or 2 women witnesses, the victim isn't able to find them in most cases Women who move out do. They can't speak out when they're there. I tried giving you a gold but the app wonâ€™t let me. I just wanna say, real astute analysis on the situation in India. So correct, people like dry and moan for a week, make Reddit posts then all energy gone. Your analysis is justâ€¦ on-point, man. Don't pretend to misunderstand what I am trying to say. We must give a quick death penalty to the rapists. Who's saying ke women oppression Karo India me unki tarah? Jo kehraha hun utna samjho. Tum rape Kam karna bhi chahte ho? Iska answer nahi Diya tumne? Also, your opinion is still bevkoof. You are trying to suggest that rapists who don't kill women they rape is because they are okay with life sentences and not okay with death penalty! Matlab wo soch Raha hai agar pakda Gaya to sirf life sentence hi to hoga! Lmao Wouldn't he try to save his entire ass if he was actually being this analytical like you? Rape+murder to Indian rapist ko life sentence ke case me bhi karna chahiye ? Kyun? Ya usko pasand hai poori life jail me rehna? Bevfook comment karte ho! Tum actually me rape Kam karna chahte hi nahi ho! Problem ye hai! It's surprising that so many Indians defend rapists. Look at the downvotes on all of my comments. Some of these guys think they might do something like this in the future, so they can't be having tougher laws for rape in India. It's harsh but there's no explanation for them getting pissed off like this. Ever heard of DNA test ? Another reason I believe is that in a country like ours where there are some really poor people who have absolutely no rights. They are often falsely arrested on the crimes of others. If we enable death penalty then they get no chance to prove their innocence. Theyâ€™re simply selected at random, because many at time the rapists have too much power, and then executed. And they don't always leave DNA behind The most irrelevant post ever. Wow so lovely! There are probably other method to catch the rapist, such as pregnancy can also be used as evidence but DNA testing are extremely accurate but anyways Rape cases in Saudia arabia is extremely low They don't always leave DNA behind. Also they need 2 female witnesses or 1 male witness Again Witnesses are not always necessary if there are evidences provided And they don't always leave other evidence They go full medieval on rapist's ass No mercy ðŸ’€ You clearly said \" how they handle rapists \". And how saudi handles rapist is public stoning by what posts say. I have not misunderstood lol, you are just backing out now that you have seen the fault in your argument lol. Its fine atleast you see the fault lol. You could have taken example of simple death penalty carried by proper judicial systems in other countries would have been a better point but you had to go to saudi..... Because rapists deserve the worst kind of death. If you know any country that gives worse punishment to the rapists, I will gladly take their name. It is interesting that you are arguing for rapists here, trying to suggest that they should not be given brutal death. Are you guilty yourself? Seems like it. Yup because death penalty to hai hi , ab murder karke Pakde jaane ke chances Kam karne ki sochega rapist . People asking Death penalty within days ? Are bhai Fake cases walon ko bhi marwa doge kya ... Bhit baar ex gf rape case kardeti hai on promise of marriage wala ... Bhot baar extortion Wale mamle hai , bhot baar police Galt bande ko pakad leti hai because real culprit is powerful and he bribed Police . Kuch bhi ho sakata hai . Also jab rape par death milni hi hai to kyun na rapist murder kardega jisse pakde jane ke chances Kam ho Jaye. ? Death sentence se rape Kam nahi hoga, rape+murder ke cases badhege. Rapist will kill the victim if the sentence is same for rape and rape+murder. To reduce rape, men must be taught to not rape. Itâ€™s a stupid argument from rapist apologists. You guys donâ€™t want to reduce rape. Only the harshest of punishments can reduce the incidence of rape. Deny it because agar apply hogaye aise laws to potential rapists Jo ki bhare pade hain is country me, unki haalat tight hojayegi. And induction into politics And in Japan and SK, if a guy rapes someone while being drunk, it's the fault of alcohol, not the guy. Public execution is never an option in any civilized countries. Jin countries ka naam loge wo sb kisi na kisi situation mein extreme hai bilkul. Hum proper democracy hain. Humare yahan ye sb kbhi nhi hone wala. Infact, it doesn't happen in any civilized country USA ko hi dekh lo unka judicial system one of the best hai. Death penalty kr skte h but pta nhi usse kitna asar hoga. Iss situation ko handle krne ka sbse bada tareeka hota h conviction rate improve krna..mass campaigns chlate rehna...aur vigilance systems ko strengthen krna"
