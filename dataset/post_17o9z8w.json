This time, a case has been registered against the Bigg Boss OTT 2 winner, after a rave party raid on 2 November. The popular YouTuber allegedly peddled snake venom to such parties.\n\n>This comes two years after he roasted Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan when he was arrested in association with drugs and a rave. In the video, Yadav repeatedly stresses on how ‘illegal’ acts should be punished. If not karma, irony definitely keeps a ledger.",
