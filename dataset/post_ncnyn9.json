Spolier alert - Central characters who's a lesbian (bi incase of web series) does not end up with her\"r because she has to take care of \"him\". Come on its 2021, can't we have a better storyline with lesbian characters. \n\nAlso on the other note i watched Radhe. Now i am taking break from watching movies.",
