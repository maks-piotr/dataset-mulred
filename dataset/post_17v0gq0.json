Itâ€™s also usually men and their families treating the woman as a retirement scheme by harassing her family for lakhs/crores in dowry. \n\nBut oh no, a country globally known for being extremely misogynistic and patriarchal is so hard to live in for a man!",

So, women are always treated as a victim of adultery regardless of who initiated the relationship. \n\nCourts have already established that adultery or occasional bouts of infidelity by wife is not a basis for denial of maintenance.
