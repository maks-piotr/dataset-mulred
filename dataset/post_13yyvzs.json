        "Yes. That's what I was thinking. Doesn't kerala has the highest amount educated people? Then why is the crime so high?",
        "I feel it's because crimes are reported more and the comparatively low population skew the data a bit more, nonetheless very interesting",
        "source : https://www.adda247.com/pa/jobs/highest-crime-rate-in-india/",
        "It is the number of crimes reported, not the number of crimes happened.",
        "Because crime rates are calculated by crimes that are reported. A higher crime rate is a proxy for faith in law enforcement. A higher crime rate means that the police is actually filing FIRs and taking cognisance. In places like UP police will only come and intimidate you into not filing a case because it‚Äôs either too difficult to work or the accused is some local goon.",
        "Probably because kerala has educated people so they have awareness and report the crimes unlike other states who let it go?",
        "Because crime is very easily reported here. I have lived in the north and the south. Try filing a property dispute complaint at a Police Thana in Etawah or a rape case against an influential politician's son even in a tier 2 town like Jabalpur. If you can get that done as a poor person without paying money, I'll eat my words. \n\n\nBoth in TN and Kerala, I've had no problems giving a FIR for incodents, I would have normally been told to settle with money. TN did have a few hiccups when it came to political people, but Kerala Police has to be hands down the best that I've interacted with in India. Mumbai comes a close second (Not a state, I know, but they're better than cops you'll see elsewhere in Maharashtra) and then cops in TN.",
        "Since in Kerala actual FIRs get filed without the SC/HC breathing down on the police. The police actually do their job - lol. Which cannot be said about certain other states.",

        "3000 ..",
        "Exactly! Violent crime is a better indicator IMO. \n\nLike you said, petty crime is reported more often in states like Kerala and TN, whereas the police/people in places like UP and Bihar skew towards reporting violent crime only.\n\nIf you look at the violent crime rate, then states like Kerala, TN and Gujarat are not in the top ranks.

        "For the same reason Sweden has a higher rape rate than South Africa or India. Because their institutions work well enough that crimes are reported.",
        "Thats just an assumption. A higher crime rate doesnt mean the police are doing their job or not lmao, you need the missing denominator which is the number of crimes which actually occurred. Kerala is wild and vile place, and higher crime rate means exactly that‚Ä¶that there are more crimes happening in Kerala, you need more info to make stupid assumptions like ‚Äúwhats reported, whats not reported‚Äù. You cant know about this sitting at home browsing reddit. If you go by general view, then its subjective and changes from each person‚Äôs perspective for eg for most theres zero evidence to claim that delhi crimes aren‚Äôt reported, and theres massive evidence to claim that Kerala is a crime pit.

And yes that is indeed correlated to crime. And you talked about people in Kerala moving outside there to study or work. You are seriously saying that while comparing to Bihar? Bihar is one of the states with the most number of migrant workers out there. And lakhs come to Kerala for work from Bihar.

It rather means that a large number of crimes are getting registered in Kerala. It means that people have trust in police, law and order.\n\nThe people in Kerala are more educated and empowered. As a result, most of the incidents get reported. I've seen many people seeking police -intervention in issues that will never be reported anywhere else in India.\n\nIn most states of India, police themselves refuse to register crimes so as to keep the number of crime rates low. But in Kerala, it is the direct opposite, here even the smallest cases are encouraged to be reported and registered.\n\nThe Kerala police DGP himself has made it clear that the high crime rate is not a matter of concern, but is encouraging since it shows the strength and effectiveness of Kerala police.\n\nKerala police is one of the most people-friendly police forces in our country.

    "light_cleaned_title": "Highest crime rate in India state-wise (2022)",
    "light_cleaned_selftext": "I had this image that UP would be at the top, but the crime rates have dropped significantly, why do you think gujarat and kerala have such high crime rates?",
    "light_cleaned_comments": "kerala with highest crime rate and literacy rate lol Yes. That's what I was thinking. Doesn't kerala has the highest amount educated people? Then why is the crime so high? I feel it's because crimes are reported more and the comparatively low population skew the data a bit more, nonetheless very interesting source : It is the number of crimes reported, not the number of crimes happened. Because crime rates are calculated by crimes that are reported. A higher crime rate is a proxy for faith in law enforcement. A higher crime rate means that the police is actually filing FIRs and taking cognisance. In places like UP police will only come and intimidate you into not filing a case because it‚Äôs either too difficult to work or the accused is some local goon. Probably because kerala has educated people so they have awareness and report the crimes unlike other states who let it go? Because crime is very easily reported here. I have lived in the north and the south. Try filing a property dispute complaint at a Police Thana in Etawah or a rape case against an influential politician's son even in a tier 2 town like Jabalpur. If you can get that done as a poor person without paying money, I'll eat my words. Both in TN and Kerala, I've had no problems giving a FIR for incodents, I would have normally been told to settle with money. TN did have a few hiccups when it came to political people, but Kerala Police has to be hands down the best that I've interacted with in India. Mumbai comes a close second (Not a state, I know, but they're better than cops you'll see elsewhere in Maharashtra) and then cops in TN. Since in Kerala actual FIRs get filed without the SC/HC breathing down on the police. The police actually do their job - lol. Which cannot be said about certain other states. There's no way UP'S crime rate is at 262 .4 You can imagine the difficulty in getting an FIR filed in Delhi. It needs SC level action ( and still takes weeks). This goes to many states. Our police are way more civil than their counterparts in many other states. Example How much is it? Bin Diesel se pooch ,woh log timepass khe liye murder aur rape khelte hein Par mene toh aapse puchha bhaiya ji. Aapko pta hai? Reported 3000 .. Exactly! Violent crime is a better indicator IMO. Like you said, petty crime is reported more often in states like Kerala and TN, whereas the police/people in places like UP and Bihar skew towards reporting violent crime only. If you look at the violent crime rate, then states like Kerala, TN and Gujarat are not in the top ranks. States like Assam and WB are at the top instead. Source: Why? Because I shared some statistics? I think police in general are more approachable as well He means \"Reported\" crime stats lol Kerala is again at the top. Never disappoints. Kisi index mein nahin aata. Telengana and Andhra have a crime rate of 420 ![gif](giphy|5xjbWDIgEZSgM) Source bhi dedo bhaiyaa ji Not me searching for Delhi. Arey Bihar where? Reporting of crime is too in Kerala. We don‚Äôt need an SC order for the police to file an FIR. Try your luck in places such as Unnao and see for yourself. Arey bhai UP KA size bhi to dekho dimaag ghutne mein hai? If only the police in kerela would have done their job , the conversions and brainwashing of Kerala youth wouldn't be so high ,lol. They very well known how proactive radical islamic org. are active all across Kerala but still don't do shit about it. Huge difference between crime and violent crimes. At 0.9 per lakh Kerala has the lowest murder rate. Reported vs unreported UP etc are like the darkweb 4rth largest state sir. Reported crime Is crime the rate the number of times a person is a victim of a crime, per capita of population? Because then UPs number makes sense. population ki baat kr rahe hai shayad According to this, every state barring Kerala, Gujarat & Tamil Nadu have crime rates lower than Norway. Lol. Make of that what you will. 1. If this is true then one of the reason might be Migration of Labour to the first 3 ranked states. 2. Or the data is skewed. UP is the King of Crimes. India vs rest of the world on crime - According to others here. This is reported crime stats and as kerala has high literacy rate and a easier process to report crime the crime rate is high as in states like UP people just let go. Apart from that this is not violent crime stats in which kerala's ranking is quite low. Difficulty in getting fir filed..? Idk about that you can do it online and go to police for follow i might be wrong tho Tab to aur bhi hona chahiye tha. According to others crimes here are not reported much because of SC and most of the time people just let go or don't have knowledge on how to report them. But i don't think the 4 South States would be that far apart in terms of recorded crimes... aye Punjab lowest I think you‚Äôre right. There are crimes other than violent ones. Where the fuck is Delhi üôÑ ROFL ü§£ü§£ I guess this is based on the number of FIRs filed & not the number of actual crime happened Yes this is reported crimes and not unreported A complaint is not the same as an FIR. That explains Kerala and TN. How to explain Gujarat. It is neither literate nor highly educated. Also it has questionable law and order situation. These are exactly the kind of dressed up stats that UP needs to project in the next election. This is such BS. In Karnataka every single autowala is a goonda. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs so normalised that nobody reports these things. Kerala and Gujarat on the other hand have been much safer in my experience. They have saying in Kerala - No slap goes unreported in Kerala. And it's true, you'll never find it difficult there to lodge a complaint even for the smallest of things. There was a satyamev jayate episode on kerala's police reforms which makes the process of filling a complaint easy and incentives police to actually register a complaint (which then get logged in national crimes data). Whaaat? UP is one of the lowest? Whoever compiled this data clearly is living under the rock. This guy needs to change his unit of measurement. Those who are only pointing to the stats and those who are completely discounting the stats just stop. Truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. Also do not forget this stat is per capita based and the population of the states differ a lot. Sbut i do think there is major under reporting in UP Bihar and to some extent Punjab The police registers an FIR, you file a complaint. Stats show only the number of FIRs filed, not complaints made. It's so ironic how people like you talk about brainwashing. Delhi in the mud smh This only covers two types of theft then? That's crime being reported and the number of FIR filed. Kerala police doesn't require the supreme court to yell in order for the FIR to be logged. &#x200B; ![gif](giphy|ZB6ShdcXgFjrRv0DHe) The Kerala Police do their duty and know their jobs. Can't say the same about your teachers though - you wouldn't have turned out an idiot who falls for every propaganda, and also would have known the spelling of Kerala - if they knew how to do theirs. It is per one lakh population. Does it not mean UP has objectively as many reported crimes as Gujarat for example where the population is 1/5th ? It's the reported cases. Title is totally misleading, old school Godi Media tactic. I wouldn't trust any crime related statistics coming from India. People just don't report crimes. If someone finds courage to report crime, then police won't always co-operate. I think lot of domestic violence cases simply don't get registered because _ghar ka mamla_. Many rape cases don't even get reported because _khandan ki izzat_. Dowry won't get reported because it is given \"willingly\" . For the same reason Sweden has a higher rape rate than South Africa or India. Because their institutions work well enough that crimes are reported. Thats just an assumption. A higher crime rate doesnt mean the police are doing their job or not lmao, you need the missing denominator which is the number of crimes which actually occurred. Kerala is wild and vile place, and higher crime rate means exactly that‚Ä¶that there are more crimes happening in Kerala, you need more info to make stupid assumptions like ‚Äúwhats reported, whats not reported‚Äù. You cant know about this sitting at home browsing reddit. If you go by general view, then its subjective and changes from each person‚Äôs perspective for eg for most theres zero evidence to claim that delhi crimes aren‚Äôt reported, and theres massive evidence to claim that Kerala is a crime pit. I can clearly see why Kerala and Gujarat can top the list without any biases. Please read the first comment. Came looking for this. Was not disappointed üòÅ What's the source? Trust me bro? Wdym? UP is considerably safer than kerala in majority of safety indicators, maybe not as much as Bihar tho. Theres no saying as such in kerala. I wanted to add the source but reddit is not allowing me to edit the post however i have posted the link as reply for the first comment by autoMod. Crime report rate* \\*West Bengal has been wiped from existence\\* Source. Where did you get this data from ? No, You're wrong. I'm someone who has his fair share of complaints about Kerala but Kerala is nowhere near the least safe state in India. There's no reason why Kerala which has a high quality of life and a well educated population is more dangerous than UP, Bihar etc. Do you know what kind of literates do the literacy reporting system covers? Its so basic you‚Äôll laugh your off. Its got nothing to do with filing a police complaint or an FIR. Even a dumb person who knows nothing can and often do go to file an FIR or police complaints. UP may not be as big a hub of the kind of crimes which Kerala might be a hub of. You can‚Äôt assume rest because you dont know or dont like the data presented. See the reply on autoMod. Crime statistics are stupid. Vsauce 2 has a great video on it Lol , Everyone knows I.P is the crime Capital of India. Lots of Crimes don't even get Registered forget about even Investigation. Tf there is vsauce2? Man i love watching vsauce videos. Whatever helps you sleep at night bro. Punjabis don't need to file complaints, we sort out things peacefully at our motors. Try filing an fir many times police try to settle the matter in police station itself . They even take a lot of time to file fir Intresting, the media would like you to belive that the communist and BJP are cutting each other's throat every single day just visit both states. you will get mugged murdered and shot in kerala if you walk after 7pm even in cities. whereas you can easily walk around in remote rural in UP at 2am. even women in shorts. it's very safe. Stole the crime rate üò¢ Population is a big factor, up has 7 times the the population of that of kerela so the rate gradually drops down. A very large population of UP is pretty safe , it's generally the notorious places like NCR regions including a few other that contributes to the majority of violent crimes Your fair share of complaints with kerala has nothing to do with actual crimes being committed in that state. It is what it is. Your belief about particular correlation between high literacy rate and being dangerous doesnt make it true in the real world. Also, you‚Äôre blatantly wrong, kerala has a higher literacy rate but they arent well educated, UP and Bihar have lower literacy rate but they are better educated than people of kerala. Same for West Bengal. üòÇüòÇüòÇ As a Bihari. Not bad at all. Maybe in kerala. True, highlighted an influential factor. I found this on the official NCRB website. [https://ncrb.gov.in/en/Crime-in-India-2021](https://ncrb.gov.in/en/Crime-in-India-2021) And the figures for UP are very different in the govt site. Take a look The latest report shows only till 2021 Have you ever gone to police station in a up town?? Try going there the data is of 2019- 2021 I have shared the source as reply in autoMod comment. The stats are cummulative for 2019 -2021 whereas i have shown only for 2022 Like another comment states if you follow this graph than barring top 3-4 states, the rest of the states have less crime rate than Norway. We can go and compare it with other nations too, what do you think then? No, but i know some people there who got into some street road rage situation(in a city they dont stay in), filing of fir was a breeze. Ofc some times police will ask you to fix it yourself with the other party wherever possible. brainwashed BJP andhbhakts don't go around blowing themselves in sleeper cells all around the world, lol. Show data first. Change the title to \"top states where people trust their police more\" These stats need to be taken with a grain of salt because many crimes go unreported in areas where there's less development. Another comment said that if you consider these stats, Norway would have a higher crime rate than most of these states. Do you think that's possible? \"kerala has a higher literacy rate but they arent well educated\" How? Do you mean in terms of college literacy? In what sense are UP, Bihar and WB's population more educated? Now compare with this. Murders are not easy to hide. Bro this is NATIONAL CRIME RECORDS BUREAU. Their latest data is till 2021, how can Adda24/7 get data for 2022 if the govt has not even updated. If you're a banking aspirant or any Govt job aspirant it's always recommended to take data only from the govt sites . Did you pull these facts out of your ass? I'm always amazed by hate mongering morons like you. Pull up one piece of evidence that shows people from UP and Bihar being more educated than the people of kerala. Definitely. This truly shows where crimes are really high. I am still shocked to see why UP has such low murders , probably because they are never reported. Hahahaha i wish i could This is a classic example of survivorship bias. Only those states with effective policing can keep accurate reports of crimes over states that have less control over their forces. Real [Norway Crime Rate 2020](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/NOR/norway/crime-rate-statistics) Dravida model roxxxx UP has low crime rate are you kidding me? I didnt say more, i said better educated, the people who do pursue higher education in UP & Bihar tend to do significantly better than their counterparts in Kerala. But Kerala has higher basic literate people who can read and write. You dont have the best thinkers/engineers/accountants/civil servants in kerala, but the ones who do pursue it in UP or Bihar tend to do well in their fields. You‚Äôre the one claiming personal views to be facts/stats not me. UP üå† I didn't claim anything buddy. You were replying to someone else's comment. Now prove your claim. Any stats to show how Malayalis are less educated than the people of UP and Bihar? I'm glad you don't think personal views are not facts. In pune, autowalas made the govt ban bike online service like uber bikes, rapido, etc. Here, even rapido has autos only. No bike service is available in Pune at all. If this is not gundaraj, I don't know what else is... And whats the denominator in the data OP posted? No sane guy would believe these stats as in many states crimes won't even knock to the records. I didnt say less i said better educated. Mallus are more literate than Biharis and UP people. Know what? Here's an alternate title for the table - States with highest reported crime rates in India. In a world were people get burned alive for reporting a crime, it's obvious that the crime rate will be extremely low. Yeah going by these lists I'd say higher crime rates is actually a better thing since they are at least getting reported. \"Reported Crimes\" . We know from recent events the difficulty Delhi police have filing FIR... Same would go for UP. Having lived in Blr, low KA rates aren't exactly a surprise. Some of the worst police in the country. or simply, \"its work\". For example, no mobile is ever \"stolen\", its always \"lost\". Oh... Telangana and Andra too? Huh? Why is Gujarat so high on this list? I always thought Gujarat was much safer than the rest of India. One of the most common \"crimes\" seen in newspapers are alcohol related, so that may be one reason. But otherwise, I am genuinely confused. I'll agree with that somewhat. Kerala lacks good colleges so higher education standards are lower. But basic literacy is still an important thing and Kerala is the best at that. There are no other metrics to corroborate why Kerala is more unsafe than UP, Bihar or WB other than Crime rate which makes the stats suspicious. If Kerala is as lawless as you claim, the stats other than the crime rate should back it up, right? Things like murder rate, homicide etc People in kerala and TN have a lot more faith in their governments than other southern states and much more than in rest of India. Honestly as someone from KA I was astonished and so in awe of kerala govt compared to ours. The differences were so immediately noticeable, just from a short few weeks visit. I hear there are some wrestlers who may disagree with you [Satyamev jayate Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9J12dUxuVQ) shows a lot about the condition of the police in India. In this the crime rate data is explained beautifully well! Even outside of Bangalore? Kerala me sarkar nahi hai na Bhai chutiyo ki Kaisi baat kar Raha hai. Fir has been lodged... huh what you talking about?got one filed yesterday with ease No you look at violent crimes because people are more likely to report it and/or it's harder to go unnoticed. So in parts of the world where government is shit, you look at violent crime rate as an indicator of the actual crime rate. Since most places that have a high violent crime rate will also have a high non-violent crime rate, you can infer the general crime rate. So since UP violent crime rate is much higher than keralas, you can infer that UP also probably has a very high non-violent crime rate, but it just goes unreported. As a right winger would say, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe in all these numbers.‚Äù UP and Kar crime rates are a joke. Yea sure Define \"crime\" - data theft and murder are two very different types of crime Both left and right wing fav states are leading. After SC got involved. When I was in school, we friends went to nearby police station and complained that private buses are not giving student ticket(ST) & doesn‚Äôt stop when only students are at the bus stop. The police took the case, asked us to sign, had some chill chat with us and next day warned the bus guys. Then we became friends with the bus guys over this issue as well. This is more like an appreciation post for the top states. UP nd Bihar laughing in the corner Source: Trust me bro I think people in Bihar have stopped reporting crimes Nobody in their right mind would believe these statistics..police avoid filing FIRs as much as they can..I‚Äôve been pickpocketed, got stuff stolen from my home, been a victim of hit and run and police never filed any report‚Ä¶when I was pickpocketed in Noida in metro, police asked me to use Delhi police online report system to file complaint and refused to file FIR. When someone stole my laptop, phone and wallet from my house which was directly in front of a police station in Noida, they just blamed me for not locking my stuff in cupboard even though I locked the house door. Again, no report. Hey, i agree, and I actually dont even know what kind of universities kerala has or if they are good or bad. I just never ever see anyone going from other states to kerala for education, or even business. I also dont ever see mallu names come up often in higher echelons of other fields like engineering/accountancy/company secretaries/civil services, etc etc. but i have seen plenty of names from Bihar and some from UP in the top end of these fields. Although i will definitely say that to be able to show their skills, they usually move out of Bihar and UP so there is that.. again, i am sure mallus would be occupying a higher share of top brass of some fields but I personally do not know. Also, about the crimes, i do believe Biharis in particular lead simpler lives(but i have no way to prove this, how can i prove this? Its just what i have seen when i stayed in Bhagalpur for some project for a few years).There would be petty crimes and maybe some arent getting reported but its honestly quite believable for me that Bihar has low crime rate. Theres definitely some patriarchy there but that is not a crime. Theres also a very very strict alcohol ban across whole of Bihar in case you didnt know and theres no drug culture there like the metros across India. No way am I believing this. Man , I don‚Äôt know in which universe you‚Äôre living in but UP has one of the highest murder rate in the country whereas kerela has the lowest. [source](https://www.deshabhimani.com/english/news/kerala/kerala-has-lowest-murder-rate-in-the-country-0-08-uttar-pradesh-deadliest-at-15-1/1145) A big confounder in these numbers is crime reportage and ability to file an FIR. A better educated population and a government inclined towards law an order will show higher numbers. Case in point Kerala having higher numbers than UP Yup, just wanna quote this report from NCB that states murder rate has increased in UP [source](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/crime_in_india_table_additional_table_chapter_reports/Chapter%203_2011.pdf) Reported* But murder is just 1 of the crimes. Looking at the population of UP, the murders in UP arent all that high at all, because as per your data its total percentage of murders, not out of per 10000 or a lakh. It may seem counter intuitive But this is again a testament to the high literacy rate in south Why can't I find Bihar in the list? There are two factors that have not been taken into account here 1. Percentage of crimes being reported 2. Percentage of FIR filed for the reported cases. There are official stats for this factor where many states have very low percentage of FIR to cases reported Ôªø Goa? too small? No wonder Karnataka is low. Cops here will jump into a lake before they register a case. Bingo. Cops here won't register a case unless they can make money on it And then what has happened? This seems wrong. Bihar for sure would be on top, and Bhar isnt even in the list! OP source to dal wow. Back when I was in school, here in delhi, the private buses used to just mow people down. I'm not in support of him this discussion was about fir... In states like UP, crimes are not even registered. Police are afraid to book cases and there is political pressure at all levels. Remember - if you don't do any COVID test, the number of COVID cases will be 0 in the books. That doesn't mean in reality there are no COVID cases What‚Äôre you talking about. It‚Äôs very easy to find evidence. Just look into incidence of violent crimes to find out what‚Äôs happening - (Page 12) If you think someone getting arrested for creating a ruckus in a bar somewhere or protesting and trespassing is similar to someone pulling out a gun and shooting you, I have a bridge to sell you. Lol. These are reported crime rate. For which FIRs are filed. Getting police to file an FIR is a challenge in itself in north. Remember Supreme court had to step in to ask delhi police to file a FIR in athletes case. That case would not have made it to this report until the FIR. Bcoz in places like UP, crimes aren't reported. If people go to the police station to report a crime they are punished further üëá yogi ji supremacy There's also Vsauce 3 In Bangalore, auto guys want rapido to be banned. But that hasn't happened. So they have taken things in their own hands - whenever they see a rapido driver, they simply physically thrash him. That's gundaraj++ And government actually does not want FIRs to registered. Reflects badly on them. ü§∑ Your share of experience in Bihar has nothing to do with the actual amount of crimes being committed there. It is what it is. And you are comparing a few top accomplished people at the top of entrance exams and fields to generalise the whole population which is not even completely literate? I mean why are you taking a round about way to use that number as a metric when literacy would be more generalised to the population. Since basic education is a human right? And yes that is indeed correlated to crime. And you talked about people in Kerala moving outside there to study or work. You are seriously saying that while comparing to Bihar? Bihar is one of the states with the most number of migrant workers out there. And lakhs come to Kerala for work from Bihar. And Bihar also has the one of the highest number of migrant workers going into UAE. So it's not just Kerala that has migrant workers. \"peacefully\" These are reported crimes. Most cases go unreported Yes, very peacefully indeed. These means the top j the list state are honestly reporting all the cases and registering their FIR‚Ä¶.. This means police is doing good job in Kerala and Gujrat‚Ä¶ And the police is not registering it. I checked your source, and thats still not an evidence showing crimes are underreported in Bihar or UP or Delhi. It just states that the out of total crimes, violent crimes were of a higher percentages in Delhi or UP or Bihar than in kochi or kerala, or even higher as a total, but i never disputed this. You‚Äôre proving a different and unrelated point. Also on the contrary, its hypocritical and stupid of you to assume they are not being reported in Delhi, UP or Bihar if we are to believe your data here. You‚Äôll only use/refer data you trust personally right? These are due to State police of these states are honest and reporting more cases and filing FIRs‚Ä¶ it is actually different perspective Can you elaborate? Exactly XD Try walking solo at night in each of states and report back Thats precisely my point. Many underdeveloped states are having significant cases go unreported. Students pays concession rates and takes upto 90% of the morning and evening trips which is a big loss for the bus. So they usually skips the college, school busstops. Which is referred here. People don't report crimes because their faith in law and order system is shaken by looking at things like wrestlers protest I doubt this represents correct data. I'm pretty sure private and public buses in kerala mow the most people. Those fuckers drive on the edge of what the bus is capable of. What am I reading here? What‚Äôs crime rate? No of MLAs? But an FIR is an FIR. Law capital Dilli is notorious for spurious FIRs rather than unreported crime. UP's rate is way higher than expected. Wow Check reply on autoMod. For some reason I cannot edit the post Your source is about 2007-2011 sir i'd rather be murdered in Kerala than UP Pardon? The OP post says MP has 560 cases per lakh population, Norway has ~570 per 100k. No - they merely drive into mosques and threaten to shoot people in other countries and get arrested. [Norway Crime Rate Stats 2020](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/NOR/norway/crime-rate-statistics) As per this Norway has 570 reported cases per lakh population. Now either MP is safer than Norway or Norway has better rate of crimes being reported A kid who is studying Jeeneet. Thinks at this stage he knows all about the world - while he is deeply miserable, underconfident and thinks he is an idiot, very low self value, no social life. And hates anyone who isn't exactly like him, that's how little scientific temperament he has. That's how low IQ he is. And he talks about brainwashing. I suspect the only reason Kerala is at the top of the list is because they actually bother to report crimes accurately and regularly. Same reason why the was seemingly more COVID-19 cases in Kerala than in northern states These numbers don't mean much in isolation. As is often the case with social studies, if the calculation is not transparent l, you gotta look at the experimental method. Often times only thing these numbers represent is how the study was conducted. Kay, and whys that unbelievable for you? Its a state vs a country. You really believe the rosy picture of the scandinavian land it seems. Mowing had reduced a lot since my college days. Is it still a thing in Kerela I'm just surprised that one could think to approach the police about it. In Delhi we just beat up the driver, set a bus on fire maybe. Wut? Lol. Thank God . We have mostly sane people in our state. .. Where TF is Delhi ? Doesnt happen much now, I imagine. But college kids beating drivers, burning buses was a thing back in the day. Oh. Our master Aryan, how are thou? Had your gober meal and gaumutra drink today? Yes, and I'll be passing it in about 15 minutes so you won't have to wait too long for lunch. Yeah they just kill unborn babies, and celebrate rapists. Stfu.. More literacy , more crime ? Crime reporting in India ü§è...the states showing higher rate may actually have better institutional trust Reporting the crimes to the police. This... Seems oddü§î This. Kerala still safer than most places in Africa Reported vs Reality If I remember correctly, most of the crimes in Kerala are under the category of rash driving. This is the source for 2021 [https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/CII-2021/CII\\_2021Volume%201.pdf](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/CII-2021/CII_2021Volume%201.pdf). If you look at page 52 and 53, you can see that Kerala has a disproportionately high rate for offenses related to driving while crime rates for other categories are low. Is bihar off the chart?? > significant cases go unreported police does not file FIR for nonsignificant cases either. Once dads mobile was lost and we had to wait an entire day in police station to get the fir filed.They were so stubborn India meri jaan bruh I‚Äôm proud of you punjab. That's not helping your case. That's two very specific kinds of theft covered. I guess the topic should be \"Highest **reported** crime rate in India state-wise (2022)\" What UP doing so low you telling me UP as low crime rate than kerela? Lol, clearly fake data. What's the source of this info? Source in reply on autoMod See the reply in comment from autoMod In no world TN>UP regarding crimes. That‚Äôs like 2+2=5 Got it Well should we compare it with other countries which are considered safe? Crimes reported rates* Hi please read the top comment you will know why. It's good seeing Kashmir having a low murder rate, it's quite contradictory to whatever the far-right is spewing. Beside the sudden jump in 2020, Iceland (one of the safest countries in the world) had the crime rate of approx 300 reported cases per 100k people but as per OP article and you, UP is much more safer.l with less than 300 crimes recorded per 1 lac population. Note: The crime rate has varied in the last decade within 300-900 per 100k people. Sure, I believe this stat, because my state Bihar is not even in the list and we all know how much awesome our policing here is /s You mean the police will always not co-operate. FTFY. /s lagana bhul gaya shayad How come UP and punjab is lower Punjab is the drug capital of India. It being at the bottom is different üòÇ ok How do you track this when government only issues 2/3 of the death certificates And only 25% has a cause of death? Lol UP , this is amazing. Propaganda at its best Ye lo ye sarkari report h I did the same. We were not given st, made to get off bus. Talked to the police the same day and wrote on a paper the complaint. Never had to worry about st again. I have never felt threatened by the police in Kerala and have always been really helpful > Thats just an assumption. A higher crime rate doesnt mean the police are doing their job or not lmao, you need the missing denominator which is the number of crimes which actually occurred Correct. Likewise, a lower crime rate *also* doesn't mean the police are doing a good job for exactly the same reason: you do not know the number of crimes that actually happened. So a lower crime rate cannot be used to draw a conclusion that a state is safer than others with a higher crime rate. The First thing I learn from statistics is how easily it can be manipulate or how it can have bias, > the people who do pursue higher education in UP & Bihar tend to do significantly better than their counterparts in Kerala Source? > You dont have the best thinkers/engineers/accountants/civil servants in kerala Again, source? I wonder if this is why police find every goddamn reason to file FIRs. Also you might get to hear this lines directly from a potbellied cop who doesn't want to do any work and will torment you into not filing case in the first place. OP check your sources before posting. This is shit data which doesn‚Äôt explain anything. Found the image on some random website. Bro that's some pretty hard reality altering filters you've got on. As a guy from UP, I don't have a source on this but I'll bet my left nut we been underreporting the numbers just a tad Murders not reported ? What are you talking about? Yes UP is very safe. For rapists and murderers. Don't we have more states? Even correct data can be misinterpreted. This one shows survivorship bias. Only cases that are registered are counted. maybe coz of very high population ? Yeah. I think people who become cop have a certain mindset and it is same in all states. I think even young Cops will give the same advice. I guess if complaint is filed officially, they actually have to do things. I think they just want to avoid actual work and paperwork. Is it hard to understand? Talk about the most literate state lol The numbers are based on the crimes being recorded. Just like Kerala was on top of covid cases because of high reporting they are on top of crimes because they are reported more. Punjab can't be this low. It seems to based on cases reported. lol, bhakt. how dare you talk about facts! /s Came here to say that. This is the ‚ÄúSpanish Flu‚Äù syndrome all over. During the flu outbreak 1 century ago, Spain was the only major country in the west not at war, so didn‚Äôt care about hiding statistics. Other countries saw flu stats as sensitive info and guarded it heavily. So from the outside it seemed that all flu cases came from Spain. Hence the Spanish Flu. The highest crime rate shown in Kerala is a positive thing. The crime rate is the number of registered crimes for every 100,000 people. It counts every crime from stealing a pen to missing mobile phones to trespassing to keeping the sound of the music system high to murder. It does not mean that a high number of crimes are happening in Kerala. It rather means that a large number of crimes are getting registered in Kerala. It means that people have trust in police, law and order. The people in Kerala are more educated and empowered. As a result, most of the incidents get reported. I've seen many people seeking police -intervention in issues that will never be reported anywhere else in India. In most states of India, police themselves refuse to register crimes so as to keep the number of crime rates low. But in Kerala, it is the direct opposite, here even the smallest cases are encouraged to be reported and registered. The Kerala police DGP himself has made it clear that the high crime rate is not a matter of concern, but is encouraging since it shows the strength and effectiveness of Kerala police. Kerala police is one of the most people-friendly police forces in our country. They introduced the Janmaithri policing a few years back, and it removed the 'fear of police' from the people's mind. They‚Äôre referring to the wrestlers‚Äô protest and how it took the SC to file FIRs against the accused. private buses have mowed people down in kerala too tbh. I recall an incident near my house during school. but I don't think it happened again much later. Just post the real numbers instead of sampling one lakh population lmao .This stat doesn't prove anything nor can be interpreted for any useful things U/nothefakedevesh I would like to see source. Because not all cases of violence are reported in UP to the police. Whereas in Kerala, almost everything get reported because the police is not intimidating and the corruption is less. Each and every petty crimes get reported in Kerala because police is accessible , not intimidating and little corruption. Whereas only very serious crimes gets reported in underdeveloped states where there are also high chances of corruption and inefficient policing > Murders are not easy to hide. Well, in India they are. Especially those committed due to societal/religious pressures. what's up with jharkhand ? The only reason is Kerala's documentation rate is highest, most of the crimes are actually registered unlike other states, specially the northern ones I think this. So even though the number of murders is very high, the murders/population is lower. But there are definitely a lot of murders that go unreported, like dowry deaths. They are just shoved aside as accidents. You‚Äôre missing the point. All crime is not the same. Civil crimes and sexual crimes have a higher chance of being reported in more developed states/countries. Why? For example, someone slapping another person is assault and/or battery in, say, Norway. And it could be just another day in a developing country. The same holds true for states in India. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt look at the total reported crimes and compare them directly. The tolerance level for every type of crime is unique to the environment where it was committed. What you can compare is violent crimes leading to death because the odds of those being reported is similar across different conditions. And that‚Äôs precisely why I linked homicide rates per state. Lol India and data. Kindly read the reply on autoMod comment Damn, MSDland be facing murders on murders Exactly, a lot of people like to act like India is not a country known for raping women by foreigners by pointing to the statistics ‚Äúbut.. but look at the numbers‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs only people of ____ faith‚Äù. Law enforcement is nothing short of incompetent in India and choosing to be ignorant towards issues like these is the root cause of the problem. Because in Kerala, we are not afraid to go to the police to file a complaint against a superior at work, a politician or a business man. If Punjab is lowest then I am not trusting the data Because Kerala and Gujarat have more effective record keeping and documentation of the crimes. Simple. I would imagine Kerala to be a place to REPORT a crime for you to obtain these internet clout chasy facts. Others names out here for it way worse trust me. And I‚Äôve never even been to Kerala myself, I just know it since having the highest literary rate of a state speaks volumes. Higher the reported crime rates means, people are not afraid to go to Police. And Police system is working correctly in that state. It‚Äôs more safer in places where crimes are reported. Some states still follow decisions from Pratham or Grama Mukhya. They don‚Äôt trust Police and report in Police stations. Try reporting a list phone ka fir. No one will take it People can't report crimes. I had my phone snatched some time ago. Police basically forced me to file a phone lost report which means they don't have to investigate. I knew they were not going to investigate any way, so I didn't For one thing, registering an FIR means a crime has happened which screws up their metrics. Plus they have to work, and who has time for work when there are bikers and small roadside stall owners to squeeze for extra income? Wouldn't be surprised if they take a cut from thieves/other criminals to not take any action. Do you know about 'Abraham Wald and the missing bullets' story ? Yuppp. I think they don't take cut from small thieves. Because they won't be able to afford it. They do get regular _hafta_ from multiple sources though. Actually WB would top the charts. /s What about Maharashtra I think I can answer this. Very few people from other states go to Kerala to study because (1) Kerala has no top tier non-medical educational institutions and (2) Kerala has more candidates than college seats, so there is not even enough space for local students. Many colleges in Karnataka and TN have significant Mallu population. > I also dont ever see mallu names come up often in higher echelons of other fields like engineering/accountancy/company secretaries/civil services, etc etc. Because they're all going to the Gulf countries or other places where they will get better salaries (and quality of life). Someone once told me that the city with the most Mallus is Dubai, and not Kochi. I don't know if that is true or exaggerated, but the service and management sectors in the Gulf countries are pretty much all run by Mallus. w cd Bengal kidhar hai? ü´¥ü§£ 1 party leader in Rajasthan raped over 200 girls , SCHOOL GIRLS. There were evidence in form of photos (he used this to blackmail them) , still it took 20 years for court to take action , giving only a meagre 6 year time in jail. Does this include all the FIRs that cops refuse to file? Or the crimes that people are too afraid to report? This list is absurd. Only the reported ones. Dude all the state police use Cctns system, where an individual can file a report on app. There may be low awareness in other states like UP or Bihar but states all states are one same level AFA recording of events is concerned. Please! India has a digital system for police and judiciary. There are shortcomings related to awareness and analytics but certainly the system is good for data collection. The only reason we are on top is we are the only people with the decency to report crime."
