Just tip of the iceberg.",

Usually secretaries handle ministries like fisheries,defence,finance,education etc etc. So someone who has spend his career in education sector or finance sector will have indepth knowledge than an IAS in same position. \n\nAbout my idea. \nUsually Block development officers,Tahsildars etc are posts given to state PCS officers.
