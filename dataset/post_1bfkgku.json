The only tangible difference anyone can make is to accept we have a problem and try and end this cycle of perpetuating rape culture. It has to do with the way all of us look at and value women as human beings, at every socioeconomic level, in every state and of every religion. Rapists arenâ€™t boogie men that jump out at night, out of nowhere. Theyâ€™re the people around us, our families, friends and colleagues, all set on the belief that women are commodities that they have a right over.\n\nThinking the way we do has made it acceptable for our government to respond to news of rape by voicing concerns about tourism or the coast guard to cover their liability in the recent news of child rape, rather than focusing on preventing things like this happening in the future and genuinely apologising for their part in allowing predators to slip under the cracks.

        "Socio-Cultural Norms: Traditional patriarchal norms often place women in subordinate positions in society. These norms can manifest in gender discrimination, including preferences for male children, which undermines the value and autonomy of women and girls.\n\nEconomic Factors: Economic dependency on male family members can leave women with limited personal freedom and decision-making power. This dependency is exacerbated by lower literacy and employment rates among women in certain areas, making it difficult for them to seek independence or escape abusive situations.\n\nLegal and Institutional Challenges: While India has robust laws aimed at protecting women's rights, the implementation and enforcement of these laws can be inconsistent. Delays in the legal process, under-reporting of crimes against women due to social stigma, and lack of trust in the police force contribute to a sense of impunity for perpetrators.\n\nEducation and Awareness: Limited access to education for women and girls, particularly in rural areas, restricts their socioeconomic opportunities and awareness of their rights. Education is a key factor in empowering women to stand up against abuses and discrimination.\n\nViolence and Harassment: Women in India face various forms of violence and harassment, including domestic violence, sexual assault, honor killings, and acid attacks. These acts are not only perpetrated by family members but also by others within the community, often reflecting deeper societal issues regarding gender norms and the value of women.\n\nPublic Safety and Infrastructure: Inadequate public safety measures, poor urban planning, and lack of secure transportation contribute to the vulnerability of women in public spaces. The fear of sexual harassment in public places limits women's mobility and their ability to participate fully in society.\n\nMedia and Representation: The portrayal of women in Indian media often reinforces stereotypes that can contribute to the normalization of violence against women. While there is a growing awareness and effort to challenge these portrayals, change is gradual.\n\nPolitical Representation: Although there have been significant strides in increasing women's representation in politics, women are still underrepresented in legislative bodies. Greater representation could lead to more focus on issues affecting women and more effective policies to address those issues.\n\nIt's crucial to note that these factors are deeply interrelated, and addressing the dangers faced by women in India requires a multifaceted approach that involves legal reform, education, economic empowerment, and societal change. The situation varies widely across different parts of the country, influenced by local cultural norms, economic conditions, and the effectiveness of law enforcement and social services.",

The parenting , the man in the center of the patriarchal, misogynistic structures, the retarded religious taboos , mothers raising girls as a weaker sex, the media content around us, all contributes to the epidemic which is only getting worse. Even in the best educated families , patriarchy, misogyny and sexism runs deep. There is not much to repair in an already morally corrupt world It may be beneficial for human beings to progressively modify their genetic makeup to increasingly adopt asexuality over time. [India is #95 on this list of global rape rates.](https://www.datapandas.org/ranking/rape-statistics-by-country) Each case is being widely exposed here on the internet, but globally India is doing better than most in this area. Obviously zero rapes would be ideal, but it may be rash to think India is worse than others. Hear me out! If India was not conservative, we wouldn't have so many cases. People would be liberated and it won't be a taboo so they won't resort to getting it the evil way 76% rape cases are fake only LMAO now you will counter with some women retake the offer but even some other report says around 50% are fake. even around 30-35% women think its ok to get beaten by hubsand/ Over 70% of rapes don't even get reported. India reported less than 1000 rapes of those under 18 in 2022. There were 30000 or so reported rapes in 2022. These are reported official numbers. Anyone who believes this number is ... India reported less than 1000 rapes of those under 18 in 2022. There were 30000 or so reported rapes in 2022. A lot of states like Gujarat, MH reported 0 under 18 rapes. These are reported official numbers. Anyone who believes this number is ... The main culprits are lack of education, items songs objectifying women basically 90% of songs in our movies, lack of law enforcement and access to porn. We need to address these on war footing. Even then it will take years before we see any drop in numbers. Our society has to reform from the bottom-line. Education should be the first step. Especially focusing on young adults and children. Teach them to communicate with women and girls within the same age group also teach them to understand about the opposite gender. We lack understanding towards the opposite gender, especially for males to females. Only communication and interaction towards each other can we understand both. Many have misconceptions towards each other. Like objectification, in my opinion, is a misconception because men don't understand women by a large margin. For example, You can only understand this much from books or references and the rest should be experienced or practiced. Like being a mother or father, doctors and parents can teach you something but the rest you have to experience (these are all examples, I don't have any better example to give). Pepper spray is a must! Don't why you are getting down voted. Many rapists are indeed psychopathic and sadistic in nature. They have no empathy that causes them to even feel a little bit of what the victim is going through. They also take delight in making the victim go through pain. The suggestions given by the other commenter are also good, but we have to look at this aspect as well. The psychological aspect to it. A lot of rape also happens due to power dynamics. Many predators get off to the fact that they have control over an entire person's body. Necrophilia, to some extent, has motives like this. Well, Society in short ðŸ¥². Castration to rapists honestly i dont think it has anything to do with being conservative or not in american here where its pretyy liberal have very high rape cases too expecially in colleges where its moslty liberal , i think there needs to be very strict punishement and also criminal need to stop being protocted and why is there identity being hidden All of this reminds me of a particular song I heard a while back. In it, there was a line that goes \"not all men, yes all men, need all men for what we're solving\". This directly calls out people who subvert the issue by saying that not all men are rapists. The thing is, this problem is deep-rooted in our society. And unless each and every man takes responsibility, it won't be solved. Plain and simple. Many cases reported in ame Uni are just fake. It's when people get drunk and perform the act and regret it the next morning so they label it as non consensual. Rape is a serious offence even in the United States they have the whole rape culture thing going on. Also, for valentine's day they give away free protection to students for std awareness. If a country is liberal where everyone sees sex at its face value and does not hide from it shy away from it, see it as a disgust, refrain from talking about it etc it becomes normal and people don't resort to violence. India is too backward when it comes to this aspect, parents dont communicate about physical needs, they refrain from sex education to their kids, if a school teach it, they ban and silence the school in the name of innocence. It is a basic human need and if everyone is so secret about it, some minority who are evil and vile will resort to it to fulfill their needs in an unconventional manner. I don't sympathise with evil, they are wrong but society is also wrong for provoking the evil It is about the system too. Police aren't trained to handle evidence properly. A rape and murder case dna evidence was unintentionally destroyed by police. The murders even confessed but that was overruled by supreme court and now they are free and raped another girl. > Cctv everywhere possible and give women free training on self defence ,pepper spray and Alarm whistle to alert people nearby. Local Govts can't keep traffic CCTVs running. Either they don't get or it gets eaten up earlier. We have numerous CCTVs that are non operational. > pepper spray and Alarm whistle to alert people nearby. Apart from like 1 or 2% cases, pepper spray and alarm whistle wouldn't really help. Of the high profile cases, how many are you going to be able to hit with pepper spray in 1vx scenarios. > With this teach kids from school to respect others. School already try to do it. It is the families and friends that fail. > 80% of cases the accused is from surroundings so staying alert & showing any kind of signs need to be alerted immediately. [94% of cases perpetrator known.](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/rapes-in-india-offenders-victim-minor-data-ncrb-1635691-2020-01-10) > In 15,972 of the total 33,356 rape cases, the offenders were either family friends or neighbour or employer or other known person, while in 12,568 cases, the offenders were friends or online friends or live-in partner on pretext of marriage or separated husband, the data stated. > In 2,780 cases, the victims were violated by their own family members, while only in 2,036 cases the offenders were unknown to them, according to the statistics. Majority of rape cases don't really happen where other people can help. And, you won't have pepper spray in hand unless you are already scared, not the case with people you know. Start brothels. And you seriously think that's a good thing. I pity the women in your life. No-one is saying man rape does not happen but here we are talking about rape against women and it does not make sense to talk about men when talking about women We are currently playing \"Hindu khatre me hai\" Will play this in the next term >India, we have a rape problem. What are we doing about it? Whataboutism > Cctv everywhere possible and give women free training on self defence ,pepper spray and Alarm whistle to alert people nearby. > Make parents aware to take extra care & keep a watch in there neighbourhood. > 80% of cases the accused is from surroundings so staying alert & showing any kind of signs need to be alerted immediately. The stopgap seems to be living in a police state, where we are constantly driven by fear of our surroundings and people in it. > With this teach kids from school to respect others. We keep insisting this even today. What exactly different do you want to teach ? > Villages & Rural area need education & teach them to change mentality. Ummm a lot of violence happens in urban areas. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a village & rural area problem. I personally think we need throw our entire Indian cultural norms and society in the garbage and start afresh. The only thing that will actually help solve the problem is a massive cultural revolution, where people start questioning our societal structures and belief systems. Socio-Cultural Norms: Traditional patriarchal norms often place women in subordinate positions in society. These norms can manifest in gender discrimination, including preferences for male children, which undermines the value and autonomy of women and girls. Economic Factors: Economic dependency on male family members can leave women with limited personal freedom and decision-making power. This dependency is exacerbated by lower literacy and employment rates among women in certain areas, making it difficult for them to seek independence or escape abusive situations. Legal and Institutional Challenges: While India has robust laws aimed at protecting women's rights, the implementation and enforcement of these laws can be inconsistent. Delays in the legal process, under-reporting of crimes against women due to social stigma, and lack of trust in the police force contribute to a sense of impunity for perpetrators. Education and Awareness: Limited access to education for women and girls, particularly in rural areas, restricts their socioeconomic opportunities and awareness of their rights. Education is a key factor in empowering women to stand up against abuses and discrimination. Violence and Harassment: Women in India face various forms of violence and harassment, including domestic violence, sexual assault, honor killings, and acid attacks. These acts are not only perpetrated by family members but also by others within the community, often reflecting deeper societal issues regarding gender norms and the value of women. Public Safety and Infrastructure: Inadequate public safety measures, poor urban planning, and lack of secure transportation contribute to the vulnerability of women in public spaces. The fear of sexual harassment in public places limits women's mobility and their ability to participate fully in society. Media and Representation: The portrayal of women in Indian media often reinforces stereotypes that can contribute to the normalization of violence against women. While there is a growing awareness and effort to challenge these portrayals, change is gradual. Political Representation: Although there have been significant strides in increasing women's representation in politics, women are still underrepresented in legislative bodies. Greater representation could lead to more focus on issues affecting women and more effective policies to address those issues. It's crucial to note that these factors are deeply interrelated, and addressing the dangers faced by women in India requires a multifaceted approach that involves legal reform, education, economic empowerment, and societal change. The situation varies widely across different parts of the country, influenced by local cultural norms, economic conditions, and the effectiveness of law enforcement and social services. Stricter punishment and cctv camera SOS boxes that contact police like in korea and bengalore are some mandatory requirements Sex Ed, high surveillance India has a poverty problem, drop a trillion dollars on indian and most of these issues will vanish overnight >The parenting , the man in the center of the patriarchal, misogynistic structures, the retarded religious taboos , mothers raising girls as a weaker sex, the media content around us, all contributes to the epidemic which is only getting worse. I really believe mandating sex education in schools and taking actions against influencers who promote misogynistic content will help to some extent. and only government can do it. All the men in my family are super respectful and considerate. But you can look it up and there's NUMEROUS surveys. Most popular article by deccan herald Unpopular opinion: do not travel alone or at night to unfamiliar areas. Do not leave your daughter and women alone with men even if they are relative. Prevention is better than cure, where rape is prevalent. There's no point waiting for the society to change. Just protect yourself. Almost every woman knows this and does this already, so this being a solution for rape prevention is like beating a dead horse. Even if women did exclusively this, at what point do we curb our existence? Normalising â€˜women shouldnâ€™t existâ€™ is the end goal of a suggestion like this. Itâ€™s also then the responsibility of the victim to prevent rape and not society as a whole. If never seeing women (like in middle eastern cultures and to a lesser but abnormal level in India) out and about living their lives becomes the cultural norm, women that do so become â€˜abnormalâ€™ and worthy of mistreatment. Itâ€™s the places and cultures where women donâ€™t exist unless shrouded by men where rape culture is strongest. So yea, weâ€™ll be safe, but also moving backwards and giving half the population even less autonomy than before. Society won't change so just protect yourself. These discussions are futile. This discussions are necessary, regardless of how futile they appear in the short term. If your solution is to never speak up, you're pandering to a defective society. Society is rotten. You'll still be having this same discussion in 2047. Are you trying to say nobody should discuss it because it bothers you? Or that nobody should discuss changes we need just because they seem impossible? Either is a shitty outlook. The whole 'look the other way and don't get involved' is either a privileged or perpetuating stance. > Honestly, you guys are naive af. Rapists are in general psychopaths/sadists (1 in 100 people), they feel no remorse on others sadness. Thereâ€™s no amount of sexEd or anything of this sort thatâ€™s gonna prevent this. Exactly. It doesn't bother me. My comment was towards individuals. Protect your daughters, wives, sisters, and mothers. Society is rotten to the core, and don't wait for it to reform. Prevention is better than cure."
