    "selftext": "Hey Folks,\n\nOur gorgeous doggo Barfi is looking for her home. \n\nBarfi has been abandoned by her previous owners who neglected her for so long. And yet she is a force of energy. We are fostering her at our place in Noida. Within just three weeks of love and care, her true personality has blossomed. She loves to SING and runs as fast as a horse lol. We got to see her loving side too. If one wants to know what it is to love fiercely, they should meet Barfi. For she would make you feel so loved. \n\nThis girl is a unique beautiful mix of Spitz and himalayan dog. There is no other like Barfi. She has been spayed and her vaccinations are up to date. We would prefer a home in Delhi/NCR but her adoption is open pan India for the right family.\n\nReddit doesn't allow sharing contact info. So please dm in case of any leads and I would get back in no time",
