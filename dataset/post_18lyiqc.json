    "selftext": ">Not even a single educational institution in such a vast country with the world's oldest knowledge tradition is amongst the top 50 educational institutions of the world. We need to think about it. The race for ranking is not more important than a good education. But good ranking not only attracts students and good faculty from all over the world but also enhances the reputation of the country,” she said.\n\nPresident Murmu called upon IIT Kharagpur, the oldest IIT in the country, to make efforts in this direction.\n\n\"Institutions like IIT Kharagpur will have to play an important role through innovation and technology. They will have to make revolutionary efforts to develop technology and implement it,\" she added.\n\nShe commended the institute for aligning with the government's policy of internationalisation and global collaboration.",

We should definitely do that but there is something called as reasonable proportions. \n\nSee, in any case I have lost any hope of fairness in our education system. \n\nBut my only point is, if the goal of an IIT is to uplift people then admit it dammit.

It is because of them we aren't Top X, there isn't enough funding, there isn't enough focus on research. Indian Universities don't really focus on academia as much as Ivy League Universities. \n\nThey don't really have enough funds to fund startup or file patents at 5% rate, they still file patents but very few. The cream of the crop in Indian institutes are the bachelors, most of them go out to Institute like Harvard that pay enough to live in US and get jobs in US which we pay much higher than bachelors. While in India, PhD will reduce your chances of employment and most places won't pay extra for masters student or even PhDs.",

The judge literally felt ashamed writing it's judgement as this still happens .\n\nHow can a cobbler son and a priest son compete in a fair manner? Will both be respected at the same level. If you need an end to reservation you should abolish the caste factor and I think it won't happen in the near future.\n\nIIT are the worst place with caste discrimination. \n\n>See, in any case I have lost any hope of fairness in our education system.\n\nJust go to any IIT and say that you are from any dalit wing  group and you need to do some sort of research to look at their response.

We need to think about it. The race for ranking is not more important than a good education. But good ranking not only attracts students and good faculty from all over the world but also enhances the reputation of the country,” she said. President Murmu called upon IIT Kharagpur, the oldest IIT in the country, to make efforts in this direction. \"Institutions like IIT Kharagpur will have to play an important role through innovation and technology. They will have to make revolutionary efforts to develop technology and implement it,\" she added. She commended the institute for aligning with the government's policy of internationalisation and global collaboration.",

She did commend IIT for aligning with the government's policies. This is a good thing /s I don’t think Indian universities could reach that. They focus on academia too much. 0 efforts on other stuff. True. In Harvard students are starting spinoffs, filing patents, publishing books and even though 95% fail they are not afraid because uni's got their back. In terms of academic india is top even in practical work but the problem is in the equipment we still use old hardware in your iits and medical uni's Otherwise I feel like the student output of our institutions is good Like most of silicon valley in world is filled with iitians We need to improve on infra and new learning techniques I totally forgot about her Haan Lekin Modi ke saath selfie to ho rahi hai na. Phir rank ka kya kaam? why don't you increase reservation even in the tier 1 institutes? Talking about competing with the best universities in the world when they don't respect merit. Oh the irony. Rename all IITs to MITs (Modis institoot of teknawlagy) and watch the ratings go up. /s India should focus much more of its education budget on primary schools and other forms of basic education. Improving vast swats of people to reasonable levels of literacy makes so much more impact on the country than having a single or even a handful of high-ranked universities. But optics and a suffocating social stratification won't make it happen anyway. WhatsApp University must be there. She might have missed it. I am not contending the problem you are speaking of here but just wanted to mention that even institutes in US have affirmative action where they look at race and ethnicity etc. Dont they? meanwhile IIT Delhi doing research on cow science 😭 suspension incoming /s (please don't suspend me) Wait what Shh! You are trying to shatter their idea of reality I asked my college if they can provide a server for our projects, or sponsor some courses which me and my friends were interested in (they give a high discount if the college sponsors them) but was always denied. I asked my college if they can provide a server for our projects, or sponsor some courses which me and my friends were interested in (they give a high discount if the college sponsors them) but was always denied. Someone who knows better can elaborate but I am pretty sure its not similar in the scale or in effect. 60% percent reservation, are you freaking kidding me!? In an institute where you are expected to take academics to the highest possible standards, you admit people on basis of their caste and creed? How is that supposed to eliminate casteism? I am more conscious of my caste cause we are segregated based on it even today. And I am not against reservation for economically weaker section. We should definitely do that but there is something called as reasonable proportions. See, in any case I have lost any hope of fairness in our education system. But my only point is, if the goal of an IIT is to uplift people then admit it dammit. How dare you then to keep expectations that IIT's will compete with top 50 universities in the world!!!? Do any of them have 60% reservation? Is that how they got there? Logon ki mandbuddhi se pareshaan hun main bas. wait till you realise most top universities in the world have quotas to ensure diversity especially in the usa and how much % is that out of the total seats O learned saint? Please enlighten me. Wait till you realize they are stopping this based on the supreme court verdict. Also wait till you realize research clearly showing thst affirmative action students just drop out of these majors because they cannot compete with those who came in through more competitive means. Supreme court verdict page 40 at the bottom feel free to send me research that proves otherwise. Shhh….. we like to punch down on the less fortunate. Wasn't affirmative action repealed? affirmative action being stopped doesn’t mean they’ll be admitting students purely based on merit. diversity still will play a part in admissions to ensure representation. as for students dropping out, there will also be students who have benefited from being admitted as it helps lift them from their disadvantaged situation do i think reservation is flawless? no. but does it help people especially in a country like India where the caste system is so ingrained? yes Do you know what is the budget of Harvard and what is the budget of IITs? ($1.1 billion for all IITs vs [Harvard operating expense is $5.9 billion with $50 billion endowment](https://finance.harvard.edu/files/fad/files/fy23_financial_overview.pdf)) Any time these politicians state about our education institutes not being in Top X, they should be shown the mirror. It is because of them we aren't Top X, there isn't enough funding, there isn't enough focus on research. Indian Universities don't really focus on academia as much as Ivy League Universities. They don't really have enough funds to fund startup or file patents at 5% rate, they still file patents but very few. The cream of the crop in Indian institutes are the bachelors, most of them go out to Institute like Harvard that pay enough to live in US and get jobs in US which we pay much higher than bachelors. While in India, PhD will reduce your chances of employment and most places won't pay extra for masters student or even PhDs. I understand the point of economic benefit for minorities and in our case marginalized groups however saying my point was that reservation and affirmative action absolutely do not make education at these institutions better. They help society and if anything lower the education bar. It's a lie. Just open your what'sapp you will find resources untouched by experts in all fields of science and join a RSS group they will take lessons at least 100 yrs more advanced than the current syllabus. Maybe she is an Anti nation. Only PM is on the top internationally. Let them do it and send all bjp members in that plane. Maybe India will get its real freedom Funding is needed for educational institutions to reach such ranks What kind of server ? colleges never help. it’s the seniors and clubs that can. maybe some professors. but not the institute 60% reservation for how much of the population again? I am not here to defend India, but those lists are very much biased. The courses are very specialized on small topics. I have friends who opted for foreign entrance exams because GATE was too tough for them. Even the final year thesis can be skipped if additional subjects are taken in some cases. Although, my experience with these foreign exams is only limited to acing ASME courses and a university in Texas' design exam >60% percent reservation, are you freaking kidding me!? In an institute where you are expected to take academics to the highest possible standards, you admit people on basis of their caste It's needed we can't eliminate it ,but they can increase the institution size . What stops them from opening even more IITs . One of the staff in IIT Madras was not made as HOD bcs she is a dalit and she filed a case against it and they made her HOD on the evening of her retirement. The judge literally felt ashamed writing it's judgement as this still happens . How can a cobbler son and a priest son compete in a fair manner? Will both be respected at the same level. If you need an end to reservation you should abolish the caste factor and I think it won't happen in the near future. IIT are the worst place with caste discrimination. >See, in any case I have lost any hope of fairness in our education system. Just go to any IIT and say that you are from any dalit wing group and you need to do some sort of research to look at their response. You will see thier real face . >Do any of them have 60% reservation? Is that how they got there? Do harward and mit discriminate PPL in this way ? Sure, - Budget of Education and R&D consistently decreasing for the last 10 years (as % of GDP and YES IT MATTERS) - Increasing % of Quota & Affirmative action vs merit (in both students & reaching staff) - Calibration of academic output in terms of papers published vs citations (if you don't know what citations are, don't share your opinion ) - Revising curriculum focused on History rather than Science - Creating narratives like Vedas are source of all knowledge, ayurveda > medical science, temples were jet engines, gomutra can cure cancer, so why would youth bother about modern science, we already know everything! But of course, IIT Kharagpur has to make efforts. If I call this one a rubberstamp president, even the rubberstamp would be insulted. It may be the best out of 1 thoujand colleje Now that she's acknowledged the issue she can work towards a solution. Starting with herself. Grow a spine and stop pandering to the Fuhrer's will. /s Absolutely right, we need more educated PPL than very few top notch ppls and those creamy layer PPL will flee to us once they get graduated. We need to make larger movement by making primary and secondary schools well structured. 👍 Recently a japanese Startup tested the Use of cow dung as fuel for its space vehicle [https://www.scmp.com/video/technology/3245057/company-using-cow-dung-fuel-japans-space-ambitions](https://www.scmp.com/video/technology/3245057/company-using-cow-dung-fuel-japans-space-ambitions) Exactly to be like Harvard and NASA you have to fund the Indian institutions like Harvard and NASA. And it's not like we don't have money. There is plenty of income from different sources. Indian government annual income is around 450 billion dollars. We need to reduce unnecessary waste of money privatising incompetent services like RTO, electrical department, etc and there will be plenty of money to fund education. Gomuthra infused rocket fuel was the missing link between mankind and interstellar travel. India leading the way to supremacy. Post about Anything bad in India, and an upper caste idiot would start barking like a 🐶 and blame reservations. Your roof is leaking? It must be those pesky deletes. Your wife is infertile? These reservation guys are responsible. Flat tire? Blame the deletes again. Requesting all janeudharis, please read the QS world ranking report at least once before blabbering like buffoons here. No matter who the students or the teachers are you can turn an IIT into Harvard without providing the same resources as Harvard. Their annual spending is 6 billion dollars with an endowment of 50 billion dollars. So even if 999 startups fail 1 will become Facebook and the stock options will give the uni multifold returns. It is almost as if, top crop of students go to ivy league specifically. They are already rich, intelligent and with good connections. The most important thing in development of a person is Circle around him, which is unbeatable there. Or the world should include “moral policing” in their uni ranking algorithm and see how we rank higher. Yet another conspiracy against india by phorein countries :insert rage.png: > I am more conscious of my caste cause we are segregated based on it even today. Jab tere ghar mein log takle hote hai tab jaat yaad nhi aati? Ya jab teri qaum wale chamaro ko mandir mei aane se mana karte hai tab jaat yaad nahi aati? Ya jab tera baap sirf apni qaum walo ko ghar kiraye pe deta hai tab nhi aati? Indian education runs of rote learning and puking everything that you memorised onto a couple of answer sheets. You do realise that a large percentage of ppl in unis like Harvard are legacies and international students—both are rich by default. The amount of underprivileged kids in Harvard is very very slim. Not even WhatsApp university 🤔 That's where you go if you want an Ignoble prize. Yooooo....that is legit true.....😳 Here is the link from the start-up how is that relevant to my argument? You are right, time to scrap off economically weaker section category This govt has been quietly reducing spending on education esp research and higher end stuff. So many grants have been closed, fees increased for MTech etc with reduced funding. If they have to build more central Vistas and temples and increase their salaries the money needs to come out of somewhere else. If we find Indian institutes like Harvard, how will babus swindle cash to their pockets? Need to ensure they are sufficiently stuffed too /s Ensuring people don't get educated is a standard right wing tactic almost everywhere. Wait till IT cell shows up saying why spend money on western research. Let's learn Ramayanam and mahabharatam. True. They probably would have a very interesting albeit illogical justification for that too. Define underprivileged. Even leave it on the students part, I am speaking about discrimination among staff and professors . How is that justified. More over some ppls have 40 % quota don't blame reservation for it . Some Ppls can speak multiple virtue from cities and pretend that caste doesn't exist. Leave IIT can Dalits enter in temples? RESERVATION IS A NORM HERE AND IF YOU NEED TO GET RID OF IT LEAVE YOUR CASTE SHIT . As long as adani and ambani aren’t the ones. If you educate people, they won't vote for Hindu-Muslim. So yeah, no party in power is going to really focus on education ever. Well, the late Pranab Mukherjee was a completely different kind of person. She has different strengths and I feel she should have been a minister - some kind of active position based on her past work. But I think most of these people have scripted speeches. I mean they're not expected to learn everything. lmao why involving religion when the study is on use of dung as fuel From APJ Abdul Kalam to a rubber stamp So far we have Ministry of AYUSH, we are doomed. Imagine crores of money wasted on Pseudoscience of Homeopathy Not anymore.. A few months ago they called it off.. I forgot the amendment they passed but you can check it on the internet. No. It's the lack of focus on research that holds back Indian universities. Academia with a heavy touch of \"do what I say\". Egoistic professors exist everywhere, but we have a disproportionate amount of them in our universities who do not want to actually contribute anything to their field. I agree however the problem at the moment in India is that a lot of people basic literacy skills and they're easily manipulated. You need to teach deductive reasoning which generally happens in university. Basic education is great but there needs to be a path for trade skills or university down the line. It's insane about the paper publication thing. My uni forces students to pay to publish a paper in whatever toilet paper journal they have a tie up or something with. The papers are usually random rubbish or stuff that is not novel or contributive in any way, but it doesn't matter. All that matters is they get their quota of number of papers published. Many of my classmates don't even know what they published, they just ask ChatGPT to write something, ask it to generate a list of references, and don't even check if the papers they supposedly cited even exist. If you are expecting Engineering colleges to be the best universities in world then maybe you are on wrong page. That's naïve. Lots of \"educated\" people with graduate and even post-graduate degrees are highly bigoted. \"Unfortunately\" Why? Can we really compare Harvard to IIT? Harvard is a private institution with a lot of donations by their alum. IITs don’t really get that, except from the government. Maybe some of the other private institutions- maybe BITS, Manipal could go down this route? She's been doing significant work though. It's insincere to dismiss her like that. Sorry, can't hear you amidst the sound of the 73 derivations I'm practicing. affirmative action didn't go through. read up on it. Because all the best Indian teachers are teaching at foreign universities Because they get paid in dollars Like? Her political career is filled with lots of accomplishments too, it's just that media doesn't cover her much bec their attention is somewhere else We'll for starters, she stood up to CJI and called out their elitist behavior on a public stage. She made a point that a lot of common/poor/disadvantaged people just simply never see the light of Justice because of how broken the whole justice system is and implored the CJI to bring significant changes. I liked that. I feel that the core reason for Indian common culture is soo poor is because there is severe lack of justice, respect for law and respectable laws. Any effort in that direction is praise worthy. Oh! She can talk. Agreed, I know so many unis where PhDs are basically research paper factories, they copy paste recycle whatever to just spam papers (a+b)² = a²+b²+2ab , ye extra 2ab kaha se aya IIT Madras is researching gaumutra and its cancer related benefits. It is okay to miss the bus and arrive late. It is NOT okay to take the wrong route and expect that you'll reach the destination. Too many educated people is not good for the country's politics.Where else will the parties get their cadres from? Who else is going to vote for BJP is people become educated? 100% this. Moreover, they have placed GST on procurement of sophisticated instruments in institutions while the allocated budget has reduced greatly. Remuneration for pursuing research is still peanuts and contingency is not enough even for peanut shells. Remember the hullabaloo around cow science during COVID time? They even had an entrance planned for that stupidity which was thankfully scrapped off later. They need pseudo environmentalists to get clearance for minting their monies The whole PhD system is terribly fckd up here. Starting from getting admission based on favoritism to doing bogus research and publish in some vague journal that somehow finds it way to CARE list. And these authors recommend their friends' name as reviewers and also provide the exact comments to be submitted to the journal. I automatically lose respect for any person who's done or doing a PhD from a non reputed institute. I mean, we have around 1000 government unis and if you can't make it to a good one, then how good do you think you are to be a researcher. And to top it all, these very people go on to be professors and guide the next gen. Absolutely pathetic. A decent world ranking is light years away. Just saw a post of the removef subjects from NCERT. Yea we gonna be… uhh rock bottom with the next generation of uneducated Foreign institutions are in par with current technological trends, I was in US visiting our head office and also a training, a professor from local community College came in to teach for the two day seminar and I was amazed on how much I could learn practically from him, I wouldn't say he knew anything and everything but he could really critique our old projects and give genuine solutions to problems we face, would it be possible in India, never I guess. And the acads the teach is mostly useless Tell iit to give placement to the students they have there first😭😂 Majority of Research works published in India is plagiarised and there’s an organised sector working to reuse a standard research publication for as many folks as possible. The reason is UGC grants are tied to number of papers published and PhDs created from the institutes. There is also a number of research journals that operate in India to publish these fake research papers and they charge people for it. A part of the money from these journals go to so called committees that oversee educational institutions nationally to ensure they are not banned or blacklisted. The entire system is rotten to the core. The entire system needs to be replaced with an outcome based funding where patents and internationally peer reviewed research is mandated. If institutions focus on academia then there should be more internationally acclaimed research publications and patents from them. How many do we have ? Also this \"Indian Institute of Technology\" will have to become \"Indian Institute of Education\", move away from pigeonholed focus on only Engineering, start basic sciences, humanities, social sciences, economics, literature, arts and many more departments. As of right now, IITs are akin to the engineering department of big US universities, nothing more. Also this \"Indian Institute of Technology\" will have to become \"Indian Institute of Education\", move away from pigeonholed focus on only Engineering, start basic sciences, humanities, social sciences, economics, literature, arts and many more departments. As of right now, IITs are akin to the engineering department of big US universities, nothing more. Pretty early to talk about Top 50. * ARWU (Shanghai) ranking put IISc Bangalore at **301-400** in ranking. (the top in India). * QS university ranking has IITB at the top in India at **149**. IISc dropped from 152 last year to 225 this year. (QS has added 3 new parameters for their ranking this year). * In US NWR ranking, TIFR is at the top for India with a ranking of **452**. * Times put IISc at **201-250** range. * CWTS Leiden ranking - IIT Kharagpur tops their list at **274** (in terms of total publications), **374** (in top 10% publications). In percentage of publications in 10% of their respective field category -- IIT Dhanbad (formerly ISM) topped the ranking at **646**. And before anyone claim the *conspiracy*, take QS for example. It gives 20% weight-age for \"Employer Reputation and Employment outcomes\" -- both category top Indian institutes benefit enormously for having a contrived monopolistic access to a > 1.4 population set. While, only 10% of the weight-age are given to \"International faculty and International students\". (both are quite important to be honest, but is something people in India like to complaint about). The factor that accounts for poor ranking of Indian institutes the most is subpar academic record (given most weight-age in every ranking). bracket wala square kaha gaya..u aunty nasha anal bracket wala square kaha gaya..u aunty nasha anal Yeah that's the whole point of IITs. There are Universities for what you're describing. that's why I said > As of right now, IITs are akin to the engineering department of big US universities, nothing more. Like I said, that's the point of IITs. They aren't intended to be much more than STEM schools. Then don't crib about rankings and compare with full fledged universities. As an engineering school, IITs are pretty good. Hong Kong alone has 5 universities in top 100 in latest QS ranking. I don't know how entire India can't get one. She’s holding the office of an independent institution of democracy but watching it die I’m fairly certain I have never been asked for my caste in any temple, nor have seen anyone else be asked the same and I have been to almost every major temple in india except Tirumala and Somnath. Don’t you see, we’re at a point we’re reservation is actively leading to disdain for the reserved castes? Medical education also has gone to the dogs - A guy paid 6 crores to get his son into an MD program in Orthopedics , most med colleges and post-grad programs want “donations” for admissions. Such Educational places are money-pits and produce grads laser focused on earning it back and some more , not medicine what do you mean by \"moral policing\"? Usually it's placements and quality of education. Most students leave in first year of IITs are reserved ones who never deserved that in the first place. Also we are still stuck teaching age old foundry in mechanical when no one in the west even studies about it. I think the university that offers MA in entire political science tanks ranks above Harvard We need gurukul based gosikhsha to get back to the top of the education sector. Its a sarcasm. We need to tell ourself that 90% of what our BJP government (and Congress did the same) call indigenous, are just rebadged technology. ISRO should set standard for others. Yeah, with scientific funding ducted to gobar research, and bigots coming out of the woodwork in Old iits to reiterate their caste superiority, we should prepare for drop in rankings. For the amount of teouble the bjp bas fomented in universities, I think this is an achievement.you can't have illiterate folks dictate which cow's shit is more medicinal etc. Indian education institutes are just \"ratta maaro\" shops. Essentially sarkaari babus teaching to the syllabus. Passing exams is all that matters. Yeah more or less Anything else? Boys and girls walking together, curfew for girls, restricted movements out of campus, non veg curbs, no student unions etc I still don't get how it changes the ranking of our universities. The implication is that they would be ranked worse if these are considered Oh right That's the kind of research that will get most funding Exactly what Meghnad Saha always tried to make Nehru understand. Dude come with me I will show at least 10 temples in natives which won't allow Dalits to enter into the temple . See my point is not to criticize you but those ppls are underprivileged than us . I too tried for JEE and other exams. It's pretty hard to crack iam from a tier 1 city .Imagine a person from native village that won't even have access to books their parents find it hard to educate them until the 10th. How can those PPL compete with someone whose father works in a well paid job ,who knows the value of education, and who has multiple access networks compete in a fair way ? It's like fixing a match between Olympic athletes and road side runners and saying that's a fair game . Caste culture in tier 1 city is different from caste culture in villages and tier 2 cities . If you are in tier 1 city you can't see that clearly that doesn't mean that there's no caste discrimination at all. >\"Institutions like IIT Kharagpur will have to play an important role through innovation and technology. They will have to make revolutionary efforts to develop technology and implement it,\" she added. I thought that was part of their charter, so nobody was innovating all along in any of these \"elite institutions\"? >She commended the institute for aligning with the government's policy of internationalisation and global collaboration. Again, these should all be implicit goals, no need to fucking make a statement, it's not that special ....especially since...you know aligning is not really necessary, the Government _is_ IITs sugar daddy, I would expect them to align, no matter what lol. Colleges aim for number of placements to attract new batches Schools aim to get air to boost their enrollment Parents want those children to score marks and get to iit or mbbs In all the number games the part education goes missing My niece says they are allowed to use calculator ls from 5th standard because thats what is used in real world. We ask our children to mug the table Cbsc and ncert is targeting only for the written and aptitude test and there is no emphasis on self development Corrupt education system >need to vote babus out of power I don't think you understand who \"babus\" are. They aren't going anywhere irrespective of which political party is in power. Anti nationals need to be voted out ! Bruh the term \"Babus\" refers to Bureaucrats, who aren't going anywhere irrespective of which party comes into power. Stop being so dense Please don’t be hyperbolic. This is the most educated generation in Indian history. Even if the government isn’t footing the bill, people are taking loans and sending their children to college. Can you actually show any data for a drop in enrollment at tertiary education anywhere in India? The US government doesn’t fund Harvard. It’s a private institute that has private donors. No government anywhere in the world funds any institution to the tune of Harvard’s endowments. That’s why there’s only one Harvard in the world. They’re also building roads, railway lines, drinking water pipelines, gas pipelines, airports, power plants etc. at a rate never before seen in India. Please be fair. The budget for education has always been minuscule. Clearly not well enough because number of railway accidents are increasing. You deleted your comment? Here’s my response anyway: You don’t even read the articles you link do you? Why bother talking about education? Your article on railway accidents blames manpower shortages, not the quality of infrastructure. It’s literally the first line. > Only the Education Cess (MUSK) has decreased and, as a result, it appears that the Gross Budget Allocation has decreased as well. The Actual Budget Allocation increased from ₹40,828.35 crore (FY 2022-23) to ₹44,094.62 crore (FY 2023-24) and this is the actual budget that will be made available to the Department of Higher Education for use during the fiscal year 2023–24. That’s from the second article. Btw, please don’t force me to defend this nonsense. I actually believe the budget for R&D and education is pitifully low, and I constantly support raising it. I’m just saying we should be fair to the government so as not to make bad choices in the future. If Modi was replaced tomorrow, Indian education wouldn’t get any better. Decades of experience shows this. That was not my comment. You are responding to the wrong commenter Ok. Well, it’s still annoying when these clowns bait and switch. It’s practically the same move the Modi IT cells use. Again responding to the wrong person. This is my post. I am the op I don't know who and who are playing what. Go talk to them directly It is about money. GOI does not even put 5 percent into education. What do you expect then? True OMG, why did she say that? Will she get suspended now? Ahaa hear comes this good old BS why aim for something higher when rest can't get basics ! Lol so Uni of Mumbai or Uni of Delhi higher up in the rankings ? No why is that ? Also most of Indian Unis don't have foreign students and that is one of the factors taht comes to play in this situation."
