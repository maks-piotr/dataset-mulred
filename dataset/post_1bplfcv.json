    "selftext": "I \"was\" a Modi blind supporter or the \"Andh B\" (IDK, if we can say it publicly here or not), I fell into the trap of their marketing gimmick, I wasn't even into politics before 2013, they were quite good at this (now better). Just like any other young chap these days, I started trolling other politicians to the extent that I was blocked by a few of them and their official handles.\n\nIn 2016, Demonetisation happened, I could sense the pain people were going through and I started asking a series of questions such as \"Why isn't he acknowledging the death of people?\", \"Did he make such stupid decisions in past which I'm not aware of because I'm blinded by blind faith in this guy?\" \"Why isn't he accepting his mistakes under his period as a PM? and asking to the extent \"Is he even a good guy?\"\n\nThe year is 2019, I used to talk to this friend of mine a lot, we used to troll other politicians together because we were both blind supporters of Modiji (until I wasn't). I texted her a couple of weeks before the election, Here's how it went:\n\n>Me: \"Sup? Who are you gonna vote?\".  \n>  \n>She: Of course, Modiji. How about you?  \n>  \n>Me: Maybe \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ this time.  \n>  \n>She: WTF? Are you stupid or what?  \n>  \n>Me: He's done good work, *yada yada yada* (some more logical points I thought were relevant in 2019)  \n>  \n>She: You're stupid, just dumbfuck. You should vote for Modi.\n\nHer behaviour completely changed during that conversation after this point, we weren't friends anymore was the vibe I was getting from here so it's been 5 years since we last talked. At some point, this would have happened with a lot of you or will happen at once.\n\nWhen I mentioned previously that they're better at this now, I can recall vividly people talking politics in my hometown or nearby in general, one would be supporting BJP, one would support Congress and someone would support others.\n\nI never heard them yelling during discussions, I never saw any of them angry in a discussion, and I never saw any of them bailing a discussion because someone was asking stronger and valid questions. (Yeah, it all started with Modi's interview, when he bailed out of the discussion).\n\nIt's 2024 now, we are in the narrative of Modi vs Who? Either you're supporting BJP or you're a Congressi or some other party. This is the reason I stopped having discussions with any Tom, Narendra or Harry around me. What's the point of having a discussion when you can't even discuss it?\n\nIf I say Yes Rahul has no experience, and I'm a Modi supporter, if I say this action from Modi is wrong, I am leftist, if I abuse both of them I'm a liberal. When I disagree with something a liberal or a communist says, then I'm something else, a new category. If people can't think of a tag or category to label you, you're being abused. Now we've reached a stage where people have only 2 tags \"with BJP or AGAINST BJP\"\n\nAs a wise man once said:**\"Merciless criticism and independent thinking are two traits of revolutionary thinking. Lovers, lunatics and poets are made of the same stuff\" - BHAGAT SINGH**\n\nSo, I would say F\\*CK BJP and F\\*CK everyone else, you are entitled to have your own opinion. Let go of people rather than killing your thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l553hgekszqc1.jpg?width=327&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=842e55d141469b1413b605aaac0b8903e904532b",

        "i was political all my life . followed politics from when i was in grade 3. was a supporter of bjp for 20 yrs till demonitization happened. people see demonitization as oh modiji did a mistake , it was a good step. that is because they dont know modi uncle. he is far ruthless than the most ruthless person you have ever known. there are so many layers to demonitization that i got tired peeling them. Manmohan Singh the ex PM summarized it well in the parliament - organized loot, legalized plunder. they took all the cash in peoples pockets and put them in the pockets of corporate and thats one layer. bank interest rates fell due to high deposits, the loan books of corporates got written off as NPAs, the black money which corporates and bjp was holding got converted to white. it was a scheme to convert black to white and not for catching black money. this was just one of the goals. imagine he made the whole country suffer for this.",
